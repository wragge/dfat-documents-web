Cablegram M77 LONDON, 22 April 1941, 8.39 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Publication here of complaints by members of Parliament and others is doing our reputation harm. Your own reported statements and those of Spender [1] are excellent and breathe a spirit of courage and defiance which is regarded as in true Australian tradition.

Our losses are very small compared with those of say Scotland. It would be a pity for a few politicians to impair our high reputation in this country. Churchill has this afternoon refused a war debate, and the public morale is good.

Regards,

MENZIES

1 Minister for the Army.
