Cablegram 24 3 January [1941] [1],

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

For your urgent consideration and reply. I am a good deal exercised about projected visit to Great Britain as political position here precarious and principal lieutenants in Cabinet not very experienced. However I feel strongly that much mutual benefit might result from visit provided I could be sure of prompt and sufficient opportunity for consultation with Churchill and chief Ministers.

Would be glad if you could frankly give me idea of value of visit and also ascertain from Churchill whether this is a convenient time for him. In particular I feel that clear definition where we stand in the Far East and reasonably long range policy of Middle East would enable me to plan Australian effort on man-power side more soundly. Also interested to give United Kingdom Government a clear picture of amazing munitions potential developed and developing here and to see how far greater joint use could be arranged. But as always I will be much influenced by your own opinion. Regards

MENZIES
