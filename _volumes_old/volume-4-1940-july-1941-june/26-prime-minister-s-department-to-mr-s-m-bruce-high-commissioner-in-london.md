Cablegram unnumbered 17 July 1940,

CONFIDENTIAL CODE

The allocation of wool to Japan for May has all been shipped but no release granted for June. British wool control a few weeks ago asked Central Wool Committee to suspend further shipments because of other negotiations. Matter is now becoming most embarrassing.

Japanese firms constantly pressing for resumption wool shipments and displaying annoyance at Central Wool Committee's continued inability give any reply. We cannot see necessity for further delay in matter and feel strongly that such delay will cause deterioration our trading relationships with Japan. Please press these points most strongly with United Kingdom Government and ask them agree immediate resumption normal supplies.
