Cablegram 254 21 May 1941,

IMMEDIATE

Reference D.O. Circular D.293. [1] What does expulsion of French Mission from London mean as we had no prior advice. Desire to learn attitude of United Kingdom Government to French Consuls generally as presence of Consuls here embarrassing to Free French movement and we would welcome a clear decision one way or another, not like the meaningless position adopted in regard to Danish representatives.
