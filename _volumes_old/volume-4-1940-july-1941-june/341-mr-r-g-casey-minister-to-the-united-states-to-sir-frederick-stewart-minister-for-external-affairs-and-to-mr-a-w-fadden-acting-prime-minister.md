Cablegram 183 WASHINGTON, 7 March 1941, 8.08 p.m.

SECRET FOR MINISTER AND PRIME MINISTER

In reported proposed secret session of Parliament no doubt it will be ensured that no reference is made that might compromise the Lease-Lend Bill which is in delicate final stage.

Although the warning is probably quite unnecessary I feel that I should also say that any reference that might conceivably become public regarding staff conversations or to the attitude of the United States in the Pacific should be guarded against at all costs.

CASEY
