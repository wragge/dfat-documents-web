Cablegram 99 9 August 1940,

SECRET

Your telegram No. 652. [1] Legation in China.

As you will have seen from my telegram No. 339 of 1st July to Secretary of State [2], I asked specifically for views of United Kingdom Government on this question before arriving at definite conclusion. United Kingdom Government replied in telegram No. 265 of 22nd July [3] but I did not find reply very helpful. Would appreciate therefore if you would try to obtain definite expression of United Kingdom Government's (views) on the question of whether in existing circumstances it is thought desirable to take steps in the matter.
