Cablegram 37 2 October 1940,

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

My No. 36. [1] Following is revised text of instructions which you should act upon in lieu of text in No. 36.

(Begins) Desire you advise Sautot [2] that 'Adelaide' cannot (repeat cannot) remain at Noumea indefinitely and that she will leave on fifth October. From your reports we conclude that the factor most likely to threaten the future stability of the colony is the pro Vichy elements who have been arrested interned or who have lost their positions. It is the strong opinion of the Commonwealth Government therefore that before the 'Adelaide' departs or before it becomes known that she is departing these hostile elements should be deported from the colony.

Sautot should be informed accordingly, and requested to take appropriate steps for the deportation to Sydney by the 'Pierre Loti' of persons he considers dangerous. Sydney is considered most appropriate destination in view of our information that considerable proportion of crew of 'Pierre Loti' would refuse to sail to Indo China.

Local guard should be provided and 'Pierre Loti' should sail before the departure of the 'Adelaide.' Sautot can be informed for communication to individuals concerned that on arrival at Sydney the Commonwealth Government is prepared to assume responsibility for their passage to Indo China.

Please report result your interview with Sautot along with particulars of deportees so that arrangements for their reception and subsequent transhipment can be made in Australia. (ends).
