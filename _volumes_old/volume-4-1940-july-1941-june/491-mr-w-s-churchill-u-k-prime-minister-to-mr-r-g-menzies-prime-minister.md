Cablegram Winch unnumbered LONDON, 7 June 1941

PERSONAL AND SECRET

It is all right your sending a telegram like your 344 [1] to me through the High Commissioner [2], but if it is anything purely personal I would rather it came to me direct, and there are some things I must say to you in Australia that I should not care to mention to a single soul here beyond our limited circle. I think it important we should preserve a direct channel for exceptional messages. Such messages should begin WINCH. Does this suit you? Let me know.

2\. We go into Syria tomorrow morning in considerable force. The other plan about which you know will be a little later. I cannot guarantee results about Syria as it all depends upon which way the two French cats jump. Am more hopeful of the other business. [3]

3\. I feel very much for you in all your difficulties. I cannot help being hopeful about the future. Second part of JAGUAR [4] about 50 in all, got through last night.

W. S. C[HURCHILL]
