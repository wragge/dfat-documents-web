Letter CANBERRA, 26 July 1940

SECRET

With reference to your letter of 22nd July, in regard to the proposed appointment of an Australian diplomatic representative to Tokyo [1], I am directed by the Prime Minister [2] to advise that it is the desire of the Commonwealth Government that all necessary steps be taken forthwith for the establishment of an Australian Legation and for the appointment of Sir John Latham to represent the Commonwealth. It would be appreciated also if the British Government would request the Japanese Government to make a reciprocal appointment to Canberra.

The Commonwealth Government would be grateful if the matter could be completed without delay.

F. STRAHAN
