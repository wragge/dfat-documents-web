Cablegram 28 NOUMEA, 28 September 1940, 6.30 p.m.

SECRET

Stability continues. Governor [1] states 25 gendarmes, also some noncommissioned officers and men now interned desire to adhere with [sic] him. Proposed to demobilize such men and transfer such non-commissioned officers to Tahiti.

To counteract statements of malcontent minority that recent events prelude to empire by Australia, suggest desirability of broadcasts denying this and stressing inter alia the argument that movement was French, dictated by motives of purest patriotism and therefore entirely inconsistent with Submission to any foreign power.
