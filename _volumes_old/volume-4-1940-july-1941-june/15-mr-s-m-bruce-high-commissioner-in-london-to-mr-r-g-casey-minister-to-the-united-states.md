Cablegram 33 LONDON, 6 July 1940, 2.52 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR CASEY

My telegram Number 32. [1]

Position here is one of confused thinking and apprehension of 

American reaction if agreement is made re Burma road. Nevertheless 

in my view, in [face] [2] of the Chief[s] of Staff report and the 

fact that I gathered that the Prime Minister [3] is now convinced 

that war with Japan must be avoided at all costs, there is little 

doubt they will do so.
