Windsor Castle, 24 April 1973

In another letter[1](#f1) I have set down a record of our conversation on Saturday afternoon about the matters discussed between The Queen and the Prime Minister.

You will no doubt let me know if you agree with it.

Will you also please let me know if I may inform the Canadian Government, in confidence, what was agreed about Letters of Credence and Agrèments?

The other matter we touched on was the question of communications between Australian States and the United Kingdom Government. This is a matter in which, at the present, The Queen is not and ought not to be involved. It is a matter, as I understand it, for consideration between the Commonwealth Government and the States on one hand, and the United Kingdom Government on the other. If, however, there is any question of State Premiers having direct access to The Queen, Her Majesty will be very much involved, and I think this idea should be approached with the greatest caution. I can see that there is constitutional logic in it, but there are also considerable practical difficulties and dangers. We must not allow a situation to arise in which The Queen can receive contrary advice from two different Ministers.

As you know, the principle has always been observed that, as Queen of Australia, Her Majesty has communicated exclusively with the Commonwealth Prime Minister or the Governor General, and I am sure this principle should be maintained if at all possible.

I am not, of course, saying that the alternative proposition that State Premiers should communicate direct with The Queen is unacceptable but just putting down a large marker, at this stage, that it wants watching!

It was the greatest possible pleasure seeing you both at Winchester Tower and I much look forward to our next meeting in Ottawa—I hope—or at least in Canberra in October.
