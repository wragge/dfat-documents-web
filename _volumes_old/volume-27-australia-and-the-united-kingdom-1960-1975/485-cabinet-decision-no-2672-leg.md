 **Without Submission—Privy Council Appeals—Possible Referendum**

During the course of its consideration of the Legislation Program for the 1974 Budget Sittings, the Prime Minister advised the Committee that owing to difficulties that had arisen in settling provisions acceptable to the British Prime Minister, he had formed the view that it may not be possible to proceed with the Privy Council Appeals Bills.

2\. The Prime Minister indicated that he was considering whether it might be more appropriate to settle the matter by referendum to be held at the same time as the next Senate election.
