Australia House

I told the Prime Minister of my discussion with Mr Bowen. [1](#f1)

2\. He noted that we had had a discussion rather than a negotiation and that Mr Bowen had, for the most part, spoken philosophically—though of course with firmness of view.

3\. He said he would await developments.

4\. The Prime Minister referred again to the proposal that there be a Deputy High Commissioner appointed under the Public Service Act. He said he would not accept this. He did not want it to be a place for ‘rejected Permanent Heads’. I said this never was the notion. The word ‘rejected’ was wrong. Look at the past: McCarthy, Brown, Knott and Boswell.

5\. He said, ‘Even so, we can’t have it under the Public Service Act.’

6\. I said I believed it was a wise and proper proposal, given the nature of the job to be done in London and the wide reputation in Australia House of Australian Departments.

7\. He then asked me about Mr Bowen’s attitude on the High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner reporting to the Prime Minister.

8\. I said Mr Bowen was relaxed about the appointment of the High Commissioner by the Prime Minister and/or the Cabinet, but once appointed, he wanted the High Commissioner to report to him.

9\. The Prime Minister said this would not be so. It was no use Mr Bowen trying to insist.
