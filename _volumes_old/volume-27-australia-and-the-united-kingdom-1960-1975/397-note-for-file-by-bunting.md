Canberra, 18 August 1972

Confidential

 **Australia House**

I told Sir Keith Waller that I had an hour or so last night with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. [1](#f1)

He said he was aware of this.

I said it produced no particular outcome. In a way, it could be called a philosophical discussion. But this was not to say that the Minister did not put his views strongly. He did.

I said that for my part, I was trying to find a way through. I had spent a few minutes with the Prime Minister after I left Mr Bowen and I believed there was ground on which they would come together.

Sir Keith said for his part he hoped not. He was not any more interesting himself in it and wanted no part of the exercise.

I said that my interest was to get a solution. The Minister told me that he would give the Prime Minister’s letter further consideration. He would then be replying either by a letter or orally.

Sir Keith said his understanding is that the Minister will draft a letter and will discuss it in Canberra with him on Monday.
