London, 30 October 1972

Thank you for giving me advance notice through Alec Downer of the decision you announced on 25 November [sic] about the transfer of responsibility for Australia House.[1](#f1)

I appreciate especially your statement that this decision would not change in any way the very close relationship between our two countries. I fully agree. I am also glad to know that you intend to continue to give the British High Commissioner in Canberra the right of direct access to you. I shall of course follow the same practice with your High Commissioner in London.

We shall miss Alec Downer, who has made so many friends in London, and are glad to hear that we may expect to see him here from time to time.
