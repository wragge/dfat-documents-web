Submission No. 21—the United Kingdom Government’s Commonwealth Immigrants Bill

The Cabinet agreed that Australia should not comment on the principles of this proposed legislation, but that representations should be made by the appropriate Departments through the British High Commissioner’s Office in Canberra for modification of the proposed administrative arrangements in an attempt to achieve the objectives set out in sub–paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 14 of the submission.[1](#f1) In particular, it should be suggested that the British High Commission in Australia be authorized to authorize before departure the entry of Australians into the United Kingdom.

2\. The Cabinet also authorized the Department of Labour and National Service to negotiate with the United Kingdom Ministry of Labour for the closest possible approach to automatic right of entry into the United Kingdom for Australians seeking employment in the United Kingdom, but who do not have specific jobs to go to.

3\. The Cabinet did not approve the suggestion that Australian authorities should act as agents of the United Kingdom Government to approve, or refuse, entry into the United Kingdom under the proposed legislation.
