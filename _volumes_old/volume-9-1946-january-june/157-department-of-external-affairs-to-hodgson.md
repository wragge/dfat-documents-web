Cablegram [510] [1] CANBERRA, 1 April 1946

IMMEDIATE

UNY 16.

Your 365 [2] paragraph 1. Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs. Minister desires that you should see Lie and make it clear informally that we disagree with view that positions of Assistant Secretaries General or other positions should be 'earmarked' for representatives of great powers. We are considering Australian nomination for position of Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs. Please advise. [3]
