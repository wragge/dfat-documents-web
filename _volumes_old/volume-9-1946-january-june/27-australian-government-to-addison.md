Cablegram 24 CANBERRA, 12 January 1946

SECRET

Reference my immediately preceding telegram. [1] Declaration begins:-

The Australian Government, mindful of the obligations which the Charter imposes on all members of the United Nations administering non-self-governing territories, and conscious of its responsibilities as a trustee for the peoples of the Mandated territories administered by it under the Covenant of the League of Nations, announces its intention of negotiating an appropriate Trusteeship Agreement for submission to the General Assembly with a view to bringing the Mandated Territory of New Guinea under the International Trusteeship system contemplated by Chapters 12 and 13 of the United Nations Charter. At the same time it announces a similar intention in regard to the Territory of Nauru.
