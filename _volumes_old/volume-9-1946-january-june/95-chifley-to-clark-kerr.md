Cablegram 5 CANBERRA, 18 February 1[9]46

TOP SECRET & PERSONAL

Thank you for your message which I appreciate. [1] I am doing everything possible to meet you in your difficulty. The arrival of the 'Manoora' will be unobtrusively delayed so as to occur about 12th March. In all the circumstances any further delay is unfortunately not practicable. You will readily understand that, in view of the many complications that can arise, we cannot be faced with any noticeable delays in the use of the vessel.

I sincerely trust that the above programme will prove convenient.

Meanwhile it is necessary for us to proceed on the assumption that your agreement will be forthcoming. I should like to take this opportunity of wishing you every success in your mission. [2]
