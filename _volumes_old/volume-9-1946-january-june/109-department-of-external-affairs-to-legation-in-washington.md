Cablegram 307 CANBERRA, 25 February 1946

SECRET

Your 192. [1]

Some care should be exercised before India and Philippines are added to Tribunal which is already very numerous.

1 Dispatched 21 February. It recommended Australian support for India's request to be represented on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. It noted that inclusion of India might involve extension of membership from the nine signatories of the surrender to the eleven members of the F.E.C., and that any Philippines claim should also be supported.

2 Indian claims were supported by the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and both India and the Philippines were represented on the tribunal.
