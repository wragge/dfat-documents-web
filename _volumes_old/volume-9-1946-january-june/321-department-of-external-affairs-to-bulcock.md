IMMEDIATE

F.A.0. and I.E.F.C.

1\. Approval given our seeking membership Central Committee. [1] It is proposed Garside be our nominee but this to be confirmed.

2\. We should definitely have seats on Committees for Dairy Products, Fats and Oils, Meat and Meat products, Sugar, Dried and Canned Fruits, also those that we were on previously including those in London. [2] We are not particular about rice, but if it is suggested we take membership, we would not object.

4\. Consideration is being given provision of extra staff for Washington.
