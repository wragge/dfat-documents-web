Cablegram 1410 CANBERRA, 3 October 1946

IMMEDIATE SECRET

JAPANESE WHALING

Position as disclosed in F.E.C.239 [1] and 242 [2] is most unsatisfactory. I understand you were absent from Washington when my telegram 1326 [3] arrived. Please take up matter again personally with State Department emphasizing its importance to Australia and unsatisfactory nature of their reply. You should indicate that Australia may find it necessary to raise the matter in F.E.C. and/or Allied Council for Japan.

Assume you are in close touch with New Zealand and United Kingdom representatives.
