Cablegram [UNY]367 CANBERRA, 18 November 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your UN714. [1] Veto.

1\. Procedure suggested is merely attempt by Big Five to outmanoeuvre Australia and others urging effective Assembly action. There should be no adjournment whatsoever until Assembly has debated and voted on Australian and other proposals. It is after that that Big Five should consider their position. The matter is one for Assembly and not self-constituted Big Five.

2\. You should be in a position to move Australian resolution if you have not already done so (this is not clear from your reports) and press to vote provided you have necessary support. The important arguments above concerning position of Assembly in relation to Big Five should assist you in obtaining support.
