Cablegram UN158 NEW YORK, 2 March 1949, 4.16 p.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

Your telegram 123. [1]

1\. The Commission's report [2] was circulated only this morning and have not yet had time for useful discussion with council members. Hope to report further tomorrow if necessary by telephone.

2\. President [3] of Council (now Cuba) has taken no steps to convene a meeting on Indonesia but at tomorrow's meeting on other matters will ascertain the wish of members of the Council. I doubt whether in the circumstances a meeting will be possible before early next week.

3\. The position is certainly most difficult. With regard to the suggestion in the latter part of paragraph 2 of your 123, I have personally thought for some time that the only way out might eventually prove to be a decision by the Council to convene a conference of parties in New York as nearly as possible under the direct auspices of the Council. This, however, raises some awkward questions of jurisdiction.
