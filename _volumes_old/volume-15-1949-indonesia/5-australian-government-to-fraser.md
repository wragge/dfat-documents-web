Cablegram 1 CANBERRA, 3 January 1949, 10.15 a.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

We have received advice of invitation to Australia and New Zealand from Nehru to attend conference in New Delhi on January 16th to discuss Indonesia. Invitation implies that aim of conference is not to act outside the United Nations but to assist the Security Council in discussing the matter. Our first view is that logically we must accept invitation and moreover cannot afford not to accept an invitation to join in an Asiatic Conference, the first of its kind.

Our presence along with yours could probably ensure constructive action and avoidance of purely negative unilateral approach.

No final decision is taken but would be glad of your immediate comments.
