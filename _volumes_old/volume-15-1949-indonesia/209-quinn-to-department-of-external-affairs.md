Cablegram Hag20 THE HAGUE, 12 February 1949, 1.34 p.m.

Following is English text of official communique published on 11th February.

Minister Sassen has submitted his resignation to Her Majesty The Queen, as Minister for Overseas Territories. No fundamental differences have arisen within the Cabinet on the Constitutional aims concerning the reforms in Indonesia. The aims of the Government as they have been repeatedly made known will, therefore, be followed unchanged and as far as this depends on the Government will be realised at short notice. While also the whole Cabinet wished to adhere to the statement [1] of Dr. J. H. van Royen made in the Security Council on behalf of the Government on 28th January last a difference of opinion arose between the other members of the Cabinet and Minister Sassen on the actual policy to be conducted in this matter.
