Cablegram K282 BATAVIA, 5 March 1949, 5.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

My telegram K281. [1]

B.F.O. this morning, March 5th, failed to reach a decision and adjourned till March 10th. There is therefore no possibility of representatives visiting Bangka before March 11th. It appears at least Hamid (West Borneo) Mansoor (East Sumatra) and Malik (South Sumatra) are holding out for invalidation of Thursday's resolution.
