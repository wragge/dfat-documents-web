Cablegram 50 CANBERRA, 26 January 1949, 8.55 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

Indonesia It was announced on the air that meeting has adjourned and that Egypt and others will not support United States Resolution [1] as it does not go far enough.

I have discussed position with the Minister and his main concern as previous telegram [2] indicated is to secure a positive vote.

If there now appears to be support for Delhi resolution [3] the further you can go towards it with the hope of a positive vote the better.

Much will depend on how far the United States is prepared to move towards Delhi resolution.

The important thing is not to show any weakening on the Delhi resolution to which, already, according to press reports, American public opinion is reacting favourably.
