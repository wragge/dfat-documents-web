Cablegram 128 NEW DELHI, 16 February 1949, 6.55 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

Indonesia. Bajpai yesterday expressed to us the opinion that India and Australia should adopt a common line before the Security Council if the Commission should have to report back to it. Asked to elucidate this, he felt that there should be resistance to any attempt by the Dutch to present the Council with any solution of their own which amounts to side-stepping of the resolution [1] of January 28th. He considers any further action by Asian countries, based on Delhi conference, should await outcome of the Security Council meeting.
