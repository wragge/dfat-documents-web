Cablegram 228 NEW DELHI, 28 March 1949, 7.40 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Our 227. [1]

My Dear High Commissioner. Reference your visit this morning. I attach a paraphrase of a telegram which we sent to our representative in New York, on March 22nd. As you will see, he has already been instructed to get in touch with your representative Mr. Hood to get support for including Indonesia in the Agenda of the adjourned session of the Assembly. Since we have convened the New Delhi conference, I have requested Mr. B. R. Sen to take the initiative. However, as I told you this morning, this is just a formality. What we are anxious to secure is co-operative and effective action.

G. S. Bajpai.
