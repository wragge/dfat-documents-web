Cablegram 84 CANBERRA, 12 May 1949, 12,15 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Your No. 74. [1]

It is not clear whether the suggestion is there should be loaned from the public administration a suitable officer or whether it is desired we recommend to the Republicans a person whom we regard as being suitable. It seems to us that it would be in the best interests of the Republicans for them to appoint a person whom we might recommend rather than to have on loan from us an officer of the Commonwealth public administration as this might be open to criticisms by Republican supporters.

Please advise. Meanwhile we are getting into touch with likely persons.

1 Dispatched on 11 May, it reported Hatta's request to the Australian Government for the loan of an experienced officer to assist and advise the Indonesian Republic on economic problems (see Document 377).
