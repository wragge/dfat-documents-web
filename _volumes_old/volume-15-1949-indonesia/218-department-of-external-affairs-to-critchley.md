Cablegram 29 CANBERRA, 15 February 1949, 5.30 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

Under Commission's terms of reference which provide for majority decision it will serve no purpose to maintain minority position.

Your object should be to press Cochran as far as you can in the direction of a strong report and join him in majority. We are not impressed with his argument [1] regarding adverse effect of Dutch Cabinet crisis on Commission's work in Indonesia.
