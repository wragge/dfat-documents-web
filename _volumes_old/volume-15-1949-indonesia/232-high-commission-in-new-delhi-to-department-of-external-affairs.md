Cablegram 135 NEW DELHI, 19 February 1949, 3.38 p.m.

SECRET

Your telegram 80. [1] The Indonesians have been to see Bajpai.

Their attitude is to mark time and to let the Dutch fully disclose their hand. They claim that they have nothing to lose by doing this and that actually their case will thereby be strengthened when the Security Council again has to deal with the matter.

Bajpai intends to be guided by this attitude. He says that the Indian Government will take no positive action for the time being.

 _

1 Dispatched on 18 February, it asked the High Commission in New Delhi to confirm wheather Bajpai was content to await the UN Commission for Indonesia's assessment of the Dutch reaction to the Security Council resolution of 28 January (Document 168).
