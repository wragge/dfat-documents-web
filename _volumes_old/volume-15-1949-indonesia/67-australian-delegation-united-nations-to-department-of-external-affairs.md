Cablegram UN8 NEW YORK, 11 January 1949, 9.27 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

Opening of Council meeting today [1] Jessup made very satisfactory statement which was apparently partly result of his discussions with Cochran. He made clear condemnation of Dutch non-compliance with December Resolutions [2] and stated that only possible course for Council now was to stipulate dates for elections for Constituent Assembly and for assumption of sovereignty by U.N.I.

These should be 'Matter of months'.

Progressive withdrawal of Dutch Forces should, meanwhile, be effected to be complete from whole of Indonesia by final date.

Whole process to be under United Nations supervision.

2\. China and Norway spoke on same lines.

3\. Full report follows.

4\. From private discussions there seems good prospect for Resolution including above main points. Cuba is favourably inclined. United Kingdom informed us their latest instructions were moving also in this direction.

5\. We expect to confer with India and United States tomorrow with view to formulation of preliminary draft and will keep you informed. Council meets again Friday.
