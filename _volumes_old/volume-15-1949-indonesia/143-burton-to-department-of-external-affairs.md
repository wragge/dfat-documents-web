Cablegram 73 NEW DELHI, 22 January 1949, 11.55 p.m.

IMMEDIATE

Asian Conference.

We have still not received telegram referred to in your 41 [1] but our immediately following telegram transmits the text of three resolutions agreed to at closed session this afternoon. Plenary session will be held 0930 hours to-morrow morning when resolutions will be presented. There are many drafting changes and some changes in the substance which are improvement from our point of view. The first resolution will also be forwarded by cable to Secretary-General of the United Nations together with covering letter which includes inter alia reference to the fact that the Security Council acts on behalf of all members.

The question of reference to the Assembly is now included in the first resolution.

All reference in the second resolution to other matters than Indonesia and to Secretariat are deleted. A third resolution merely suggesting that Governments explore among themselves, having regard to the areas concerned, the question of regional consideration was finally adopted. Thus the establishment of machinery has been avoided.
