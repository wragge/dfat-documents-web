Following is text of telegram [1] despatched by Commission today 26th March to Security Council.

Begins- Commission acknowledges receipt of telegram dated 23rd March, 1949, from President of Security Council to Chairman of Commission requesting report on alleged damage in city of Jogjakarta. [2]

On basis of information available to it from its military observers and from its deputy representatives who visited Jogjakarta on 21st March, Commission has honour to report- (1) There is no serious damage to city of Jogjakarta which would interfere in any way with re-establishment of Republican Government in Jogjakarta.

(2) However, lack of materials and equipment part of which has been removed or destroyed since 18th September, 1948, will seriously hamper effective functioning of Republican administration.

It will therefore be necessary for Netherlands authorities to furnish necessary facilities as anticipated in paragraph 2 of operative part of Security Council's resolution [3] of 28th January, 1949.

Ends.
