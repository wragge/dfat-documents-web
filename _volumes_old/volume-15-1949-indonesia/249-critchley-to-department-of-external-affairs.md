Cablegram unnumbered BATAVIA, 26 February 1949, 5.20 p.m.

IMPORTANT

Following is official translation of communique to be released today at 1800 hours.

'In communique of Wednesday, 23rd February, 1949, Netherlands Government announced that important conclusions had been reached between this Government and High Representative of Crown at Batavia concerning policy to be pursued with regard to Indonesia.

Netherlands Government is convinced that in order to reach satisfactory solution of pending problems, an accelerated transfer of its sovereignty over Indonesia to Representative Federal Government is indicated.

Netherlands Government has, therefore, decided to endeavour to effectuate this transfer considerably earlier than at date of July first, 1950, which, in accordance with previous plans of Netherlands Government, has been laid down in resolution [1] of Security Council of January 28th, 1949, as ultimate date for transfer of sovereignty.

It is clear that achievement of this endeavour along most desirable lines requires sincere and energetic co-operation of all parties concerned. Netherlands Government is of opinion that common purpose, eagerly aimed at, justifies confidence that all parties will show their readiness to co-operate.

In desire to facilitate a prompt beginning of discussions for speedy creation of sovereign United States of Indonesia and in order to fulfil terms of resolution of Security Council on this point, Netherlands Government has decided to lift remaining restrictions on liberty of movement of Republican leaders and to consult with them concerning their wishes as to their future residence and arrangements which will have to be made in this respect.

For furtherance of effective discussions, Netherlands Government has decided to take initiative for convocation of Round Table Conference, The Hague, at earliest date, that is on March 12th, 1949. Purpose of this conference will be to discuss conditions for and ways along which earliest possible transfer of Sovereignty as indicated above could be effectuated, simultaneous establishment of Netherlands-Indonesian Union and arrangements for intermediary period, including creation of Federal Interim Government, these provisions being considered in their relation to accelerated transfer of sovereignty.

Netherlands Government is prepared to consider, together with parties concerned, merits of any proposed solution put forward at Conference by any of parties and to examine in how far it is compatible with its responsibility. In accordance with this purpose, Netherlands Government has extended invitations for Round Table Conference to all parties concerned. United Nations Commission for Indonesia has been informed that Netherlands Government will welcome Committees presence at this Conference in order to enable it to render its assistance.'
