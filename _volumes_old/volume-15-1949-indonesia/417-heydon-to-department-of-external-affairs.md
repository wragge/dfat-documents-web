CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

Have spoken informally as instructed to United Kingdom Officials.

Their own information from Batavia seems to confirm Critchley's views on Spoor's activities and they think The Hague Conference should take place before August if recent progress is to be maintained and they see danger in delay in return to Djogjakarta though evacuation programme of 30,000 who wish to leave the city is a real problem. According to their information, Military sources are somewhat exaggerating the present conflicts between various groups in and around Djogjakarta and they think that, on the whole, the Dutch civilians are anxious for arrangements preparatory to the conference at The Hague to proceed quickly. In the opinion of the United Kingdom officials, Lovink will have powers to override Spoor in the inevitable clash between them.
