Your 87 [1] to Washington. Repeated here as 39.

Canadian authorities indicate unofficially that line of policy in Council is not yet fixed and that Canada prefers to await report of Commission under proviso to Clause 3 of resolution [2] of 28th January before defining its position. They note that Council is unlikely to reach the matter on 13th February owing to state of agenda and that, in the meantime, Cabinet change in Netherlands may be caused by resignation of Minister of Overseas Territories.
