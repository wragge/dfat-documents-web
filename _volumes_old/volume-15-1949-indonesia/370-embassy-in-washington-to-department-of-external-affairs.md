Cablegram 364 WASHINGTON, 20 April 1949, 8.11 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Indonesia.

Yesterday 23 Republican Senators requested the President to take steps through the United Nations to enforce the United Nations decisions in the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

The request arose out of recent Senate Debate on E.R.P. when compromise resolution on Netherlands was reached. The request contains statement that 'in the debate it was the overwhelming expression of the Senate that the Netherlands Government has acted improperly and against the interest of world peace and security in the employment of Military Force in Indonesia and in the consistent refusal to comply with the Security Council resolutions [1] calling for cessation of hostilities and other steps for peaceful settlement of the dispute in Indonesia'.
