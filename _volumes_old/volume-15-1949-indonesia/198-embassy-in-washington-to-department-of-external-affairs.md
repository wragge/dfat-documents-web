Cablegram 105 WASHINGTON, 7 February 1949, 8.24 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

United States still do not appear to have any clear idea as to action which should be taken by United Nations Commission. State Department officials seem to be adopting a 'wait and see' attitude pending (a) Cochran's report [1] from The Hague and Brussels, and (b) Official Dutch reaction.

State Department publicly denied last week that United States was marking time on Security Council Resolution [2] to enable Dutch to take different and unilateral action. Department officials assured us again today that purpose of Cochran's visit to The Hague and Brussels was purely to ascertain the extent to which the Dutch would comply with United Nations Directive, and to enlist Spaak's influence.
