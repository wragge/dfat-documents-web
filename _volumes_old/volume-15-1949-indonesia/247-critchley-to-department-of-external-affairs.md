Cablegram K274 BATAVIA, 26 February 1949, 9.15 p.m.

IMPORTANT

Netherlands policy on Indonesia as announced today rejects by implication the Security Council resolution [1] and proposes in its place only the calling of a round table conference to start 12th March at The Hague.

2\. Invitation to appoint delegations to participate in this conference have been sent to Sukarno and to the Sultan Hamid chairman of the B.F.O. The Netherlands Government will also invite representatives of the provisional Federal Government and minorities. The commission has been invited to attend the Conference 'so that it can render assistance to achieve positive results'.

3\. I shall report reactions as soon as possible and meanwhile continue to press for a strong report to the Security Council on the Netherlands non-compliance with the resolution.
