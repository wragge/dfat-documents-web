Cablegram 228 LONDON, 19 February 1942, 1.45 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister.

Following is extract from personal telegram from Field Marshal Dill [1] which has just been received by Chiefs of Staff.

Extract begins:

1\. General Marshall [2] informs me that a (corrupt group) division and some base troops leaving America for Australia early March. In these circumstances would it not be wise to leave destination of 6th and 9th Australian Divisions open. More troops might be badly needed in Burma. 2. I do not know whether Commonwealth Government would be prepared to give up one of their own divisions in exchange for an American division. Extract ends.

Would be grateful for your views.
