Cablegram 235 LONDON, 21 February 1942, 1.25 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

My telegram of 20th February No. 233. [1]

Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister. [2]

I have received the following telegram from President of United States. Begins.

I hope you can persuade Australian Government to allow proposed temporary diversion of their leading Australian Division to Burma.

I think this of utmost importance. Tell them I am speeding additional troops as well as planes to Australia and that my estimate of the situation there is highly optimistic and by no means dark. Roosevelt. Ends.
