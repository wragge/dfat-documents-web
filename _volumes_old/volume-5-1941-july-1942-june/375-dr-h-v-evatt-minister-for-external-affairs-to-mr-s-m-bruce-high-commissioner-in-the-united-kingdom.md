Cablegram S[L] [1] 1 (extract) CANBERRA, n.d.

MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL FOR BRUCE TO BE DECYPHERED BY STIRLING [2]

[matter omitted]

2\. May I point out confidentially how embarrassing it is for the Government to have our decisions over A.I.F. ignored and to send [3] further request upon the same topic. You are (however) out of touch with home defence position here and that is necessarily a controlling factor. I have already wired to Cripps [4] as to the matter and greatly fear that if matter goes further damage may be done to the best interests of the Empire.

If I may say so Page [5] seems to have acted in (direct) opposition to his instructions and matters can hardly continue in this way.

3\. I am obliged to you for your assistance over the Lend-Lease Agreement where intervention seems to have had some effect. [6]

EVATT
