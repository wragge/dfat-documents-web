1 Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton.

2 War Cabinet considered this cablegram on 8 December and agreed 'that the situation should be accepted as involving a state of war against Japan'. See AA:A2673, vol. 9, minute 1557 and Documents 172 and 174.

Shortly before 1 p.m. on 8 December a cablegram (no. 1098 on file AA:A1608,J39/2/1)was received from R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, advising that Japanese aircraft had bombed Hawaii and Manila and that although the U.S. Congress had not yet formally declared war the situation was 'indistinguishable' from war.
