Cablegram 1079 [1] CANBERRA, 16 December 1941

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Your 1148. [2] I want you to press and insist that in every conference between representatives of Associated Powers this Government must have the opportunity of separate representation even though it may appear Impracticable at first sight.

Your particular message shows danger that our own point of view may be regarded as of subsidiary importance. On the contrary our point of view must be continuously stressed or our great needs will be overlooked. It is obvious that in some respects the views of United Kingdom representatives will differ from our own both in relation to supplies and forces. This Government is far from satisfied with the results of the policy of subordinating our requirements to those of others. [The result of such policy is that this country's defences have been largely neglected.] [3]

EVATT
