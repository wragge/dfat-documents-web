Cablegram E11 WASHINGTON, 1 November 1945, 12.50 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Byrnes announced yesterday a four power agreement (America, Britain, Russia, China) to destroy major remnants of the Japanese Navy and divide equally 38 destroyers and additional smaller craft. You know how keenly I am concerned in this, both from the point of view of principle and actual recovery in kind of part of our losses. Has the Australian Government been consulted at any time by the United Kingdom or any other Government and if so what reply or agreement was made. Please reply most urgently.
