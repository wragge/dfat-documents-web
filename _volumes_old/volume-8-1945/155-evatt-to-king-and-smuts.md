Cablegrams 320, 79 CANBERRA, 4 August 1945

SECRET PERSONAL

For your private information, I am repeating cablegrams sent to the Dominions Office during the course of the Potsdam Conference.

[1] I hope that as soon as possible you will favour me with your personal views and any suggestions you may have to meet what seems to be an unsatisfactory situation.

 _1 i.e. Documents 141 and 149._
