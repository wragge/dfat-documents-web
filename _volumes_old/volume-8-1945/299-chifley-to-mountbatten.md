Cablegram unnumbered CANBERRA, 10 October 1945

SECRET

I have your personal telegram [1] and the matter received my immediate consideration.

No crews available for Dutch ships owing to Indonesian seamen's strike. Dutch ship VAN SPEZAAK fully loaded with mercy cargo ready for sailing since 24th September is still in Sydney Harbour.

To overcome deadlock suggest you convey to Lieut. General Van Mook desirability of chartering Dutch ships to Australian Government to ensure early despatch all ships carrying mercy cargo.
