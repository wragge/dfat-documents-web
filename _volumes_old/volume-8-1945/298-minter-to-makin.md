Letter CANBERRA, 8 October 1945

Under instructions from my Government I have the honor to advise you that the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China have agreed to the establishment of a Far Eastern Advisory Commission for the consideration of political matters connected with the fulfilment by Japan of its obligations under the instrument of surrender. It is the desire of these governments that the Commission include representatives of certain other states which have actively participated in the war against Japan and which are principally interested in the area of the Western Pacific. A cordial invitation is extended to the Government of Australia to participate in the Commission. [1]
