Cablegram E23 WASHINGTON, 10 November 1945, 6.56 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Far Eastern Commission.

The latest position is that the Russians have proposed Four-Power Body in Japan which would be a Control Council and in which, in effect, veto would apply even to directives from the Far Eastern Commission. As regards the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, Russians demand majority voting including Four-Power Unanimity and Russians object to the proposal in draft terms of reference that [1] directives could be issued by the States without consultation.

In other words Russia, in each case, demands single power veto.

The effect of these proposals would be not only to withdraw from the United States primary responsibility on matters concerning the occupation of Japan but also to introduce a veto system which might easily paralyze the occupation policy and cause chaos.

In the meantime we are continuing to establish the Far Eastern Commission as a real working and planning body and no doubt it will continue to function.
