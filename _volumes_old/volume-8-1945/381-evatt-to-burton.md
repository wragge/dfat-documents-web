Cablegram E24 WASHINGTON, 9 November 1945, 10.04 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 1684 [1], my view is that Macmahon Ball should be brought immediately into continuous consultation on all matters affecting Indonesia because of our vital concern in the area and the part we played in its defence and liberation.

Request should be made simultaneously to Mountbatten and the United Kingdom Government.
