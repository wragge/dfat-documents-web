We regard Russian and American adherence to world organisation at earliest possible moment as vital. Further we would wish not to be bound to any cut and dried scheme before a general conference. In other words there must be maximum participation by powers other than Big Three in shaping details and procedure of organisation. This I think is in line with the recent analysis of Dumbarton Oaks draft which we made at Wellington.

I would appreciate the views of your Prime Minister before preparing reply to Dominions Office. [2]
