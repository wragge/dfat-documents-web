Cablegram SAC26178 COLOMBO, 22 October 1945, 11.25 p.m.

SECRET

Your 212246. [1]

As this matter appears to be a conflict of views on governmental level I am referring it to Mr. Attlee. I request that you will not allow ESPERENCE BAY to enter any port in Java or Sumatra until a decision has been reached.
