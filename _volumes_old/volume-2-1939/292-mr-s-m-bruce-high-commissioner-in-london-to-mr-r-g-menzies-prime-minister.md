Cablegram 556 (extract) LONDON, 13 October 1939, 6.36 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Information received today points to German Government interpreting the Prime Minister's statement [1] as closing the door and as expressed from one source that the war has now begun.

If accurate, reactions are contrary to War Cabinet's anticipation, but position very obscure.
