Minute FC10 CANBERRA, 28 November 1939

DESPATCH or 6TH DIVISION OVERSEAS

The following decisions were taken by the Full Cabinet:-

(i) The 6th Division, which was raised for service at home or abroad as occasion required, can be permitted to proceed overseas when it has reached a suitable stage in its training, which it is anticipated will be early in the new year.

(ii) The Government is averse to shipment of artillery or any other material needed for the maintenance of the Militia Forces unless it is capable of rapid replacement.

(iii) In view of the reasons which decided the reversal of the decision to despatch the Air Expeditionary Force, the despatch of an Army Co-operation Squadron was not approved.
