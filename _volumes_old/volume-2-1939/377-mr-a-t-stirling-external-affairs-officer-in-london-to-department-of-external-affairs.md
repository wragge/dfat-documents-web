MOST SECRET

Timor.

Reference my telegram 639. [1] Now established that Comparhia Ultramarina de Petroleos is a Portuguese company set up by Oil Concessions Limited. You will doubtless have been advised direct from Lisbon [2] of the Portuguese decree of 27th October authorising Minister of Colonies [3] to grant concession to this company.
