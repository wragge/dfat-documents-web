Cablegram unnumbered (extract) LONDON, 29 September 1939

MOST SECRET PERSONAL

Your telegram yesterday's date-WASHINGTON [1]-am further considering matter and will advise you as soon as possible. VISIT OF MINISTER-British Government would prefer delay of a few days in hope that concurrent announcements can be made from other Dominions. This should only involve delay until Monday or Tuesday [2] but if you desire announce earlier I do not anticipate any difficulty in removing objections if you so advise.

BRUCE
