Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 3 October 1939, 4.01 p.m.

IMMEDIATE PERSONAL HIMSELF MOST SECRET

Notwithstanding most anxious thought am unable to convince Myself that any usefulness I may have been is not better employed in London than Washington. Recognize however it is for you to determine where I shall be used. My only desire is to render whatever service I can wherever it will be most valuable. I suggest the matter remain in abeyance until we get through the present critical week when I will cable you again fully.
