Minute 181 CANBERRA, 5 September 1939

EXCHANGE OF HIGH COMMISSIONERS

A cablegram from the Prime Minister of Canada [1] was read by Mr Menzies [2], in which an immediate exchange of High Commissioners between Ottawa and Canberra was suggested. It was resolved that the Government of Canada be informed that Australia cordially concurs in the proposal.

It was further resolved that negotiations should be opened with the Prime Minister of South Africa and the Prime Minister of New Zealand for the reciprocal exchange of High Commissioners with this country. [3]
