Cablegram unnumbered 19 September 1939,

SECRET

We have been considering the possibilities in relation to Russia, and while we recognise that information is so meagre that we are not really competent to form a concluded opinion, our impression is very strongly that nothing should be done to cut off diplomatic relations with Russia at present. It seems to us quite possible that though Germany and Russia now appear to be dividing the Polish spoil, they may yet quarrel over the division.
