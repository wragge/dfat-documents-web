Cablegram unnumbered 1 June 1939,

Your telegram of 31st May. [1]

The area of old Staughton concessions approximately 2,500 acres only, far too small for exploitation and development of an oil field, and which proved in past one of main obstacles to formation of company with sufficient capital to operate.

Would be glad if representations could be made for largest concession possible.

Oil Concessions now inform me their own shareholders are able subscribe 20,000 new capital and have several assurances from other interests that requisite capital would be forthcoming as soon as company obtains concession.
