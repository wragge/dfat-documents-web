Circular Cablegram D113 LONDON, 4 December 1939, 9.50 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Interim reply to French Government on War Aims. We feel that the amendment to paragraph 7 suggested in New Zealand telegram 224 of 28th November is an improvement and we propose to adopt it. [1] It seems to us however that the amendment to paragraph 4 would affect the sense and that the word 'voluntarily' sufficiently implies the idea of negotiation. We think it preferable therefore to retain the original wording.

In the absence of further comments we propose to despatch the reply as amended to the French Government on Friday next, 8th December.
