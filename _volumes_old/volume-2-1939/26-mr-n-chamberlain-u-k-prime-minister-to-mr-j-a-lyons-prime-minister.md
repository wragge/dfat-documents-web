Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 16 February 1939, 9.48 p.m.

PERSONAL SECRET

I am much obliged for your telegram of 14th February. [1] I greatly appreciate the close attention with which His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions are following the discussions on Palestine, and arrangements are being made for communicating to your, and to other British Commonwealth Governments, periodic reports of their progress. As you will have seen from the first of these telegrams [2] discussion on preliminary statements made by the Arab and Jewish delegates is still proceeding.

I can assure you that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are fully alive to the considerations to which you have drawn attention in your telegram, and you may be certain that in our negotiations we shall bear them constantly in mind.
