Circular Cablegram D54 LONDON, 27 October 1939, 6.02 p.m.

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

My Circular telegram D.52 [1]: Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister [2] :-

We are at present considering the question of reply to be returned to the French Government in response to their approach on the subject of war aims. As soon as a draft has been prepared we will communicate it to you so as to afford opportunity to you to make any observations you may think desirable.

In the meantime I should welcome any preliminary expression of views on the matter which you may care to make. We and the French Government are agreed in thinking that if the correspondence should result in sonic public declaration, such declaration should be in quite general terms.
