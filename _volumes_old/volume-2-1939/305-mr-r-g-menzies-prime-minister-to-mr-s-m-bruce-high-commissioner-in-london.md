Cablegram unnumbered 23 October 1939,

Central Wool Committee is most anxious receive advice regarding sales to neutrals. Japan negotiating closely. American interests are becoming most critical and are stressing necessity quoting merino. Delay causing considerable political and other difficulty.

Same remarks apply sheep skins where some local interests, you may guess at, are making trouble. My impression is that British Government too much advised by departmental people and too little by technical wool men. Your own efforts are much appreciated but I cannot over stress urgency of enabling us to get ahead.

MENZIES
