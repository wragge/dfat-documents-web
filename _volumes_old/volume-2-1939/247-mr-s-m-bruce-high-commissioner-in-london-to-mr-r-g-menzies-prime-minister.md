Cablegram 499 LONDON, 26 September 1939, 5.59 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Strong feeling that in the near future Hitler [1] will attempt a strong peace offensive; even being suggested that he might indicate preparedness to resign in Goering's [2] favour if this would assist the re-establishment of peace. This suggestion probably nonsense but in my view he will go almost any length to create the impression that continuance of the war is unnecessary.

Delay involved in this manoeuvre renders attack on the Western Front unlikely before the winter but intensive air offensive would be substituted.

BRUCE
