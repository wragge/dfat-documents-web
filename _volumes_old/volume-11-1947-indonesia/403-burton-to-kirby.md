Cablegram 326 CANBERRA, 3 November 1947

SECRET PERSONAL

Glad to know, for the information of the Prime Minister in particular, whether, following first contacts with the Republican and Netherlands authorities, the Committee's future programme has become clear enough to enable you to give any indication of when your work will be completed. As you are aware, the Prime Minister is anxious for your return as soon as possible. I should also mention that there are signs of impatience with the Security Council members to have the Committee complete its investigation and report with the minimum possible delay.

Is there any chance that the Committee can shorten the preliminary discussions on procedure and choice of meeting place and get going on the substance with a view to producing the final report and recommendations in two weeks?
