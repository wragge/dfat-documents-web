Cablegram 197 CANBERRA, 28 July 1947, 4.45 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Thank you for your message on Indonesia. [1] I am informing Attlee that we feel matter must be referred to the Security Council. [2] If there is no immediate chance of settlement, we would propose to refer it with the idea that an immediate recommendation be made that both parties should observe Article 17 of the Linggadjati Agreement which calls for arbitration by a third party.
