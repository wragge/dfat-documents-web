Cablegram 332 CANBERRA, 7 November 1947, 1.45 p.m.

SECRET

Djokjakarta Radio accuses Dutch of having sent planes to strafe population of Bandjarnegora, in Central Java, on 30th October and 4th November, killing seven civilians and injuring others.

Challenge which these attacks constitute to latest Security Council resolution has been pointed out by General Soedirman. [1] Dutch apparently claim these measures were taken in retaliation against killing of four Dutch soldiers by land-mine allegedly fired by Republican Army personnel.

2\. Such incidents as these are in our view direct challenge to authority of your Committee, and seem to call for investigation and vigorous protest. What is Committee doing?
