Letter SYDNEY, 26 March 1947

Now that the agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the Netherlands has been signed by both Governments, I desire to officially present to you at your earliest convenience my credentials as Indonesian Trade Commissioner in Australia.

Needless to say I have not been idle in attending to all those things that would provide for a prompt opening up of trade relations in anticipation of the signing of the agreement.

Having in mind the intensity to which certain other countries are planning their trade relations with Indonesia, I fear Australia will be placed at a very distinct disadvantage in this very valuable market if positive steps are not taken quickly.

At the present time, the advantage is with Australia. Politically, Australian stock is high in Indonesia. Secondly, the reciprocal trade is such that it dovetails ideally into Australian economy, and thirdly, the market is at our back door.

I conclude by stressing that prompt action would be of extreme value.
