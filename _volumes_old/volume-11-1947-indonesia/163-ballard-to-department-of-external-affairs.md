Cablegram 249 BATAVIA, 25 July 1947, 6.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your telegram 203. [1]

1\. Immediately asked the Dutch for facilities to make reply over radio as the Dutch radio is the only means available and consequently showed them the text proposed.

They object to making of reply as well as the text, especially to second sentence, and have referred the matter to The Hague.

If you thought fit you might have it broadcast over Radio Australia in the Indonesian Session.

Is there any objection to my informing Jenkins of the text of the reply and that facilities were not given?
