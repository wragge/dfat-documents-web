Cablegram unnumbered HMAS HOBART, 3 August 1947, 3.59 a.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

Indonesia. [1]

The Security Council should retain general jurisdiction without prejudice to the matter being raised in the Assembly under the Assembly's security powers.

2\. Australia should be included in any formula for mediation or arbitration. I have no doubt that Indonesia will insist on this because of our initiative and danger of the Security Council being side-tracked.

3\. I agree that it is important in Australia's interests that we must carefully watch and I doubt whether one man can continue to represent us to both parties as at present.
