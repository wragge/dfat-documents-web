Cablegram 1057 WASHINGTON, 6 August 1947, 5.50 p.m.

IMMEDIATE

Indonesia.

1\. Marshall stated to press men today that United States is prepared to send mediators to Java if both parties agree. He added that United States had laid down no conditions such as withdrawal to positions held before outbreak of fighting. He disclaimed knowledge of report that Leahy would lead mission of mediation. He also observed that in offering mediation outside United Nations, United States had to consider the precedent thus established but declined to say whether U.S.A. would similarly umpire other disputes.

2\. Sjahrir expected in New York possibly today.
