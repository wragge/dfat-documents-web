Cablegram 44 CANBERRA, 17 April 1947, 5.50 p.m.

Your appeals to meet the Dutch [2] imply to our mind that you do not fully appreciate our feelings in this matter and may not have conveyed them to the Dutch authorities. We had hoped that your previous telegram [3] stating there was no objection to unostentatious visit was a hopeful sign of early agreement. Both the matter of the visit and of the repatriation of Indonesians should be pressed.
