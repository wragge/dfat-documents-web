Cablegram 312 LONDON, 1 August 1947, 6.15 p.m.

SECRET

On receipt of your telegram 274 [1] yesterday afternoon I immediately spoke to Addison, who promised to have your request considered straight away. I have just received his reply.

2\. 'The United Kingdom Government much appreciate Australia's wish to use Lord Killearn's services. Unfortunately, however, his duties as Special Commissioner for South East Asia are at the moment very pressing in view of his long absence from Singapore earlier this year and of the social welfare conference which he has summoned for this month. [2] It is regretted therefore that the United Kingdom Government does not feel that it can spare Killearn for the purpose suggested.'
