Cablegram 336 CANBERRA, 10 November 1947, 5.05 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Military Advisers.

Question of return of Dyke and Spence [1] taken up with Defence authorities. Dyke has important work here as Director of Artillery, and it is at present proposed that he should proceed to the United Kingdom in January for a conference connected with that work. We can give no convincing reason why his programme should be changed as it seems to us that reports of military observers are complete and Committee deliberations cannot be assisted [by] further investigations. Time has arrived when decision and action and not investigation is required, and in so far as military advice is required Campbell and Chesterman should suffice. If you can give us convincing case we would endeavour to obtain Defence concurrence. [2]

2 On 22 November, Kirby renewed his request for additional military advisers (one to replace Campbell who was to return to Australia at the end of the month). On 27 November, the Department of Defence informed the Department of External Affairs that two officers (Brigadier E. M. Neylan and Squadron Leader L. N. Kroll) would be made available. Neylan and Kroll flew to Java in early December.
