Cablegram 290 CANBERRA, 31 July 1947

MOST IMMEDIATE

Security Council discussion will take place within the next 12 hours and so far we are not aware of any declaration by Indonesian Republic that they will carry out obligations of the Charter. The absence of the declaration will prejudice the whole case.

Please advise by most immediate.
