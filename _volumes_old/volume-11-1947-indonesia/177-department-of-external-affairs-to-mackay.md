Cablegram 282 CANBERRA, 29 July 1947

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your 397. [1] While appreciating your administrative difficulties delay in report has placed us in embarrassing position as previous advice was to the effect India would not refer the matter to the Security Council. If not too late please immediately inform Bajpai that we would like the opportunity of commenting on the form in which they propose referring the matter to the Security Council and recommendations that they hope the Security Council will make.

Please reply Wednesday morning Canberra time.
