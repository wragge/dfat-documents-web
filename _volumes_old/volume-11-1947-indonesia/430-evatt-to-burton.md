Cablegram E65 NEW YORK, 21 November 1947, 2.45 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET PERSONAL

Your E115. [1] Indonesia.

1\. In my view the resolution of 1st November should be interpreted as requiring Dutch withdrawal to areas physically occupied on August 4th and Kirby would be fully justified in continuing to press for this.

2\. If Dutch reject suggestion Kirby should endeavour to persuade Graham and Van Zeeland to agree to report the position to the Security Council. If Van Zeeland dissents majority of Committee should report.
