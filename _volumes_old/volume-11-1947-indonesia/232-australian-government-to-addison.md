Cablegram 210 CANBERRA, 3 August 1947

SECRET

Further reference our 209. [1] Information you have received on the reaction of both parties will be similar to that we have received but no action has been taken yet to cease hostilities.

Indonesians will want assurance on position of Dutch troops.

Unless this matter is satisfactorily concluded before next meeting of the Security Council, Russia and Poland are bound to raise it and we would have to support any reasonable proposition. We strongly urge that every endeavour be made immediately to persuade Dutch voluntarily to withdraw forces at any rate to previously held positions. This would make further debate in Security Council unlikely.
