Cablegram 397 NEW DELHI, 28 July 1947, 6.45 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your telegram 280. [1]

On Sunday morning July 27th informed Sjahrir of Australian views and events in accordance with your telegram. Sjahrir was obviously pleased. His present intention is to remain in India some days and perhaps then go to the United Kingdom but visit to Australia only remote possibility. On July 27th and again today had talks with Sir Girja Bajpai, Secretary-General External Affairs and acquainted him of Australian views. He informed me that the Government of India being pressed from all quarters here and Nehru himself anxious to take positive action. India however has decided to wait until Monday for reply of U.S.A. to United Kingdom and if reply not satisfactory India will on Tuesday again consider bringing the Indonesian question before the Security Council.

Bajpai will keep me informed.
