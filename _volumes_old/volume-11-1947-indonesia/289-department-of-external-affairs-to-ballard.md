Cablegram 233 CANBERRA, 18 August 1947, 5.57 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

We have received a note [1] from the Legation here indicating the Netherlands Government invites Consular representatives in Batavia to examine actual situation and report. [2]

2\. Our first reaction is that this proposal is unacceptable to us, as it by-passes the Security Council and, in any case, we cannot see how Consular representatives at Batavia can adequately report on conditions throughout N.E.I. We will cable final reply, and, meanwhile, endeavour to avoid any comment.
