IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL

INDONESIA

I agree with your suggestion that you should discuss at once with the Prime Minister. [1] My view is that Security Council has the right and duty to investigate the situation and recommend adjustment. It is appropriate that approach should be made in judicial spirit without indication of any pre-conceived view and without prejudice to final settlement. This action is certain to be taken sooner or later and I see nothing but good in Australia as a good [2] taking the step with full explanation. [3] We have refrained from anything but good offices and we have given practical assistance to both parties. The situation will now deteriorate and as the Indonesian Government under agreement is to become a member of the United Nations [4], the matter is one of international and not merely domestic concern. At the same time the waterside workers' direct action is disgraceful as matter is one for the Government alone. Opinions of 'London Times' and 'New York Times' are significant and helpful. [5]

Purely Australian Commission would not be suitable.
