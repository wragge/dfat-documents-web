Cablegram 99 BATAVIA, 21 April 1947, 12.05 a.m. Received 21 April

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

I have been informed by telephone by the Palace tonight that following receipt of a message from The Hague the Netherlands East Indies Administration has tonight instructed the Netherlands Legation, Canberra, to inform you that visas may be granted to two Commercial Attaches to this Consulate-General. So far as I can gather at this stage decision as to number permitted is decision of Batavia and not The Hague and passports to be based on the number of commercial officers at other posts here.

It was further stated with reference to our undertaking not to embarrass the Netherlands East Indies Administration that conditions were imposed including the requirement that they should deal with the Indonesians through the Dutch and not visit the interior without Dutch consent.

Van Mook is visiting Makassar tomorrow for the opening of the East Indonesian Parliament but I shall see Boon early tomorrow.
