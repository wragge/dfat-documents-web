Cablegram 46 CANBERRA, 28 March 1947

SECRET

It would greatly assist in moving shipping if Sjahrir made a statement to the effect that he was anxious for trade between Australian ports and Java to commence as soon as possible to supply goods urgently needed in Java, and to send to Australia goods equally urgently required.

We have received a letter from Campbell indicating that he wishes to present credentials. [1] We may have no objection to Campbell personally, but Sjahrir should know that we would much prefer to receive as Trade Commissioner or representative of any kind, Indonesians who have been associated with the Government of Indonesia.

For your personal information, the appointment of Campbell or anyone else with his political affiliations [2] will not evoke the desired response.

This is a matter of some urgency as is also our request for information regarding the nature of representation desired between the two countries.
