Cablegram Hague 158 THE HAGUE, 6 September 1947, 7.55 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL AND MOST CONFIDENTIAL

I discussed the situation today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Political Director, Dr. van Mook and Dr. van Roijen.

The two latter go to New York tonight and hope to see the Minister there.

2\. There is general pessimism about the success of either the Consuls-General's enquiry or the Council's good offices. Van Mook assured me that the Consuls-General will be given every facility.

He seems hopeful of setting up an Indonesian Government of occupied territory.

3\. The general atmosphere regarding us is better than my telegram 152 [1] anticipated and I believe that now there is a good chance of Netherlands support for the Minister's candidature.
