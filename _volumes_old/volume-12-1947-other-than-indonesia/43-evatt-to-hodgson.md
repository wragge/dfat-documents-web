Cablegram 490 CANBERRA, 18 August 1947, 5.40 p.m.

PERSONAL MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

I have just been approached by Butler to support Italy's admission to the United Nations. I feel morally committed to this because of the acceptance of the position at Paris and it is very important for us not to multiply differences with the United States of America.

2\. We still hold to the two principles:

(a) of admission of approved neutrals before ex-enemies, (b) of consideration after the Assembly has discussed procedure, but at the same time you will appreciate the special conditions of Italy.
