Cablegram 113 CANBERRA, 26 February 1947

PERSONAL MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Japanese Mandates. Reference your U.N. 183.

Soviet change of front indicates attempt to appease on a matter which is only one of procedure made to gain advantages elsewhere.

2\. Your telegram shows need for close co-operation with United Kingdom in statement to be made to Security Council.

3\. In the circumstances, matter should be considered with Cadogan and, if possible, one should agree upon actual terms of statement to be made by him.

4\. This also confirms substance of my suggestions over 'phone.
