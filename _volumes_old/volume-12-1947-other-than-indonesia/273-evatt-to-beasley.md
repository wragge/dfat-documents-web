Cablegram 383 CANBERRA, 17 December 1947

SECRET IMMEDIATE

Glad of your urgent appreciation of likely moves by United Kingdom, United States and France in regard to Germany now that CFM has adjourned. In particular, we would like to know United Kingdom views on establishment of government for Western Germany and signing of separate peace treaty with such a government. In any event we would, of course, expect that no decisions would be made on a two or three-power basis which should be for decision by wider conference of belligerents.
