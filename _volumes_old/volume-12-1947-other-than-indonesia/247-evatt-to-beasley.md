Cablegram 53 CANBERRA, 13 February 1947, 3.40 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

AUSTRALIAN VIEWS ON SUBSTANCE OF GERMAN SETTLEMENT

My immediately following telegram contains revised text of our telegram 15 of 13th January 1947, and replaces instructions contained in that telegram. I think at the present stage it should be sufficient to submit these views in writing to Deputies. This should be done immediately. You will of course make it quite clear that our views arc provisional only. No final views can be formulated until we are in possession of all relevant facts, including views of other Governments concerned.
