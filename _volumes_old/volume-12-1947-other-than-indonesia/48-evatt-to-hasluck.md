Cablegram 8 CANBERRA, 7 January 1947, 5.110 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SECRET

Your UN.14. Disarmament.

You will have seen our telegram No. 5 which has crossed your UN.

14 and will have noted broad similarity of approach to problem in the two telegrams. I am glad to know your view that Australia has chance to take initiative on this subject which should of course have been taken by Australian Delegation to Assembly.

2\. Essence of instructions in our telegram No.5 is that problems raised by U.S.S.R. and U.S. are not mutually exclusive but are co- related and that a parallel approach to these problems should be pursued with vigour.
