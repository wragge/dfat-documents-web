Submission No.554—China Policy[1](#f1)

In view of the currently developing situation, the Cabinet decided to hold over its consideration of the Government’s future policy towards China.

2\. In the meantime, the position will be that present policy continues, namely—see paragraph 11(i) of the Submission—of seeking to normalise relations with the People’s Republic of China, moving at all times with caution and with a careful assessment of Australia’s interests.
