New York, 6 March 1972

UN134. Confidential

For Minister from Mcintyre

Your 158.[1](#f1)

According to ABC representatives who have been in contact with him, Kibel left New York last week for Boston and Canada and proposes to return here on or about 16 March. He apparently hopes to have another meeting with the Chinese, and has provisionally agreed to attend a cocktail party to be given by Brown (ABC)[2](#f2) on 17 March. He has told Brown that he will not be going on to Hong Kong as originally planned, since what he has learnt from the Chinese here makes this unnecessary.

He plans instead to go on to London.

2\. Kibel did not call on me while he was here. In case he should do so during his second visit, I presume you would wish us to withhold any approach to the Chinese Mission in the meantime.
