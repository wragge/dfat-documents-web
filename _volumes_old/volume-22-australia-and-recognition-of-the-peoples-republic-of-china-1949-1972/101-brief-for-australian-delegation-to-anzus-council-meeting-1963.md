16\. As to recognition, the emphasis should be put on the fact that China has herself to blame for not being recognised, by insisting that recognising countries acknowledge her rights to Taiwan. The question of China’s admission to the United Nations is complicated by her demand for the permanent Security Council seat.

17\. We must assume that the Chinese will explode a nuclear device about the end of this year. This will have a big propaganda impact, especially on China’s neighbours. We should prepare public opinion for what must be expected, and at the same time point out the considerable gulf between exploding a device and being able to deliver it effectively. One side effect, however, will be to increase pressure for China’s admission to the United Nations, particularly so that we[2](#f2) would be brought into disarmament negotiations.
