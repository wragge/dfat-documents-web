Seoul, 13 June 1966

162\. Secret Priority

For Plimsoll from Minister.

Our announcement on representation in Taiwan was well received by Chinese in Taipeh but today I received some indication that various interpretations may be placed on our move. For example Korean Foreign Minister[1](#f1) passed on a view ascribed to Chinese Foreign Minister that we might be preparing for a two China policy and repeated other speculations linking our action possibly with United States preparation for recognition of Peking by herself and supporters if United Nations vote goes against us. Apparently some doubts arise from recent indications of increased attention by United States and even ourselves to broader problems of future of mainland China. These speculations about our motives may multiply and I suggest you should take steps to ensure that any ministerial statements or any guidance given in Australia keep our move in the low key set by me in Taipeh communiqué and try to avoid giving our intention to fill vacancy in Taipeh too much significance or to magnify its importance. We should play it down as much as possible.

2\. Please show this message to Prime Minister and Acting Minister. Repeat to Washington if you think it necessary.
