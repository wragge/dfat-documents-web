PERSONAL FOR CHIFLEY ALONE FROM EVATT TOP SECRET

1\. Yesterday I had a talk with Attlee, Bevin and Noel-Baker.

[matter omitted]

3\. I took occasion to raise the whole question of the Pacific and South East Asia because for some considerable time, along with the Marshall policy the trend has been to concentrate almost solely on Europe. I told them our position in the Pacific and South East Asia compelled us to take up every opportunity of friendly relations with the Philippines, Siam and even Burma as well as India, Pakistan and Ceylon.

[matter omitted]

4\. Finally we agreed on the desirability of regional conferences covering South East Asia and they agreed generally that the best way to handle Communist infiltration was by encouraging progressive and democratic teams wherever possible and of course of improving the wretchedly low standards of existence. Nothing finally was agreed on as to conference but my idea is very much on the lines I have frequently referred to in past statements.
