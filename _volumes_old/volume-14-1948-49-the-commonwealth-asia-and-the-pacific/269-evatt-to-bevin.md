Message CANBERRA, 4 October 1949 [1]

It would be of great help to us to know at the earliest possible moment your views on recognition of the Northern Chinese Government. You will appreciate that in matters affecting the Pacific and the Far East we do not want any action taken in anticipation of action here. Personally, I do not see why this Government should not be recognised in respect of its effective area of occupation, retaining recognition of the National Government similarly. There are also some advantages in the Assembly appointing a United Nations Commission to keep the Chinese situation under constant review, reporting immediately if there were any threat of aggression, for example, against Hong Kong. Above all, I think Australia's action should be concerted with the United Kingdom. Best wishes.
