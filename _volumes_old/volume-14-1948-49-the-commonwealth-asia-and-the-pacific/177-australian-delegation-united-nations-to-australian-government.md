Cablegram UN196 (extract) NEW YORK, 18 March 1949, 8.59 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

Your 154 to Washington ECAFE.

1\. ECOSOC [1], debate on ECAFE interim report [2] produced nothing constructive with regard to further direction of Commission's work. USSR recapitulated its ground for dissatisfaction as previously advanced at Lapstone. Other delegations perfunctorily expressed satisfaction with progress to date, but there was general undertone that Commission should now advance from fact finding to action.

2\. Number of Council delegations now contain people well informed about ECAFE from whom comments could be obtained.

1 The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.

2 The report of the 4th Session.
