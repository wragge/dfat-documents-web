1 Document 279 2 Mighell replied in cablegram 4819, dispatched 17 November, that Bevin had said that when United Kingdom recognised the Communist Government it would have to vote 'for the representative of the Communist Government taking the Chinese place as a permanent member of the Security Council'.
