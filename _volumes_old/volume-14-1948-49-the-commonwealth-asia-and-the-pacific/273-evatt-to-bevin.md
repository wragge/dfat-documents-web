Message [1] CANBERRA, 19 October 1949

SECRET Begins. Thanks for your message. [2] The Crucial thing is that, when action is taken, whether at the United Nations or separately, it should be joint action and synchronised. It occurred to me that perhaps, prior to negotiations regarding recognition and part of the agreement regarding recognition, we could get some specific undertaking from the new Government to respect the territorial integrity of Hong Kong and other neighbouring territories. A joint commission of some kind might be established to keep in touch for this purpose. Ends.
