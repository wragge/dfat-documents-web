Cablegram 156 TOKYO, 28 April 1948

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Your 227 and 225. [1]

While the attitude taken by you is fully appreciated it is regretted that telegrams to you on this subject were not authorised by me and were sent without my approval. I should be glad if for the present the matter could not be pursued. I realize that this may cause some embarrassment to you but it might be possible to avoid this by a carefully guarded statement.

1 Cablegram 225, dispatched 23 April 1948, reported that Shaw had arranged to discuss the coastguard matter at a special meeting of the Allied Council on 28 April and had asked Sebald whether promulgation of the ordinance could be suspended. Cablegram 227, dispatched 24 April 1948, reported that General Headquarters SCAP had stated vessels would be unarmed and had stressed the security nature of the force. In the light of this, Sebald had suggested that Shaw might wish to ask the Australian Government to reconsider raising it in ACJ. Shaw, in reply, had asserted the right of members to be consulted and to express their views.
