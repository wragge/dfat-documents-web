Cablegram 219 NEW DELHI, 23 March 1949, 4.10 p.m.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTED

Your telegram 122. E.C.A.F.E.

We have discussed your proposals with the Ministry of External Affairs and B.N. Adarkar, Deputy Economic Adviser to the Government of India, who will represent India at the Bangkok meeting.

2\. The Indians agreed that there had been a lack of progress.

While appreciating your proposal, they thought that this should supplement rather than be a substitution for a Committee representing member Governments. In effect, they consider E.C.A.F.E. should function through conference plus an inter- governmental Committee of Experts assisted by an expert secretariat.

3\. They claim that such an inter-governmental Committee embracing all member countries is a necessary organ if member governments of E.C.A.F.E. are to be made to face up to their responsibilities, especially at the stage when plans are to be implemented.

4\. They thought that there was a need of a secretariat with the type of function listed in your cable particularly for more undeveloped countries in the area. But in so far as India herself is concerned, they argue that she had passed beyond that stage, and is therefore, mainly anxious to see the creation of a body which will be effective in organizing joint governmental action in the provision of capital and technical assistance.
