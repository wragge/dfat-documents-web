 _Disarmament_

Telegram 290[1](#f1) to you from Washington states that Rusk will provide the Prime Minister with a list of countries which, while pressing strongly for disarmament, were continually seeking themselves to purchase arms abroad.[2](#f2)

  2. The following comment is offered without knowing the background of Rusk's offer and hence which of several possible arguments the figures are intended to demonstrate.
  3. The fact that a country is simultaneously pressing for disarmament and seeking arms is not by itself evidence of hypocrisy or double standard. A government might genuinely want world disarmament and at the same time realize that it cannot itself become disarmed unless there is a world disarmament system with adequate measures for inspection enforcement and control.
  4. See my talk with R.K. Nehru (formerly Secretary-General of Indian Ministry for External Affairs) on 26th March, 1964 (copy dated 31st March was sent to External Affairs Officer London from New Delhi).[3](#f3) In para. 14 Nehru and I discussed the problems of countries like Australia and India which in the past had kept their defence expenditure to a minimum and had threatened no-one, but which were now obliged to rearm and which, therefore, could not accept disarmament proposals calling for a uniform percentage cut in defence expenditure as assessed at some unacceptable date.
