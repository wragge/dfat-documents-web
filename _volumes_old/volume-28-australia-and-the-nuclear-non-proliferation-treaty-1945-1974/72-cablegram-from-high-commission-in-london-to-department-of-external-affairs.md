London, 3 August 1965

6659\. Secret

Indonesia and Atomic Bomb

Foreign Office have report from Gilchrist,[1](#f1) Djakarta, that Japanese Embassy has heard from source found reliable for two years that Chinese atomic bomb is to be exploded on an Indonesian island about 5 October. Report mentions island in Indian Ocean but also refers to building of jet airstrip in Natuna Islands and to existence of strip capable of handling C.130s on Ranai.

  2. British note that timing would be right for next Chinese test but point out that intensive security precautions taken by Chinese in previous tests would be harder to effect on island. For example, air sampling would be easier to arrange.
