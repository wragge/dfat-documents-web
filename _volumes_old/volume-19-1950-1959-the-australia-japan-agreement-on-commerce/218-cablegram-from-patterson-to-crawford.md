 **Australia-Japanese Trade Agreement**

At a social function last night I met a number of senior Board of Trade officials and I gathered that their general feeling in relation to this agreement is that some liberalisation of Japanese imports to Australia was to be expected but they consider that if the reports are correct then our steps are too comprehensive and rather risky; if a more gradual approach over say three years was implemented it would be more palatable to United Kingdom industries and would not cause any political disturbance here.

B.O.T. also concerned that Australia may be considering granting special quotas for Japanese imports as distinct from including any benefits under the agreement within the present import licensing limits.

This view is passed to you as information and not at the request of the B.O.T.
