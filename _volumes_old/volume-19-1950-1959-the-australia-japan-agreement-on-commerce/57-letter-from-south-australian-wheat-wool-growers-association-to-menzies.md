ADELAIDE

At the Annual Conference of the above Association held in Adelaide recently, the following resolution was carried.

'That this Conference views with concern the racial arguments used by self-interested Manufacturing interests whose principal purpose is to shut out mainly the Japanese, and other foreign countries' goods, and thus strangle our wool trade with Japan and other countries, who purchase Australian Wool.'

Trusting your Government will give consideration to this resolution.

T.C. STOTT General Secretary
