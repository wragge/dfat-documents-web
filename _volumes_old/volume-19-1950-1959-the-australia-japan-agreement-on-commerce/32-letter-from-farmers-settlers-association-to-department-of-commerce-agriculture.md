17th June, 1953

The Executive Committee of this Association at a meeting held on the 12th inst., discussed a matter which had arisen from newspaper publicity on that date regarding the reported attitude of Japan with regard to wool purchases from Australia and the limitation of such because of the effect of trade restriction on sterling credit.

My Executive appreciates that the subject is one of considerable importance having many facets of bearing on world trade generally and particularly Australia. There is also the aspect of war effect on the Australian people in development of trade with Japan.

It is considered by the Committee however, that the importance of preservation of development of Australian exports of primary products is essential to the Nation, therefore it is felt that there should be some consideration given to examination of some of the lesser secondary industries regarding the protection afforded those and luxury industries, a protection which may not be warranted and is having the effect of restriction of trade with Japan.

My Committee is not making a recommendation other than one of suggestion that your Department might well examine the position with a view to the long range assurance of markets for Australian primary products.

J.T. McDOUGALL General Secretary
