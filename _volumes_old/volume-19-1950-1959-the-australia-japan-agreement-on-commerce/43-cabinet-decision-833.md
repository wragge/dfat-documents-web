Submission No. 542-Trade with Japan

Cabinet agreed:

(1) to increase the level of licensing of Japanese imports from 12m. c.i.f. per annum to 18m. c.i.f. per annum as from 1st October, next; and

(2) that the range of permitted imports within this higher ceiling be widened to enable a better assessment of the strength of present-day Japanese competition.

Cabinet directed that a full investigation into Australia's trading position, vis-a-vis Japan, should be immediately undertaken by the Departments of Trade and Customs, Commerce, National Development and Treasury.

Cabinet observed that the application of this decision to New Guinea should be worked out by the Departments of Trade and Customs, Treasury and Territories.
