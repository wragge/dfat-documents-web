PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL

(Due to arrive Canberra 8.6.29)

My dear P.M.,

In an earlier letter I mentioned the advertisement by Corporation & General Securities Ltd. [1], urging the public to 'invest British'. This was one of a series of such advertisements prior to the issue of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works loan. I put in hand some enquiries about Corporation & General Securities Ltd., and enclose herewith copy of a letter from a friend in the City.

I also enclose 'Times' report of Corporation & General Securities Ltd.'s recent General Meeting and other notices. It may interest you to know privately that their advertisements were written by Grondona. [2]

I am, Yours sincerely, R.G. CASEY 

_1 Letter 193.

2 Leo St Clare Grondona, Australian-born publicist.
