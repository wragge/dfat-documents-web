Cablegram K173 BATAVIA, 14 October 1948

SECRET

Setyadjid was killed four days ago, while Alimin and a number of other important communists were captured on October 10. The net is reported to be closing around Muso, Sjarifuddin and the other communists.

2\. Communists are suspected of murdering Muwardi, leader of the G.R.R. (see paragraph 3 of my telegram K. 158 [1]) whose mutilated body was found outside Solo.

3\. The Republican Government has been endeavouring to suppress the news of Setyadjid's death and fears that a rising tide of dissension may follow news of killings and counter killings.
