Cablegram ECAFE 5 OOTACAMUND, 2 June 1948, 8.45 p.m.

The whole day taken up by discussions on admission of the Republic of Indonesia.

The Netherlands delegate took up the proposal submitted at the last session for admission of the whole of Indonesia as an associate member under Netherlands sponsorship. [1] Relied mainly on Renville agreement as I intimated in my telegram 4. [2]

The Indian delegate supported separate application by the Republic for associate membership but without prejudice to final settlement between the Republic and the Netherlands. I explained our attitude along the lines of your telegram 2 [3] and declared support for the Republic application. I suggested that the term 'provisional' might be used to avoid possible enlargement in the work of the Good Offices Commission. The Indian delegate and supporters not in favour of the term 'provisional associate member' but would be prepared to write into the minutes that admission as an associate member would be without prejudice to final political settlement.

On the motion of the Chinese delegate the discussion adjourned until Saturday morning to allow the Netherlands and Indian delegates particularly to attempt a compromise. I will be closely in touch with both delegations and inform you of developments. The Republic's application seems certain to be carried with our support probably the decisive factor. The United Kingdom, United States and France against. New Zealand veers towards support although not yet a certainty.
