Cablegram 297 CANBERRA, 3 November 1948, 3 p.m.

SECRET

As you know, Fourth Session of Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is due to begin in Australia on 29th of this month.

We are anxious to avoid if possible a protracted dispute on the question of admission Indonesian Republic to associate membership such as has taken place at last two sessions. [1]

2\. So far we have had no official indication that the Republic intends to send a delegation to this session. If a delegation arrives and applies for associate membership we shall of course do everything possible to ensure its admission in some capacity or other.

3\. Please sound out Republican Government urgently as to its intentions.
