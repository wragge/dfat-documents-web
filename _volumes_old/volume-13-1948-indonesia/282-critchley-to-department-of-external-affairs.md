Cablegram K175 BATAVIA, 19 October 1948

SECRET

Reference my K. 174. [1] Hatta's reply to Cochran and the Netherlands will probably be along the following lines. The Republic reaffirms its willingness to resume negotiations on the conditions it has stated and on the basis of Cochran's plan. The Dutch amendments which aim at the complete liquidation of the Republic point to the probability of deadlock, but these amendments can only be considered by the Republic after the resumption of negotiations. The Republic will present its own amendments immediately negotiations are resumed.
