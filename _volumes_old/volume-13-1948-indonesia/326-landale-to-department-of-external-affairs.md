Cablegram Hag 181 THE HAGUE, 24 November 1948, 6.10 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Reference to your telegram No. 121 [1] Fourth Session, E.C.A.F.E.

I have discussed this matter with Boon, Director of the Political Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who advised me that the Dutch Government could only support attendance of a Republican representative (under paragraph 3(a)IV) [2] in a consultative capacity on condition that the whole of Indonesia was at the same time granted associate membership.

2\. The Dutch Government prefers that the question of associate membership should not arise at this point.

3\. In view of current negotiations in Indonesia, Boon informally expressed the hope that if this subject was placed on the agenda it might be possible to defer any discussion on it until towards the end of the session by which time an agreement might have been reached.
