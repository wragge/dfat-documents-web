Cablegram K148 BATAVIA, 24 July 1948

SECRET

Committee's reports on Trade Restrictions [1] and on postponement of negotiations [2] will give the Republic as good an opportunity as it is likely to have of taking a firm line in the Security Council and dramatising the present situation.

Many Republicans now regard prospect of peaceful solution as most unlikely and the Republic may therefore endeavour to submit Australian/U.S. proposals [3] to the Security Council. It seems clear that only some intervention by the Council can prevent a further serious deterioration in the situation.
