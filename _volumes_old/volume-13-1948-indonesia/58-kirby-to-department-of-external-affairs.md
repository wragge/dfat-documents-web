Cablegram UN121 NEW YORK, 11 February 1948, 8.14 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Today at Lake Success I had informal chat with Cadogan and gave him my general views. Cadogan reserved but seemed to agree that Dutch needed pressing either in or outside Council. He said he could not however take any position either way without instructions.

2\. McNaughton told us today Council Meeting would be definitely Tuesday.

3\. On Friday Graham, Van Zeeland and I are meeting Secretary Marshall at Washington. Nothing has been said to us to indicate that this is other than a formal call by Committee nor have Americans mentioned again subject of our Washington conversation.
