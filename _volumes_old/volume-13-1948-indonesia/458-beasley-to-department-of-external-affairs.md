Cablegram 4559 LONDON, [24 December] 1948, 4 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

Subandrio, Indonesia representative here, called 24th December and stated that he was trying to communicate with his Administration through Indian Government so far unsuccessfully. He said a United Kingdom Consul was probably going to Djockjakarta to observe and if necessary seek improvement of welfare of political detainees.

He hoped we might also send someone from Batavia. He alleges that Spoor has a plan for liquidation of Indonesian political leaders and intellectuals.

2\. I promised telegraph you immediately.

3\. At that time we did not have results of vote in Security Council.
