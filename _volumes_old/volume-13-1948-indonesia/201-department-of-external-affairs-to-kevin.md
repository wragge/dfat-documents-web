Cablegram 180 CANBERRA, 2 July 1948, 10.50 a.m.

Your 268. [1] Indonesia.

We are sending you by bag copy of full text of United States - Australian Working Paper [2] which was submitted to Netherlands and Republican delegates 10th June.

Indian Government's understanding of the main points of the plan is correct. We consider that, while some of its features may be unacceptable to the Dutch in their present form, plan as a whole provides a sound basis for settlement of outstanding issues and for orderly transition from Netherlands to Indonesian sovereignty.

We have been strongly in favour all along of Committee of Good Offices taking initiative since it has become increasingly clear that parties are unable to reach agreement as between themselves.

At recent meetings of Security Council our representative has been pressing to have United States - Australian plan considered by the Council on its merits.
