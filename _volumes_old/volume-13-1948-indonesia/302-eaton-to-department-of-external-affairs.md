After talks with Neher, Koets and Cochran have the impression that the Dutch are making a final attempt to negotiate with the Republic to join the Interim Government. Cochran is very close to Stikker who is proceeding to the Republic for discussions with Hatta and his Cabinet. This has been arranged by Cochran against the wishes of the local Palace Authorities.
