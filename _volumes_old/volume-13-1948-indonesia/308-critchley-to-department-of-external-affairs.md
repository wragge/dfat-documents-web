Cablegram K187 BATAVIA, 7 November 1948, 3.11 p.m.

Republican Delegation has replied [1] to the Netherlands letter transmitted by Cochran (see my telegram No. K182 [2]). The Republic notes with satisfaction the Netherlands wish for an early resumption of negotiations. It agrees on the desirability of a full implementation of the truce, but cannot accept Netherlands accusation that the Republic is responsible for failures to date.

The Republican Delegation is ready to discuss the question of truce implementation. On the other hand it stresses that the delay in reaching a political settlement imposes additional strain on the truce. The Republican Delegation therefore suggests that truce and political discussions proceed concurrently and points out that this is possible under the Committee's normal procedure of working through five main committees.

The reply was transmitted to the Netherlands Delegation last night.
