Cablegram 499 NEW DELHI, 21 December 1948, 3 p.m.

SECRET

We spoke with Ubani yesterday who considers publicity given Soekarno's visit to India hastened Dutch offensive. Indonesians had expected it early in January on the formation by the Dutch of an Interim Government. He did not support a local agency report that an Indonesian Government in exile might be formed in India, saying that the Republicans still held out in Sumatra. He did not appear confident of the Republicans' ability to resist in Java but said that there was greater hope in Sumatra whose hills and mountains provided obstacles against mechanised troops. He repeated his earlier statement that material help from friendly countries was most necessary but was vague about the form it might take.
