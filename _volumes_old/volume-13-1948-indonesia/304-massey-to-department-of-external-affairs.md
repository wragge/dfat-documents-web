Cablegram 622 SINGAPORE, 5 November 1948, 12.21 p.m.

TOP SECRET

My telegram 611. [1] At risk of reporting what you may already know, Chairman J.I.C. yesterday evening disclosed the receipt of a telegram from F.O. meeting of Bevin and Stikker. [2] Stikker was adamant that further police action was necessary as all indications are that there will be need [3] for [4] have Dutch army domination in Batavia. [5]

1 Document 292.

2 The reference is presumably to a meeting between Stikker and Bevin in Paris on 26 October.

3 A sign here indicates 'mutilated'.

4 A sign here indicates 'indecypherable'.

5 Massey repeated Cablegram 622 to Batavia on 5 November as Cablegram 57. The last sentence of the Batavia version, on file AA:A4357/2, 48/254, v, was decyphered as: 'Stikker was adamant that further police action was necessary as all indications are that there will be (?) pressure on Dutch army troops (?) in Batavia.'
