Cablegram 95 CANBERRA, 19 April 1948, 2.35 p.m.

SECRET

Your K102.

Your account of arrival at Djojakarta confirms our impressions from press and radio reports that while local demonstration may have got a little out of hand (as Republicans appear to have admitted) it did not justify stiff Dutch reaction. Committee should lose no opportunity of urging Netherlands Authorities to take a realistic view of incidents of this sort and of reminding them that they will gain no advantage from holding up negotiations on technicalities.

Suggested minority report on Bantam seems satisfactory.
