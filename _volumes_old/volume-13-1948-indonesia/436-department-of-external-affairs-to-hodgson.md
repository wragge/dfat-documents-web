Cablegram P290 CANBERRA, 23 December 1948

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

We have not received your report [1] but it is disturbing to find from the press an adjournment without a vote taken. You will recall that, when we raised the matter originally, the aim was to call for a vote without debate on the question of cease-fire, and, when Council meets again, you should move closure and insist on immediate vote. Minister's telegram of 20th [2] has just been received and, in relation to this, see last sentence of paragraph 5.

1 i.e. Hodgson's report on the Security Council discussion on Indonesia in Paris on 22 December (see Document 437). 2 Document 393.
