Australia has given, as have United Kingdom and U.S.A., de facto recognition to Republic and nothing in Renville agreement alters basis for that as principles of agreement have not yet been worked out. Until final agreement between Dutch and Republic is reached by which Republic authority is incorporated in wider government or government for the Republican area is otherwise provided for and Republican interests thereby represented, Republic has de facto authority. As such it must take its separate place as a de facto authority on any international body dealing with matters of direct concern to it. On these grounds you should give support to Republic as provisional associate member with full voting powers.
