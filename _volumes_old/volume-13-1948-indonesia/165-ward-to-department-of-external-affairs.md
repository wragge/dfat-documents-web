Cablegram ECAFE 9 OOTACAMUND, 5 June 1948, 7.25 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

[matter omitted]

INDONESIA: Chinese delegate reports that no agreement had been reached between Indian delegation representing the Republic and the Netherlands. Philippines delegate then moved the postponement of the question until the next session of the Commission seconded by the United States. The Netherlands delegate read telegrams from his government urging the Commission to consider the consequences of admission of the Republic separately. Alleged such admission would seriously interfere with the work of the Good Offices Commission.

Indian delegates proposed adjournment till Wednesday to investigate offer of compromise by the Republican delegation.

Above matter afoot for Republic to accept separate associate membership under Netherlands sponsor; rest of Indonesia would be form of second associate member.

Indian proposal carried 8 to 3, France, Netherlands, Philippines against, China and the United Kingdom abstaining. If the question of postponement to session alone had been put I abstain so as not to overtly oppose the admission of the Republic to this session and at the same time not to obstruct what amounts to some degree of compromise by the Netherlands. If no compromise between the Netherlands and the Republic reached by Wednesday, proposals to postpone until next session likely to be made again; would appreciate instructions. Postponement will be opposed by India who desires to force the issue in this session.
