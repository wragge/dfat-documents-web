Cablegram 134 CANBERRA, 24 May 1948, 6 p.m.

Our 133. [1] United States suggestion as reported from New York is obviously vague as at present conceived. Nevertheless, if properly contrived it would obviously assist the Republic, particularly on the question of trade. The question of tactics will be important.

Glad of early advice on Republican Government's reaction.
