Cablegram Hag 170 THE HAGUE, 5 November 1948

CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

The conservative paper 'Trouw' has expressed pained surprise that Stikker was going to the Republic instead of waiting for Hatta in Batavia. [1] According to this paper the Netherlands Government have dropped their former condition that the truce violations must cease before reopening of discussions with the Republicans.

2\. The 'Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant' believes that the Cabinet is divided on this point and asks for a clear cut statement on unanimity.

3\. In informal discussions I have had with the Deputy Director of the Political Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vigeveno, has emphasised the growing strength of Tan Malakka and his followers.

He has also pointed out that the decision of Stikker to go to the Republic was not an easy one as the Netherlands Government was under pressure from the Federalists to proceed immediately with the institution of the interim Government and they (the Federalists) might interpret this visit as a sign of weakness on the part of the Netherlands Government.
