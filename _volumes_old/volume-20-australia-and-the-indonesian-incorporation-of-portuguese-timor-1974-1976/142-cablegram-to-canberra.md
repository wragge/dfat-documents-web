NewYork, 6 June 1975

O.UN3113 CONFIDENTIAL RouTINE

## Committee of Twenty-Four: Portuguese Timor

### Ref O.UN3103 [1](#f1)

Campbell arranged 6 June with the Chairman of the Committee of Twenty-Four and the Secretariat to amend paragraph 6 on their own initiative to delete the word 'soon' and add the words 'as appropriate'. The paragraph will now read

'6. With regard to Timor and dependencies, the only remaining colonial territory under Portuguese administration outside Africa, the Special Committee expresses the hope that the necessary steps will be taken as appropriate to enable the people of the territory to exercise their right to self-determination and independence as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in conformity with the Declaration on the Granting of lndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.'
