Letter [CANBERRA], 10 July 1944

With reference to your letter to me, dated 30th May [1], regarding your proposal to set up an organisation for post-hostilities planning in international affairs, I have examined this matter closely but feel that I cannot concur with such an organisation being set up.

I feel that it would ultimately result in a sort of super department exercising jurisdiction over other departments which could only, in regard particularly to Treasury and Commerce, result in friction.

There are matters, of course, which are wholly within the province of your Department, and as such your Department is most competent to deal with them. Apart from that, however, I feel that your proposal is not one which I could support.

J. B. CHIFLEY
