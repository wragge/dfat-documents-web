TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL

Your Winch No. 11. [1]

You can rely upon our complete co-operation in regard to the provision of facilities in Australia to enable the main British Fleet to operate against Japan.

I am suitably advising the Services and other Departments concerned and agree to detailed and technical aspects being discussed between Defence and Service authorities in accordance with existing procedure. Questions of policy and principle will be dealt with through normal Governmental channels.
