Cablegram [22A] [1] LONDON, 11 February 1944, 7.20 p.m.

SECRET

Addressed to the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin.

War Crimes Commission. Dominions Office telegram [D.182] of 7th February. [2]

In your telegram 3 of 7th January [3] you acquiesced in the proposed course of action suggested in telegram D.No. [1077] of 8th December. [4] Notwithstanding this the United Kingdom have adopted an entirely different course [5] without any notification to you until the action has been taken. While in the present case I do not think any particular harm has been done, a very important principle is involved. I have accordingly offered a strong protest and warned the United Kingdom that a repetition of this sort of thing will inevitably lead to serious trouble.

While I think we can let the episode pass with my protest, a telegram from you if you felt so disposed would have a salutary effect.

BRUCE
