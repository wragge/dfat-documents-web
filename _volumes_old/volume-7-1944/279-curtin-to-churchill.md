Cablegram [Johcu] [1] 83 CANBERRA, 14 September 1944

SECRET

Considerable speculation and criticism are appearing in Australian newspapers to the effect Pacific strategy is being discussed at Quebec [2] and Australian representatives are not present.

2\. I note you have requested [3] Sir William Glasgow to be in Quebec and to meet you. I have now arranged with General Blamey to direct General Lavarack, Head of the Australian Military Mission in the United States, to proceed to Quebec and to be available for any discussion on service level which may arise from your consultations with President. I will in all probability make an announcement to this effect.

3\. I sincerely hope you are having satisfactory consultations.

Warmest regards.

JOHN CURTIN
