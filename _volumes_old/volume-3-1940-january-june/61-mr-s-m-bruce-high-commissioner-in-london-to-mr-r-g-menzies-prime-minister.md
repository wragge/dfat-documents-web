Cablegram 122 LONDON, 15 February 1940, 7.14 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY

Dominions Office cable re Sumner Welles' visit. [1] In my view cable shows marked influence of pro-French school in the Foreign Office in its stressing of the danger of the visit stimulating pressure for premature peace. In my opinion, if properly handled, the visit should result in strengthening the Allies' position in the United States.
