Circular cablegram D237 (extract) LONDON, 7 June 1940, 2.50 a.m.

MOST SECRET FOLLOWING FOR PRIME MINISTER

UNITED STATES

(4) Progress in United States. Public opinion towards willingness to help the Allies together with the counteracting of terrors and fears in the United States as regards the possibility of involvement in the totalitarian war has led us to consider launching a campaign designed to show that it is neither to our interest nor our benefit that the United States should become involved in the totalitarian warfare. By depriving isolationists of their main argument, it is hoped that the Congress will thus be able to move faster over measures designed to help us.
