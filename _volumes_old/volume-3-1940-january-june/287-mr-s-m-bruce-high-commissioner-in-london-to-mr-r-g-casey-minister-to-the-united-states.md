Cablegram 13 LONDON, 27 May 1940, 12.20 p.m.

IMMEDIATE

I am sending you as soon as they can be encyphered copies of two cables I have sent to the Prime Minister. [1] They speak for themselves. Seriousness of position cannot be exaggerated. U.S.A.

is as seriously menaced as we are. In my view immediate energetic and great visioned action by Roosevelt essential. Views expressed in this and other cables purely personal but feel deeply United Kingdom Government still reluctant face realities and that you should talk to U.S.A. Authorities with absolute frankness.

I am not sure whether you have a copy of recyphering table I.D.

'V' (7) or whether you get the Embassy to encypher the telegrams which you send in it. These two telegrams of mine should be decyphered by your own Legation Staff.

BRUCE
