Cablegram 131 LONDON, 20 February 1940, 7.04 p.m.

FOR PRIME MINISTER SECRET

WOOL

In my view cable to Whiskard [1] with reference to method of allocating supply and of determining price hardly a representation of position as it exists at the moment.

I am hopeful however that as a result of overhaul caused by our persistence of last few weeks position described in the cable to Whiskard will be brought about in the near future.
