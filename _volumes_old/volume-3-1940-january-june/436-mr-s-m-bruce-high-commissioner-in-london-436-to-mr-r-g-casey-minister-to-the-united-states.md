Cablegram 26 LONDON, 25 June 1940

FOR CASEY

Cable to Lothian No. 1262. [1] I always have felt and still feel that it is imperative that we, in conjunction with the United States, should pursue a positive instead of a negative policy with Japan down the lines indicated when I saw Halifax in November [2] and sketched in letter to Officer December 12th. [3] Am apprehensive that action has been left too late but something may be accomplished if we move quickly enough. [4]
