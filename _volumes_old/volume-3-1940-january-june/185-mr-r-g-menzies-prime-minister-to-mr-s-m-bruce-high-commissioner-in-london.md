Cablegram unnumbered 29 April 1940,

Your telegram April 23rd. [1] Barley and flour sales were contracted April 18th. Does Ministry of Economic Warfare consider there is serious likelihood that commodities such as barley wheat and flour would be carried via Siberia to Germany. Answer to this question very important to us as there are prospects of further sales to Japan. Can United Kingdom Government say what British or French channels they have in mind.
