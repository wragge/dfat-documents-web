Cablegram 9 LONDON, 3 January 1940, 8.08 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

War Cabinet has today been considering the question of German iron 

ore supplies from Sweden, only source still open. German stock 

unquestionably short probably not more than three months. Supplies 

are shipped from Narvik and Lulea but from the latter only in 

summer. Narvik supply [sic], owing to their going through 

Norwegian territorial waters, have to date not been intercepted. 

Norwegian Government now being informed that owing to outrages by 

Germany on merchant shipping in territorial waters United Kingdom 

propose to treat such waters as open sea. Final decision will be 

taken when Norwegian reaction is ascertained. Sweden has already 

been approached but notwithstanding that iron ore concerned is 

Swedish offered no objection and indicated that the matter was one 

for Norway.

Question of probable action by Germany resulting against Norway 

and for [sic] [1] Sweden was considered in conjunction with whole 

Scandinavian position which is already under examination.
