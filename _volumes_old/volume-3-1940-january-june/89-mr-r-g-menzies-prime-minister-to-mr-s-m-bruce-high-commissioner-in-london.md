Cablegram unnumbered 4 March 1940,

Your telegram 5th February. [1] Full consideration has been given to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On balance, however, the Government of the Commonwealth believes the appointment of Minister to both Japan and to China at the present time is desirable. We are not satisfied that if directly represented we could not contribute a useful point of view.

Moreover, the present state of tension may not ease for a few years and the increasing significance of the Far East to Australia appears to outweigh other considerations. Please therefore proceed as indicated in my telegram of 25th January [2] with respect to appointment of Minister both to Japan and China. The appointment to Japan will probably take precedence by a few months.
