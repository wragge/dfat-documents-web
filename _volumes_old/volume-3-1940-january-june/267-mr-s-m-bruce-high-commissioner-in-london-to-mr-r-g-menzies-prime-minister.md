Cablegram 350 LONDON, 23 May 1940, 10 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Your cable re Roosevelt [1] have just learnt that War Cabinet considered it on basis that you were suggesting public appeal and that reply was being drafted on this assumption. I have pointed out that this is a complete misunderstanding and that your suggestion was the reinforcement, privately and personally, as representing young democratic dominions, of efforts Churchill [2] already making.
