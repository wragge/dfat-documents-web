FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Czechoslovakia My telegram No. 11 of 5th January. [1] When Benes [2] came to see me I told him that copies of the letters exchanged between Halifax [3] and myself [4] had been sent on to you and that you would doubtless communicate your views in due course. I was particularly careful to make it clear to him that Australian recognition of the Czechoslovak National Committee could only be for the purpose of his recruiting effort for Czechoslovak forces.

Benes has again approached Eden [5] stating that he has received favourable answer as regards New Zealand and South Africa and Eden asks if the Commonwealth Government will expedite its decision.
