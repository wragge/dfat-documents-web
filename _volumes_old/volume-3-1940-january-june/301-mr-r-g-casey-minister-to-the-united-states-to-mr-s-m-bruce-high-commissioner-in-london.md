Cablegram 25 WASHINGTON, 28 May 1940

Your No. 14. [1]

I saw President [2] today. He fully appreciates potential gravity of European situation. He will help all he possibly can although numbers of existing weapons of the type you are interested in are very small indeed owing to fact that since war began the people here have foregone taking new supplies in order that Allies could get maximum supply. I can assure you that the vital importance of British fleet continuing to exist under any circumstances is fully appreciated here.
