Cablegram 36 LONDON, 12 January 1940, 7.10 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Your telegram [1], which arrived in time for the Prime Minister 

[2] to read at the commencement of the War Cabinet this morning, 

was invaluable. After full discussion it was decided to abandon 

the contemplated action. Closest contact with the Norwegian and 

Swedish Governments is to be maintained and desirability of 

sending the Lord Privy Seal [3] to Scandinavia was discussed. 

Personally I consider that such action would be ill-advised and I 

anticipate that on further examination idea will be abandoned.

BRUCE
