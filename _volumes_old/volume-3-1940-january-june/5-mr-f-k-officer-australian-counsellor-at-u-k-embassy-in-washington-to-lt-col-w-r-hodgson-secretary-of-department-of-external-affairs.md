Cablegram 6 (extract) WASHINGTON, 5 January 1940, 11.17 p.m.

Information: Legation will of course be devoid of all information 

except from sources one has opened up and the press unless some 

arrangement is made with the Embassy. [1] Suggest I arrange to 

continue to have access to press reports done by the British 

Library of Information in New York and various consular reports on 

which to a large extent my present information is based. As 

regards information on the outside world, the Minister will, of 

course, be making his own arrangements as regards Australia, but 

as regards Europe suggest External Affairs in London be instructed 

to send the Minister duplicates of all his information 'Lon.' 

letters, etc. and that I arrange with the Embassy to have access 

to 'Intel' series of weekly political intelligence summaries, etc.

As we will be without any technical advisers, I suggest that the 

Foreign Office be asked to allow us access to the three service 

Attaches.

These proposals as regards information, etc., are, of course, 

requests for facilities neither Canada nor South Africa enjoy, but 

in view of our special relations here and in London, I do not 

anticipate that the Foreign Office would raise any objection. [2]

2 Hodgson replied: 'Information: Mr. Stirling is being asked to 

ascertain Foreign Office's attitude as regards access to Service 

Attaches at Embassy and also as to possibility of supply of copies 

of Foreign Office print. He will be instructed to send duplicates 

of his despatches and to repeat his more important telegrams. 

Presume that "Intel" series covers adequate information conveyed 

in Dominions Office "Intel" telegrams. If not, Mr. Stirling could 

be asked to supplement. It is proposed that Legation should 

receive regular information telegrams from here covering 

Australian developments.' (See cablegram 3 of 9 January 1940 on 

file AA: A3300, 78.)
