Cablegram 16 LONDON, 31 May 1940, 10 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR MR CASEY HIMSELF PERSONALLY

Your telegram No. 29. [2]

Halifax [3] asked me to convey his appreciation of your presentation of position [to] Sumner Welles [4] which he considers admirable.

As I felt effect might be prejudiced if (it was) thought here your action has been prompted by me, I substituted in second paragraph for reference to my opinion 'my information was that opinion was strongly held'.

I also eliminated third paragraph as I felt it would be considered particularly by the Prime Minister [5] too defeatist and would prevent cable receiving consideration it deserves.

 _

1 Although received in the Legation at this time, the cablegram was not delivered to Casey until 9.30 a.m. on 1 June 1940.

2 Document 319.

3 U.K. Foreign Secretary.

4 U.S. Under-Secretary of State.

5 Winston S. Churchill.
