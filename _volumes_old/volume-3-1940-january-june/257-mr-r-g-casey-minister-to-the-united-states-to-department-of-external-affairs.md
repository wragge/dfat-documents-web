Cablegram 93 WASHINGTON, 20 May 1940,11.08 p.m.

I arranged some time ago short visit to Chicago, Minneapolis and Wisconsin and accepted invitation to speak. I would be away from Washington 23rd May to 28th May but always able to return in six to eight hours. My inclination was to abandon most if not an the visits but I am now told authoritatively that this would cause some resentment and that my visit and talks to prominent men may be very useful in an area until the last few days strongly isolationist and at present anxious and disturbed.

I propose, therefore, to carry on the programme unless further developments render imperative my presence in Washington.
