Cablegram 226 LONDON, 9 April 1940, 1.37 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

First news of German move against Norway and Denmark received here early this morning. Further information being received continuously. Position appears to be that Denmark occupied without resistance. Four German warships steaming up Oslo Fjord have been fired on by Norwegian batteries and attempted landing South Oslo Peninsula resisted. German warships have entered fjords at Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger with certain number of troops. Norwegian Government has moved to Lake Miosen and Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs [1] after informing United Kingdom Minister [2] that German warships approaching Oslo had been fired on stated 'So now we are at war'. Whole German fleet believed to be out and latest Admiralty report is that naval engagement now going on off Bergen.

Views here with regard to position conflict and I have difficulty in making up my mind whether German action against Norway is a dangerous gamble or a sound strategical move.
