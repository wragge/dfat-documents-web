Cablegram, Washington, 13 February 1951

216\. SECRET

I called on Berendsen today to obtain his comments on the visit by the New Zealand Prime Minister.[1]

Berendsen said that Mr. Holland had been very happy at his reception here. The following were the main points:

(1) His talks with Acheson had been of a very general nature and when Holland expressed wish to discuss a Pacific Pact, Acheson referred him to Dean Rusk who, Acheson said, exercised major responsibility in matters affecting the Far East.

(2) Rusk had, during discussion of the Pacific Pact, expressed views as to how membership could be limited. He made the suggestion of a Tripartite Arrangement between United States, Australia and New Zealand. Holland said he would have to consult his Cabinet on this.

(3) During the meeting with General Marshall, there had been an exchange of views regarding Japan and upon aspects of rearmament. Holland indicated that New Zealand would view with great concern any substantial rearmament that could constitute a danger to the security of the Pacific.
