Cablegram, Washington, 11 July 1951

1221\. EMERGENCY SECRET

Pacific Security Arrangements.

Your 800.[1]

We have just been informed by Satterthwaite that the President has approved the draft Security Treaty as it now stands. The treaty will be initialled between 1600 and 1700 hours Washington daylight saving time 12th July. New Zealand is anxious that release to the press should be held until 1830 hours Washington time in order to coincide with session of Parliament at 10.30 hours Wellington time. State Department will try to co-operate but cannot guarantee that the text will not become public once the document has been initialled.

 _1 11 July. It repeated to Washington the text of a cablegram from Casey to Doidge which conveyed the substance of Document 99 and indicated that the Australian Government was prepared to accept Dulles's revised text of Articles VII and VIII although it would have 'preferred the words 'in the Pacific area'to be omitted from the latter half of Article VIII. Casey indicated that he agreed with Spender's opinion that raising new points with the United States at that stage would make impracticable the initialling of the treaty at the same time as the Japanese Peace Treaty was published and might 'also lead to indefinite delay before initialling could take place'.
