Canberra, 9 November 1949

SECRET

Australian representatives in Pacific and South East Asian Countries are being recalled to Canberra for discussions on general political and economic problems of the area affecting Australia. It is proposed that the discussions should begin at the end of this week. Since questions in which your Department is particularly interested are likely to arise during the discussions, it would be useful if a representative of your Department could be available to take part in the discussions next Monday or Tuesday, 14th or 15th November. We shall communicate with you further as to exact times.

[NAA: A621,753]

1 J.W. Burton, Secretary, Department of External Affairs.

2 J.G. Crawford, Secretary, Department of Commerce and Agriculture.
