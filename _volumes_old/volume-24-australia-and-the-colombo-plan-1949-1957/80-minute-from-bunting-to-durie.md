(ii) A standing committee of External Affairs, Treasury and the Public Service Board to recommend to the Minister for External Affairs the terms and conditions of service of Australians employed by the Government for overseas service;

(iii) A more widely represented inter-departmental committee to advise the Minister on the programme of technical assistance and to review from time to time policy, in the field of international technical assistance generally, upon matters where departments other than the Department of External Affairs are concerned.

(g) The Department of External Affairs in its future public relations work should implement the recommendation of the meeting of the Consultative Committee publicity for the Development Programme and the Technical Assistance Scheme and regarding the encouragement of public support for them.

(h) A committee consisting of the Prime Minister and Ministers for the Treasury, External Affairs, Trade and Customs, Commerce and Agriculture, and National Development should examine the issues connected with the long-term development programme and the Australian delegation at the September meeting of the British Commonwealth Consultative Committee.
