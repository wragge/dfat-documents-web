 **Colombo Plan Aid to Thailand**

Thailand is not a member of the Colombo Plan although it has sent observers to meetings of the Consultative Committee and the Council for Technical Co-operation.

2\. Australia has, however, provided training facilities for eleven Thai students. The two latest arrivals in Australia are Messrs. Sote Jotikasthira and Visisdh Lueamrung who are undertaking a course in Trade Promotion. Messrs. Khongkhakul and Kulananan attended the recent Trade Promotion Seminar and returned home early in March. Seven other students have completed training.
