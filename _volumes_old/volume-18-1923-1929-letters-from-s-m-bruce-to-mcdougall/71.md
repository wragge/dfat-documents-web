12th May, 1926

Dear Mr. Bruce,

On December 14th [1] I wrote to you about my remuneration and I have not received any reply from you. Since I wrote there has been no change in the situation.

It is very distasteful to me to have to return to the subject but I should like to ask you to refer to my letter of that date. I cannot imagine that the Government regards my present remuneration as satisfactory and I am presuming that some alteration will be made.

Perhaps you may have in mind the consideration of my position when you are in this country. If this is the case I should like you to consider whether any adjustment should not be made retrospective.

It would be of immense satisfaction to me if I could hear from you on this subject.

Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL
