PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Mr. Bruce,

This is the fourth letter I have written to you by this mail.

My copy of 'Forward', the Scottish Labour paper, has just arrived and I feel sure you will like to see the statements made by Mr.

MacDonald [1] and by Mr. Wheatley [2] on the General Strike.

The contrast is vivid. Personally I prefer Wheatley's attitude to that of MacDonald. The latter appears to be trying to bluff both himself and his readers.

Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL 

_1 Ramsay MacDonald, Leader of the Labour Opposition.

2 John Wheatley, Labour M.P.; Minister of Health 1924.
