Kuala Lumpur, 29 July 1963

447\. Confidential

 **Malaysia**

Djatikasumo who returned from Djakarta on July 27th asked to see Tunku urgently. Tunku saw him yesterday morning but found he had nothing positive to say.[1](#f1) Razak told me last night that Djatikasumo had implied that Sukarno would demonstrate at the Summit that Malaysia was a British plot to protect British interests and _not_ in accord with the interests of the North Borneo people. He would also attack the Defence Agreement.

2\. The Malayans believe that irrespective of the results of the Summit they will have to expect trouble from Indonesia in the Borneo Territories. Razak thinks that the confrontation policy is dictated by internal problems and that Malaysia ‘will have to live with it’.

3\. Since there will be no meeting of Ministers, Razak will _not_ be going to Manila. Khaw Kai Boh[2](#f2) and Ghazali will accompany the Tunku. One reason for including former is that the Chinese are suspicious and the Socialist Front has been spreading reports that Maphilindo is ‘anti-Chinese’.
