Canberra, 14 September 1963

663\. Unclassified Immediate

Please convey following message from the Prime Minister to the Tunku:—

Begins:—

I offer you the warmest greetings of myself and my colleagues on the occasion of the coming into existence of Malaysia.[1](#f1)

We in Australia have expressed a clear and continuing conviction that the establishment of Malaysia would be a welcome and progressive development in the history of South East Asia. Events of this magnitude do not take place without frictions and hazards. You and the other representative leaders of the constituent elements of Malaysia have maintained your dedication and belief in what you believe to be best for your peoples. Now Malaysia has been brought into existence as a threat to none and a positive factor for stability and progress.

The contacts and associations between our Governments and peoples have been many and close. They have been marked by feelings of mutual good will and, on our part, by respect for and appreciation of your achievements in the few short years since independence. The main features which distinguish this performance—wise and tolerant government, free institutions, and policies of economic growth and social development—provide a good augury for the future of the new and wider Federation.

Ends.
