Canberra, 11 July 1963

754\. Secret Immediate

 **Malaysia**

Please see Subandrio as soon as possible explaining that on Minister’s instructions you are recalling that he gave a clear understanding that Indonesia could accept Malaysia in substance as a practical solution for the Borneo territories if as a result of discussions Indonesia’s national feasibilities and apprehensions about threats on her unity could be removed. In addition at Manila the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and the Philippines stated that they would welcome Malaysia if the support of the people of the Borneo Territories was ascertained by an independent and impartial authority. You should refer to reports of Sukarno’s statement on 10th July[2](#f2) saying that this seems to be an unqualified rejection of Malaysia, and a reversal of Indonesia’s position in terms which appear likely to cause resumption of acrimonious exchanges between Sukarno and the Tunku and seriously to prejudice the framework of co-operation established at Manila.

2\. You should express Minister’s concern and disappointment at this statement which appears to represent an official expression of Indonesian policy. Minister does not understand how such a statement has come to be made and would be grateful for some elucidation. The London agreement was no more than a necessary stage in the establishment of Malaysia and scope was provided at the summit meeting for further exchanges of views between Malaya, Indonesia and the Philippines.
