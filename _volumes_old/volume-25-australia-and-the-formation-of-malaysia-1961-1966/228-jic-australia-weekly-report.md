Canberra, 15 December 1964

 **Indonesia: Confrontation Activities**

During the past week the number of infiltrations by Indonesians into Malaya and Singapore has increased, but with small parties. Bases in the Riouw Islands have received some reinforcements; this is no doubt partly to replace troops who have been lost in previous landings in Malaya and Singapore. We do not believe it indicates a change in the size of infiltrations, which will still be carried out by small groups. It will, however, enable Indonesia to continue with infiltrations at the present rate.

On 9th December landings were made at Kukup and Semerah on the west coast of Johore. Seven of the Kukup group have been accounted for, and it is likely that a further eight are at large in this area. Five men have been accounted for out of the Semerah party of ten.

On 13th December an apparent attempt to infiltrate Indonesians into Singapore was prevented by HMAS Teal, when she intercepted two fast motor boats off Raffles Light. Three Indonesians were killed and four captured from one of the boats, the other boat escaped towards the Riouw Islands.

On 13th December HMS Ajax reported five boats, each capable of carrying ten men, moving at high speed towards Rupat Island. It is possible that these boats were returning after landing infiltration parties in the area between Cape Rachado and Port Swettenham. As yet there has been no public reaction from Indonesia to these incidents. Four Indonesians were arrested on 14th December in the Changi area of Singapore, shortly after landing.

During the week three incidents were reported in the Borneo territories. One occurred on 11th December in 1st Division, Sarawak,[1](#f1) with no casualties. On 10th December two incidents occurred in 4th Division near the Sabah border. In one of these an estimated 90 Indonesians took part, of whom four were possibly killed; security forces suffered two killed. No details are available regarding the second incident.

1  There were five administrative divisions in Sarawak—the 1st Division being that around Kuching and the 5th adjoining Sabah. The area around the junction of the 4th–5th divisional boundary and the Kalimantan border was close to the junction of the Sarawak–Sabah–Kalimantan borders.
