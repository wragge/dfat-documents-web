London, 7 May 1965

3613\. Secret

 **Malaysia**

In my talk with Bottomley[3](#f3) yesterday, I indicated that I was less optimistic about Lee’s willingness to refrain from pressing for ‘disengagement’ than he had appeared to be during his visit to Canberra.[4](#f4) I said I thought that a dangerous situation was developing on the constitutional situation. I indicated that it was my intention during my forthcoming visit to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore[5](#f5) to say whatever seemed possible or appropriate to both of them on the dangers of allowing present differences to worsen. Bottomley thought this would be very useful but he maintained his own optimistic interpretation.

2\. He said this was based on a talk he had had with Lee in Singapore[6](#f6) in which Lee had said he would accept British advice not to press for ‘disengagement’ provided the British were prepared to give him support and assistance if he proved right and things went badly for him. Bottomley did not say whether he had given him any promise but he did express conviction that Lee would honestly attempt to damp down the quarrel with Tunku.

3\. Bottomley said he had found a very different attitude in Kuala Lumpur. Tunku and Rahman[7](#f7) were both highly suspicious of Lee and could not be convinced that Lee had not deliberately sought to create mischief during his visit to Australia. Bottomley thought it would be useful for me to make a further effort to persuade the Tunku that this was not the case.

4\. I took the opportunity of recapitulating for Bottomley’s benefit the Australian Government’s view on the necessity for a total view of the problems of South East Asia and the need for continuous dialogue between United States, United Kingdom and ourselves. He said that he agreed wholeheartedly.

1 Hasluck had led the Australian delegation to the 1Oth Meeting of the Ministerial Council of SEATO, held in London 3–5 May, and had remained for talks with British officials.

2 Menzies was Acting Minister for External Affairs during Hasluck’s absence. As the Prime Minister was in Canberra at the time this cablegram was received, it can be presumed he was indisposed and that McEwen, as Acting Prime Minister, had also assumed the role of Acting Minister for External Affairs.

3 Arthur Bottomley, UK Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.

4 See Document 264.

5 On his return journey to Australia following the SEATO meeting, Hasluck again planned to visit Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.

6 Bottomley had visited Kuala Lumpur 23–25 April and then travelled to Singapore for talks with Lee before continuing his tour to Australia and New Zealand.

7 Presumably, ‘Razak’.
