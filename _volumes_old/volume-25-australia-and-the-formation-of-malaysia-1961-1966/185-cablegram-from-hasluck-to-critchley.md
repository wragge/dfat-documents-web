Canberra, 13 May 1964

497\. Secret

The Defence and Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee of Cabinet reviewed briefly last night the current discussions on the possibility of another meeting between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. We appreciate the need for Malaysia to appear before the world as peace-loving and reasonable but are more keenly aware of the traps that can be set. We would, therefore, wish to use our advice to assist Malaysia in analysing the possible dangers, seeing all the implications of each step and presenting their policy to advantage.

2\. We think the Tunku should stand firm on withdrawal of forces. In our understanding of the manner in which infiltrators are coming and going we would expect this requirement to cover not merely a condition that troops be withdrawn but that infiltration cease.

3\. Timing is important having in mind such separate considerations as military activity in Borneo, possible reference to United Nations and the attitude of the United States Administration. Our concern that the time should be propitious is another reason why we are unwilling to express outright a view in favour of talks. We should not oppose talks but try to ensure that they only take place at a time and under conditions that will not leave Malaysia at a disadvantage and that they will promote our main purpose of concerting all friendly forces in checking aggression throughout whole South-Eastern Asian region. This is a matter on which, knowing objectives of Government, you will use your own judgment in any conversations you may have on your own analysis of local circumstances.
