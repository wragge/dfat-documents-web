Canberra, 13 March 1963

165\. Confidential Immediate

Your 182[1](#f1) discussed with Critchley.[2](#f2)

He believes Tunku will be wary of multilateral discussions but could be prevailed on to agree to them so long as there was a clear proviso that Malaysia was not negotiable. He believes Razak could best propound the Malaysia concept.

2\. He sees no problem in persuading Malaya to offer assurances of non-interference in Indonesian affairs or of agreeing to discuss co-operation among the Malay peoples. Such discussions are in fact urgently needed.

3\. He sees no difficulty in reference of the Philippine claim to the International Court. Malaya has already told the British of their willingness to do this.

4\. Critchley believes he can stop Des Alwi broadcasting but that it would be against the Tunku’s nature and the whole concept of political asylum to expel Sumitro.

5\. There seems a good opportunity now as a result of your talks in Manila to send a personal message to the Tunku. You could tell him something of your discussions and stress that as it is he who is proposing to create a new state on the borders of Indonesia, the onus is on him to proffer explanations and particularly assurances to his neighbours. We doubt whether anyone at your level has put this to him squarely.

6\. There is obvious merit in the tripartite talks but we must keep in mind the Tunku’s own internal position and the danger to which he would be exposed if it appeared that he was being manoeuvred into a postponement of Malaysia.
