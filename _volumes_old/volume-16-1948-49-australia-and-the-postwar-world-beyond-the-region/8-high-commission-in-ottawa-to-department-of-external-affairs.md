Unofficially indicated by members Canadian Assembly delegation that delegation would support nomination of Dr. Evatt as President unless French candidate nominated in which case they anticipate election by acclamation. They indicate that only complicating factor in their minds is question whether British Commonwealth Conference would require Dr. Evatt's absence from Paris at difficult stage.
