Cablegram UN555 (extract), NEW YORK, 19 June 1948, 3.27 p.m.

SECRET

HUMAN RIGHTS 1. The Commission finished its session last evening, 18th June, with the adoption of draft International Declaration of Human Rights. The vote was twelve in favour with four abstentions (Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Byelorussia). The minority view which will be included in the report was that the declaration was 'weak and completely unacceptable' largely on the ground that it contained no 'effective measures to combat Fascism and Nazism' and refused to specify individuals' obligations to the state.

2\. The report which will go to the Economic and Social Council comprises also reference to covenant and implementation. As there was no discussion on the covenant the Commission is forwarding simply the text of covenant as submitted from the drafting committee.
