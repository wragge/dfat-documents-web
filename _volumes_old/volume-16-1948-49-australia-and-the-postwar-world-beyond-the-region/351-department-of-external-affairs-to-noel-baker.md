Cablegram 45, CANBERRA, 20 February 1948, 6.05 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your D.82 Italian Colonies.

In absence of full information regarding conditions in ex-Italian territories, which we had expected Commission of Investigation to provide, we find it impossible to offer any endorsement of or even comment[1] on assessment of situation outlined in your telegram under reference. Our position therefore remains unchanged.

 _[1] A number of draft replies setting out Australia's views were prepared but not sent.
