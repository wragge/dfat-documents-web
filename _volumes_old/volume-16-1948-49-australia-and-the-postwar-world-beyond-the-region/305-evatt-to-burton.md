Cablegram Austdel 208, PARIS, 12 November 1948, 9.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Recently the Assembly unanimously carried[1] a Mexican resolution requesting the great powers immediately to re-establish attempts to make peace. Since the failure of Security Council to settle the Berlin dispute, the Secretariat has been making an examination of the currency problems. It is essential that the United Nations resolution should be brought to the final attention of the great powers who have accepted the obligation to carry out the Assembly resolution and in conjunction with Lie, I propose, as President to address a communication to them all in the sense of the state in the Assembly after the resolution was carried - that it required a genuine attempt to have peace made and that therefore steps should be taken directly or through the United Nations to remove obstacles in the way of peace making such as the Berlin dispute in order to carry out the Mexican resolution. This is a case where it is essential to act in order to carry out the Assembly decision in letter and spirit.

 _[1] On 3 November 1948.
