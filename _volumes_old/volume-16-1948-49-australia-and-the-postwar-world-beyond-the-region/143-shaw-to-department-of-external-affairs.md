Jackson reports that Korean Commission resolved this morning the following - 'To observe the election announced by the Commanding-General, American Force, to be held May 9th, 1948, provided that the Commission has ascertained that the election will be held in a free atmosphere wherein the democratic right of freedom of speech, press and assembly will be recognised and respected'.

The resolution was proposed by France and amended by Syria from 'provided etc.'. Voting in favour was four to two with Canada and Australia against and Syria and France abstaining.
