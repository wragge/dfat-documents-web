Cablegram 146 (extract), PARIS, 30 October 1948

SECRET

3\. Reference your UNP.59. We have been working for the past week along lines of your suggestion but have found it impossible to get much support. Countries which are in general in sympathy such as New Zealand and India insist that some observation functions should be retained. These countries have been impressed by argument of United States that presence of U.N.S.C.O.B. observer groups on northern boundaries has been a deterrent to aid to guerrillas.
