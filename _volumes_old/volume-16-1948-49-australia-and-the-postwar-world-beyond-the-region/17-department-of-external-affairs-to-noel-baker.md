Cablegram 51, CANBERRA, 27 February 1948, 5.45 p.m.

TOP SECRET

We are extremely concerned at the way the Palestine situation is shaping and in particular at the way in which the Assembly decision is being undermined by the Arab States. We feel strongly that all treaty negotiations should depend on Arabs first showing willingness to support United Nations Decision on Palestine.

With special reference to your Saving telegram H.8 dated 16th February[1] we feel that it should be impressed upon the Egyptian Government that one of the conditions they must fulfil before a resumption of treaty negotiations is possible is that they should accept and support the Assembly decision.

Our telegram No. 40 dated 18th February also refers.

 _[1] It advised that the United Kingdom Government had instructed its representatives in the Arab states to inform Governments that recent activities of Arab states, such as the entry of armed bands into Palestine, might result in the United Kingdom denying them any military, political, economic or technical assistance.
