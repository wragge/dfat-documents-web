Cablegram UNP42, CANBERRA, 21 October 1948, 1.40 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your Austdel 91 paragraph 6. Fourth Committee.

As regards point (a) in paragraph 3 of our UNP5, whilst we consider that the final clause of the preamble clearly expresses our intention to preserve status of trust territory, you may mention that we have no objection to inclusion in Act itself of clause on lines suggested in paragraph 64 on page 30 of report to External Affairs of Australian representative on Trusteeship Council[1] copy of which you will have. Points (b) and (d) may also be used. We would however prefer that you do not mention point (c) at this stage.

 _[1] The clause reads: 'Nothing in this Act shall have the effect of extinguishing the juridical status and identity of New Guinea as a trusteeship territory.' The report is dated 12 August 1948.
