Cablegram 188, CANBERRA, 19 January 1948, 11.20 a.m.

SECRET

188\. Your 137. Marshall Aid.

We agree with Walker's suggestion that we should keep more directly in touch with proceedings under Marshall Aid proposals. We should be pleased, therefore, if you would take the matter up with United Kingdom authorities, and discuss possible facilities which might be accorded. Perhaps the appointment of an Australian observer would be the most satisfactory method.

Please pass copy to Walker.
