Cablegram 33, CANBERRA, 11 May 1948, 5.45 p.m.

Your 45.[1]

We agree that contact must, as a first step be made with the Northern Governments. It seems unlikely however that they could now agree to receive the Committee or its representatives without reversing a publicly announced condemnation of the Special Committee and its activities.

It appears that the only means open to us of making contact is by a personal visit of an Australian representative to each of the three governments. We would hope to explain our conception of the Special Committee's functions and endeavour to persuade Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to a more conciliatory attitude.

Any talks which might be held with the Northern Governments should have no formal connection with the Special Committee but Committee should be advised in advance of intention. Please advise immediately your comments on such a proposal.
