Cablegram 31, CANBERRA, 7 October 1948, 4.35 p.m.

SECRET

Greece.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in an appreciation in telegram H. No. 237 of 16th September of Soviet intentions and tactics in Greece has given the opinion that 'only when the threat from the North has ceased can Greece settle down to a progressive political and economic programme. It is in order to prevent social progress and reform that the Communists keep Greece in a state of armed ferment even after it is clear that they cannot seize power there'.

In a previous approach to the Commonwealth Relations Office we expressed the view that internal reform was essential to the re-establishment of order within Greece, since in our opinion social progress coupled with an effective truce was the best means of eliminating support for Communist doctrines.[1]

It is suggested that this view might be conveyed again to United Kingdom representatives before the Greek issue comes up for discussion in the Political and Security Committee.
