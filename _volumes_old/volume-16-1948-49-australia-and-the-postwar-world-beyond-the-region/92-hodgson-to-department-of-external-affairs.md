Cablegram 56, SALONIKA[1], 1 May 1948, 1.20 p.m.

SECRET

April 29th.

Am following strong policy along the lines of conversations with the Minister and Secretary and during this week will press for definite action on frontier conventions and personal approach to the Northern Governments. Have had conversations with all personalities and find amongst some a defeatist attitude in fixed belief that nothing useful can be done. Some of the principal delegates have left permanently leaving alternates. All the principal delegates left here, except that of France are going to Geneva for short session of Drafting Committee, but will return to Salonica after six weeks.

As I feel it essential that we should be represented on the Drafting Committee, Glasheen will be leaving next week for Geneva.
