Cablegram UN388 (extract), NEW YORK, 3 May 1948, 9.52 p.m.

Palestine.

First Committee today heard some final comments on United States Trusteeship Plan from Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and four or five other Delegations. Cuba and Greece stated they would support Trusteeship.

2\. Main statement was from United Kingdom which strongly emphasised the need for some unifying neutral control authority to be installed on 15th May. Such an authority would not necessarily take over the whole control administration many parts of which were already transferred in fact to Jewish and to a less extent Arab local authorities. It would, however, help to coordinate administration and would also act as receiver for Palestine Government assets which would otherwise risk being dispersed. This arrangement would not be trusteeship which would find no acceptance by either of the parties in Palestine but it should be without prejudice to ultimate political settlement.
