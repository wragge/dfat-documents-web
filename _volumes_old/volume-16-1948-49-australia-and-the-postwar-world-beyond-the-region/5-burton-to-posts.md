Cablegrams 136, 218, 97, 67, CANBERRA, 14 August 1948

United Nations General Assembly. Minister has been approached by a number of countries to stand for presidency General Assembly which opens in Paris on 21st September and his chances of securing fairly wide general support seem bright. Please raise with the Chinese, Indian, Pakistan and Siamese Governments the possibility of their support in this matter, pointing out that Dr. Evatt was narrowly defeated at the last Assembly and that it would be reasonable to expect that, the position having been held by Europe and South American countries to date, South East Asia - Pacific should receive recognition on this occasion. You can hint that Australia will give favourable consideration to desires of the Chinese Pakistan and Indian and Siamese Governments in other elections to be taking place. They might be standing for any other post. Your approach should be on a personal, confidential and informal basis. Please report result.
