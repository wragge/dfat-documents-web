SECRET

HUMAN RIGHTS DRAFTING COMMITTEE[1] 1. The United Kingdom proposes following additional wording to Article 13 of declaration 'married persons shall have the right to reside together in any country from which they cannot be lawfully excluded'. This is aimed at Soviet policy on wives but may affect our policy on Japanese wives and Malays. Please advise whether we should support.

2\. Christian Science Monitor 1st May carries lengthy article that United Malay Nationals' Organisation has directed letter to Human Rights Commission concerning deportation by Australia of fourteen Malays.[2] Would appreciate statement of facts and background before May 20th.

 _[1] The drafting committee met from 3-21 May 1948.

[2] On deportation see Volume 14, Document 158 and note 1 thereto.
