Cablegram 2675, LONDON, 9 August 1948, 6.45 p.m.

SECRET

After further reflection on all circumstances suggest you consider approach along following lines.

(1) Gesture in paragraph 15 of your 2915[1] might take form of sharing sterling area contribution to other countries under clearing scheme which would likely involve grants but may include credits. Our contribution would be dual benefit to both Britain and others. A grant if practicable would be more effective.

(2) Figure indicated in your paragraph 15 would be useful but suggest you consider increase if Britain's contribution is substantial.

(3) If this idea appeals it should come as a spontaneous gesture and be sounded out with British Authorities as to form, effect and time.

(4) This method is a matter between us and Britain but would help later approach under your paragraph 9(c).

Above message was radioed from 'Queen Mary' to Nimmo in London.

 _[1] Document 343 was repeated to McFarlane in London as cablegram 2915.
