Cablegram Austdel 242 (extract), PARIS, 17 November 1948

SECRET

First Committee 17th November, 1948. Palestine.

United Kingdom called British Commonwealth meeting before First Committee met today and stated that their policy would be to support Bernadotte proposals. Their attitude was opposed by Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and ourselves who all prefer supporting 29th November resolution as starting point. McNeil, however, made it clear that United Kingdom Government could not contemplate this course. India expressed open mind and Pakistan the Arab case. McNeil was not able to give any indication of United States view although he hinted that they were coming round to Bernadotte approach. This we regard as unlikely.
