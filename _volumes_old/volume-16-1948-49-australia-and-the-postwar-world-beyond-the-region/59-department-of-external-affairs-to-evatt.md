Cablegram E92, CANBERRA, 9 November 1948, 4.05 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

Reference 3948 from London repeated 17 to Delegation Paris.

We assume you are in touch with United Kingdom authorities and there is no need to send telegram from here reiterating our view that it would be most unfortunate if the United Kingdom were to lift arms embargo on Palestine. Prime Minister is much against even considering further relief until others do as much as we have already done and lifting of embargo would prejudice relief from any source.
