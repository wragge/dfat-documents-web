Cablegram Austdel 219, PARIS, 15 November 1948, 6.15 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

BERLIN QUESTION Action by Minister and Lie was taken in their official capacity on implementation of the Assembly resolution regarding Four Power co-operation and on the whole the reactions of Delegations in the Assembly is quite favourable. Of course the difficulties are enormous but the Assembly work in every quarter is still being clogged by existing tension and it seems quite possible that new action may be taken in the Security Council towards solution of Berlin problem as a result of this appeal. At present it appears that it cannot result in anything but good for the United Nations as a whole.
