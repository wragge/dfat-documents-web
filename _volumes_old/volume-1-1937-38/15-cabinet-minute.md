Minute 1368 CANBERRA, 9 March 1937

YAMPI SOUND IRON DEPOSITS

Reference was made to the fact that Japan, through an English company, was now almost ready to proceed with the exploitation of the iron at Yampi Sound. It was stated that the Commonwealth would not prohibit the export of iron ore, but that in the meantime the Prime Minister [1] and Senator McLachlan [2] will have a survey made to collect information regarding the iron deposits throughout Australia.
