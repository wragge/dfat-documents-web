Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 7 November 1938, 6.14 p.m.

PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF SECRET

Since our telephone conversation [1] I have exhaustively discussed with the First Lord of the Admiralty [2] the question of a capital ship in Eastern waters and have put forward a formal request that the British Government should give to Australia a private undertaking that as soon as the King George class begins to come to hand a capital ship will be allocated to Eastern waters and should be available for and should spend a reasonable amount of time in Australian waters.

Present position is that the matter is now under consideration at the Admiralty and the First Lord has promised a reply within the next few days. [3]

BRUCE
