Cablegram 106 26 October 1938,

SECRET

Commonwealth Government strongly of opinion that, as a contribution to peace, Anglo-Italian agreement should be brought into operation forthwith and de jure recognition accorded to Italian Empire in Abyssinia. Italian withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Spain seems a real contribution and in present condition of world, a peaceful and friendly Mediterranean is in our opinion essential. To refuse de jure recognition seems to us to ignore the facts and to risk danger for a matter which is now immaterial. [1]
