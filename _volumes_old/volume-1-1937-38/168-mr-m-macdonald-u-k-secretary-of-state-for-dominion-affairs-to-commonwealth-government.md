Circular Cablegram B83 LONDON, 25 March 1938

CONFIDENTIAL

My telegram of 25th March Circular B 82. [1] It is proposed in the course of a few days to inform the German Government that it is our intention to replace our legation at Vienna by a Consulate- General and to ask for an exequatur [2] for the new Consul- General.

It will be understood that such a note to the German Government would be interpreted as constituting an act (and supplying the date) of formal recognition by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich.

1 Document 167.

2 An exequatur is the official recognition of a consul or commercial agent by the government of the country to which he is accredited, authorising him to exercise his functions.
