Memorandum S.3897 LONDON, n.d. [after 22 May 1937]

The first part of this memorandum did not relate to the Pacific Pact proposal.

4\. The Ambassador at Nanking [1] now reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs [2] seems reassured as to the possible effect of Anglo-Japanese conversations on Chinese interests; he realises that these conversations can not have proceeded very far. As for the proposal for a Pacific pact, the Minister doubted whether the material, though plentiful, was of a kind which would admit of embodiment in anything formal.
