Cablegram 167 LONDON, 24 September 1938

German memorandum of Dominions Office telegram Number 265 [2] great advance on Hider's letter, Dominions Office telegram Number 259 [3], in tone and substance particularly by inclusion of date 1st. October. Pending information from Prime Minister [4] and examination no conclusion can be formed but atmosphere for the moment distinctly more hopeful.

1 According to the Department of External Affairs inward cablegram register this cablegram was not received until 26 September 1938 but it seems more likely that it arrived on 25 September.

3 The text of Hitler's letter was in fact given in circular cablegram B263 of 24 September 1938, not printed (See AA : A981, Czechoslovakia 18, ii). The letter stated that it was impossible for Germany to refrain from giving 'immediate protection' to the Sudetenland, although she would allow a plebiscite to be held under international control.
