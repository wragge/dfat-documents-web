Repeated to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 28 September 1938

At this late hour I venture to suggest that there may be some possibility of averting war by personal appeal to Signor Mussolini. I can think of no other individual who might be able to influence Herr Hitler towards peaceful solution. If Bruce, our High Commissioner in London, could be of any service to you by flying to Rome bearing personal message from you to Signor Mussolini you may of course regard him as available and I am cabling him urgently to this effect. I suggest Bruce because, as Prime Minister of Australia, am on good personal terms with Signor Mussolini.

J. A. LYONS Prime Minister
