SECRET

Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister. [1]

Much obliged for your message in your telegram No. 112 [2] October 28th. Present idea is that the matter should be debated in the House of Commons here in the afternoon of Wednesday November 2nd.

I should speak early probably between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and should hope in the course of my speech to refer to your telegram No. 106.

[3] Should be a great help if you would keep this proposed procedure confidential for the time being.
