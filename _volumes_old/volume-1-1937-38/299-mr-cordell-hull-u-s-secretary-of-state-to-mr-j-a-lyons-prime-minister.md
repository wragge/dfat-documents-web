Cablegram unnumbered WASHINGTON, 4 October 1938

The President [1] has asked me to tell you how grateful he is for your telegram of September 28 [2] which arrived at a time when we were all doing what we could to contribute toward a peaceful solution of the crisis which was then threatening the peace of Europe. It is his hope, and he feels assured that it is your own, that the principles governing peaceful and orderly international relations and their sound application should continue to have the unstinting support of all Governments and peoples. The President wishes you to accept his most sincere thanks and the assurances of his highest personal regard and consideration. [3]
