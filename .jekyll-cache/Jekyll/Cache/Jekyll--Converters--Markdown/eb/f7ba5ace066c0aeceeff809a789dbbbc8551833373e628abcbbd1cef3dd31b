I"q<p>Cablegram UN280 NEW YORK, 17 July 1946</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>1. Your 3. Walker must be available for Peace Conference especially in early stages and preliminary discussions. Maybe he can do London work through deputy.</p>

<p>2. Please ask Walker to prepare papers and cases on economic problems especially reparations and economic effects of proposed territorial changes. My own feeling is that to extract huge reparations will cause resurgence political fascism while being of little or no value to victors.</p>

<p>3. Please show Walker this cable.</p>
