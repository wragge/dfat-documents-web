<p>URGENT</p>

<p>This morning the New York Times contained as front page news unofficial but authoritative report from Melbourne of the appointment of Casey. [1] As the State Department may feel that we have not respected their desire to have advance advice of announcement so that they could make similar announcement here I would be glad to be in a position to explain.</p>

<p>OFFICER</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development, who was to be Minister to the United States.</p>
