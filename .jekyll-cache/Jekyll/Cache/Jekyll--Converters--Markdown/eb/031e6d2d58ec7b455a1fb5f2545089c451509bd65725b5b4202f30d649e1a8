<p>PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>1. Summary of provisional agenda for Canberra Conference may be sent to other British Commonwealth Countries attending, but should contain no cross-reference in them to Australian policy papers or other Australian documents. Following two subjects should be added to the list:</p>

<p>(a) Compensation for prisoners of war, internees, and relatives of those killed or ill-treated by the Japanese [1], breach of practices of war and humanity;</p>

<p>(b) Protection of civil rights within Japan and within those territories to be taken from Japan.</p>

<p>2. Outline notes on the agenda should not be circulated to other countries but should be circulated for Cabinet after my return and in provisional way to New Zealand [2] in confidence. In effect they constitute notes for conference and it might be wise to circulate them or something like them during very early stage of Commonwealth Conference. (Comments on outline notes will follow from ship.)</p>
