<p>Your 201. [1]</p>

<p>Your views were put to the United Kingdom authorities yesterday afternoon and last night instructions were settled for Cadogan suggesting certain amendments to the American draft resolution [2] copy of which was received yesterday. My impression is that though United Kingdom Government will support a resolution along the lines of the American resolution they have not instructed Cadogan to go as far as we think necessary. I understand that Cadoganâ€™s instructions, though they refer to detailed points in the American resolution, are not categorical and he is given some discretion.</p>
