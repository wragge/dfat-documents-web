<p>SECRET</p>

<p>With reference to your telegram 35 [1], Brazilian Foreign Minister is absent for a few days. I have however seen Minister Camillo de Oliveira in charge of Political Division of Foreign Office. He is in communication with Foreign Minister and has promised a decision tomorrow. His reaction is highly favourable. He thinks that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will immediately instruct the Brazilian Representative on the Security Council and also ask him to bespeak support of Representative of Colombia. Please instruct me whether you desire me to approach Ambassador of Colombia in Rio de Janeiro and to request him to communicate with his Government.</p>
