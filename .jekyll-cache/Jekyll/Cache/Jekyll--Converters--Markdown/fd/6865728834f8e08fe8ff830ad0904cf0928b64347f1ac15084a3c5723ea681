I"Ì<p>Cablegram 81 [1] CANBERRA, 26 January 1942</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister [2] from the Prime Minister. [3]</p>

<p>With further reference to my telegram 74 [4] it is noted from cablegram No. 45 from the New Zealand Government [5], which has been repeated to us, that reference is made to Dominion membership of the United Kingdom War Cabinet â€˜as this is in effect accorded to Australiaâ€™.</p>

<p>2. We are, of course, unaware of the terms of your communication to New Zealand, but we wish it to be quite clear that our request in cablegram No. 68 [6] implied and meant full membership of the United Kingdom War Cabinet with all rights and privileges unless and until an Imperial War Cabinet is constituted.</p>

<p>3. We would be glad of early answer on Pacific Council scheme and note that New Zealand Government seems to be in substantial agreement with us.</p>

<p>FORDE</p>
