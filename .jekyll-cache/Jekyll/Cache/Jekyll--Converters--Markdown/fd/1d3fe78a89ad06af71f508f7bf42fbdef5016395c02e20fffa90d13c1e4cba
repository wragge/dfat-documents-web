<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>I was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1430 hours [Saturday] [1] and was handed by the Political Director a memorandum on the decision of the Netherlands Government â€˜to authorize the high representative of the crown to take without any further delay such measures as he considers necessary to re- establish conditions of peace and security in the whole of Indonesiaâ€™.</p>

<p>2. Boon stated that the memorandum in question had not been prepared until 1300 hours and that I was the first representative of â€˜friendly powersâ€™ to receive copy. Dutch are now transmitting the memorandum to the Committee of Good Offices and Teppema.</p>

<p>3. He described the memorandum as self-explanatory but added that cabinetâ€™s decision was unanimous and while it had been reached with great regret it was regarded by the Government as representing the feeling of the Dutch people as a whole.</p>

<p>4. My immediately following telegram summarizes arguments set forth in memorandum.</p>
