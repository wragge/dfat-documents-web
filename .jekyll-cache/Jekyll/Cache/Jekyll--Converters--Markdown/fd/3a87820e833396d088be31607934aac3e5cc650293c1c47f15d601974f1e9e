<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Italy. In personal conversation with Loraine [1] Ciano [2] left no doubt of imminent war. Loraine adds that his guess is within a week. My telegram No. 376 [3]: grounds of detention of Italian ships will be exercise of contraband control. If ships convoyed detention will be carried out by force if any interference attempted.</p>

<p>Reports from Spain indicate growing hostility against England and Hoare [4] telegraphed his opinion that Spain will follow Italy if the latter enters the war, owing to Francoâ€™s [5] belief in Mussoliniâ€™s judgment. Nevertheless strong volume of opinion in Spain will remain neutral.</p>
