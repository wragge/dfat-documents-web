<p>Cablegram 27 LONDON, 11 January 1940, 6.27 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram No. 9. [1] In view of strong reaction by Norway to</p>

<p>communication (Dominions Office No. 7) [2] and change of attitude</p>

<p>by Sweden, who now strongly opposed, stopping of Narvik iron ore</p>

<p>supplies being re-examined by Cabinet. Following are material</p>

<p>points for consideration. Stoppage of supplies from Narvik the</p>

<p>only port of shipment from the northern field for the next four</p>

<p>months no doubt troublesome but probably not really serious to</p>

<p>Germany. Unless possible to stop shipment from Lulea when that</p>

<p>port reopens action against Narvik would be of relatively small</p>

<p>value.</p>

<p>In addition following have to be borne in mind.</p>

<p>(1) Would cause bitter resentment in Norway and Sweden.</p>

<p>(2) Would conceivably lead Norway to feel compelled, in order to</p>

<p>protect her neutrality, to resist by force our action in her</p>

<p>territorial waters.</p>

<p>(3) Would antagonise opinion in neutral countries particularly the</p>

<p>United States with its large Scandinavian population.</p>

<p>(4) Would afford a pretext of some appearance of justification for</p>

<p>Germany either to take armed action against Sweden or to take her</p>

<p>under German protection.</p>

<p>Because of relative ineffectiveness and political and military</p>

<p>consequences, wisdom of action against Narvik supplies at the</p>

<p>moment would appear doubtful. So much importance attached here to</p>

<p>cutting off German supplies of Swedish iron ore that serious</p>

<p>consideration being given to the question of bringing Sweden into</p>

<p>the war on the Alliesâ€™ side.</p>

<p>Prime Minister [3] strongly urged that before attempting to do</p>

<p>this either by provoking Germany to attack or inducing Sweden to</p>

<p>declare war, we must be certain that the United Kingdom and France</p>

<p>are in a position to render sufficient aid to prevent Germans from</p>

<p>overrunning Sweden.</p>

<p>I have also urged that in considering the question of what aid</p>

<p>could be given to Sweden the possibility of a move by Germany</p>

<p>and/or Russia in the Danubian and Balkan countries, necessitating</p>

<p>the United Kingdom and France establishing an eastern front with</p>

<p>further drain on man power, supplies and shipping, must not be</p>

<p>overlooked.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
