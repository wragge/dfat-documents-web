<p>MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Matters have moved with great speed here and I send you the text of the sub-joined agreement which had been reached between the President [2] and myself with the approval of His Majestyâ€™s Government. The President is sure that the Dutch will agree. I trust that I may receive the assent of your Cabinet to these arrangements designed largely for your interest and safety. The President and the American staffs regard this decision as of the utmost urgency. The initiative has come from them and the President proposes to state publicly that the appointment of General Wavell [3] has been at his direct suggestion, endorsed by his advisers. It is desired to make public statement by 1st January at the latest.</p>

<p>The text of the agreement is contained in my immediately following telegram. [4]</p>
