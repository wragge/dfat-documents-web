<p>MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Following from the Prime Minister [1] for the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The following are proposals for machinery in London to secure full and continuous association of Australian, New Zealand and Netherlands Governments with the whole conduct of the war against Japan. A Far Eastern Council shall be established on Ministerial plane. I would preside and other members would be the Lord Privy Seal [2] (who is my deputy on the Defence Committee), Duff Cooper [3] and representatives of Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The Australian member would presumably be Earle Page [4] and the New Zealand representative might be the High Commissioner [5] to begin with. There would also be a Dutch Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>The Council would be assisted by a staff group of Dominion liaison officers in consultation with the United Kingdom Joint Planners.</p>

<p>The duties of the Council will be to focus and formulate views of the represented powers to the President [6], whose views will also be brought before the Council. This will not, of course, interfere with Earle Pageâ€™s attending Cabinet as at present when Australian affairs are affected. Do you agree? Am also consulting Fraser [7] and the Netherlands Government.</p>
