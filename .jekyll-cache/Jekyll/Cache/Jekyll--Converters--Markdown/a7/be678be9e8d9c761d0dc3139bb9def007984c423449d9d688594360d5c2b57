<p>1 The relevant excerpt of the communiquÃ© reads as follows: â€˜The greater part of [the Conference] has been spent in a comprehensive review of the current problems of South-East Asia both political and economic. It was recognised that in the changing conditions brought about by recent developments in this area, progress depends mainly on the improvement of economic conditions. The Conference was impressed by the magnitude of the contribution which the success of progressive policies in this area could make to the peace and prosperity of the world. Executive decisions are not taken at Commonwealth meetings of this kind; but, as a result of the valuable exchange of views which has taken place, recommendations for the furtherance of economic development in South and South-East Asia will be submitted to Commonwealth Governments for their consideration. These recommendations include a proposal for the establishment of a Consultative Committee representing Commonwealth Governments. The Australian Delegation proposed that the first meeting of this Committee, when set up, should be held in Australiaâ€™.

<p>2 The Havana Charter for the International Trade Organisation was adopted at the UN Conference on Trade and Employment which was held in Cuba, 1947. The Charter never entered into force.</p>
