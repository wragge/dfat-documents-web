<p>TOP SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Your telegram 492.</p>

<p>1. With great respect I regret to state that your telegram appears to fail to appreciate the circumstances in which I sent you my earlier telegram and also fails to appreciate my feelings and convictions about Dr. Evattâ€™s course of conduct before and during his visit to Japan.</p>

<p>2. If I may venture to say so I believe there are two essential issues:</p>

<p>(a) Whether you and your Government are prepared to continue to accept responsibility for Dr. Evattâ€™s behaviour as Minister for External Affairs. This is a political question on which it would be improper for me to express an opinion so long as I am an official of your Government.</p>

<p>(b) Whether your Government desire to show elementary decency to its officers. For sixteen months I have held an island post and carried out my duties faithfully with what abilities I may possess. During Dr. Evattâ€™s visit to Japan he appeared to lose no opportunity to disown and humiliate me. In my view Dr. Evattâ€™s public statements are carefully calculated to obscure rather than explain the actual course he is taking. His visit was the kind that only a spineless stooge could conceivably tolerate.</p>

<p>3. In paragraphs 2 and 3 of your telegram you appear to imply that it is of little consequence whether I attend the Canberra Conference or carry on here until it is convenient for you to replace me. I am afraid you misunderstand my attitude. May I restate it. I gave Dr. Evatt my resignation. Since I had some sense of obligation to the Australian Government and if I may say so a deep personal regard for yourself, I felt that I should make no immediate announcement of my resignation and should be prepared to carry on for some weeks if you personally desired it.</p>

<p>4. In the present circumstances I propose to announce my resignation on 16th August and to decline to attend the Canberra Conference.</p>

<p>5. I greatly regret that it is under these circumstances that I must take my leave of your Governmentâ€™s Service.</p>

<p>6. I should be grateful for your earliest advice of instructions regarding replacement.</p>
