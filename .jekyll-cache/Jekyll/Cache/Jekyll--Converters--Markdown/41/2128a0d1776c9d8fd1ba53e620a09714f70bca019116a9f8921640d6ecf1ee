<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL</p>

<p>High Commissioner for South Africa [1], with whom I have discussed the question of approach to Roosevelt, and who is in agreement with the views expressed in my telegram No. 344 [2], has put similar Suggestion to Smuts. [3]</p>

<p>Question whether Mr. Mackenzie King [4] should also be approached requires consideration.</p>

<p>Resolution introduced into Congress by Senator Pepper that Government should sell to the Allies war planes now in possession of United States Army and Navy shows American opinion moving in right direction.</p>

<p>Please insert following in my telegram No. 344 before last Paragraph- ‘The suggestions above as to possible future war developments are of course not a forecast of what I believe will happen but are only an appreciation of possibilities which we would be unwise to ignore’.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
