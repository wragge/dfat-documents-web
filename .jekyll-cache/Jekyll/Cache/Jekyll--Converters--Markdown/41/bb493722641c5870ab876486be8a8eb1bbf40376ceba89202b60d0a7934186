<p>PERSONAL MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Japanese Mandates. Reference your U.N. 183.</p>

<p>Soviet change of front indicates attempt to appease on a matter which is only one of procedure made to gain advantages elsewhere.</p>

<p>2. Your telegram shows need for close co-operation with United Kingdom in statement to be made to Security Council.</p>

<p>3. In the circumstances, matter should be considered with Cadogan and, if possible, one should agree upon actual terms of statement to be made by him.</p>

<p>4. This also confirms substance of my suggestions over â€˜phone.</p>
