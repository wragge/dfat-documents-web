<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 18th November, H. No. 458. [2] Indonesia.</p>

<p>You will have seen the communique issued by the Dutch Government on November 20th announcing the departure of a delegation to Indonesia to continue with the Republicans the negotiations for an interim federal government which were initiated by Mr. Stikker early this month.</p>

<p>2. Our information is that Mr. Stikker (who has had to overcome considerable opposition in the Dutch Cabinet to his policy) considers that the two outstanding points of difference with the Republicans during the interim period are the disposal of the Republican Army and the Supreme Command of the Federal Armed Forces. On the former point no policy envisaging embodiment of Republican Army as a whole or even in complete units in federal forces could be acceptable to the Dutch, on the latter point we understand that Mr. Stikker while prepared to go some way to meet the Republicans (e.g. by creation of joint staff) is unable to consider yielding on the main point of ultimate responsibility for command. He has requested us and the United States Government to use our good offices with the Republicans in the hope of arranging some accommodation on these points. We have given discretion to His Majestyâ€™s Consul General at Batavia to approach the Republican authorities accordingly.</p>
