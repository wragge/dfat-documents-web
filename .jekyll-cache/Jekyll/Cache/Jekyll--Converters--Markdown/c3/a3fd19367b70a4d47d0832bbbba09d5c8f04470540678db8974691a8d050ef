<p>2. This was a great tribute to Australia as almost every member outside Latin America voted for the Minister and he was defeated only by the casting vote of the Russian bloc. The Minister was offered the presidency of the Political Committee and would certainly have been elected if he had stood. However, he declined as he felt he could work more effectively as a national representative.</p>

<p>3. The following Committee Chairman were elected:</p>

<p>Political Bech of Luxembourg Economic Santa Cruz of Chile Social Lange of Poland Trusteeship Berendsen of New Zealand Administrative Fazle Ali of India and Legal El Khouri of Syria.</p>
