I"‹<p>Letter 232 LONDON, 28 December 1940</p>

<p>I have the honour to state that, following on the recognition of the Provisional Czechoslovak Government established in London, an enquiry has been received from that Government as to what steps should be taken to regularize the position of their consular representatives in the Dominions.</p>

<p>2. It is thought that it would be advantageous if, both as regards Czechoslovak consular representatives already functioning in the Dominions and officers who may be appointed to the Dominions in future, such appointments could form the subject of an official notification through the diplomatic channel, with a request for formal recognition, which would be referred to the Dominion Government concerned in accordance with the normal procedure in the case of foreign consular officers.</p>

<p>3. I should be glad to learn whether His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia concur in a communication being addressed to the Provisional Czechoslovak Government in this sense, so far as Australia is concerned.</p>
