<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your Dept. 204 and 205 [1] and memorandum 196. [2]</p>

<p>We are instructing our FEC representative to make firm protest at next meeting of FEC on 22nd April along the following lines:-</p>

<p>(a) Bill, which appears to conflict with FEC basic policy and disarmament policy, has been presented to Japanese Diet with cognizance of SCAR (b) We consider this a matter of substance which should have been referred to the Allied Council for Japan under paragraph 5 of its terms [of] reference.</p>

<p>(c) Articles 4, 19, 20 and 35 of the Bill appear to require revision in order to bring them in line with FEC policies.</p>

<p>Although SCAP has authority under paragraph 8 of FEC 017/20 to use former disarmed Japanese naval craft we consider that this is a question on which he could well have consulted the Allied Council for Japan as it is direct implementation of an FEC policy decision. [3]</p>

<p>2. Please raise this formally with the Chairman of the Allied Council and endeavour:-</p>

<p>(a) to delay publication of ordinance (Article 34) pending discussion in FEC, and (b) to have matter discussed at next meeting of Allied Council.</p>
