<p>SECRET</p>

<p>The Dutch Government are enquiring as to the possibility of supplying Munitions to the Dutch East Indies. No official enquiry has been made but I understand that this is likely to be forthcoming shortly. Their enquiry covers the whole range of armament stores in general but in particular light and heavy A.A.</p>

<p>guns, A.T. guns, rifles and machine guns and ammunition. They would consider British patterns. They are interested in long range policy rather than the question of immediate supply and if you consider it worthwhile, the Dutch Government will probably suggest sending small military mission to Australia to investigate. In view of your present commitments, request advice if any likelihood of being able to supply. Dutch Minister in London [1] is aware of pooling arrangements and that we are informing the Ministry of Supply of this enquiry.</p>
