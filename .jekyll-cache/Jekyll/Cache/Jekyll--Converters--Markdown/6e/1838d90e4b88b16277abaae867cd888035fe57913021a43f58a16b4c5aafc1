<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Assembly 5.</p>

<p>Voting for the Security Council commenced this morning. Motion for the adjournment by Gromyko failed to obtain support although Fraser took the opportunity of drawing attention to article 23 and emphatically presenting case for representation of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Although no formal nominations were made Australiaâ€™s name was prominently before the meeting and the whole delegation worked assiduously up to the moment of polling. The first vote resulted as follows:-</p>

<p>Brazil 47, Egypt 45, Mexico 45, Poland 39, Netherlands 37, Canada 33, Australia 28. Several other nations received handful of votes.</p>

<p>First five having obtained two thirds majority were declared elected and the chairman announced that a further ballot would be taken solely between Canada and Australia to fill the sixth place, two thirds of vote cast being required for successful candidate.</p>

<p>In the second vote Australia obtained 27 and Canada 23. Further vote is therefore required and will be taken immediately after the luncheon adjournment. We are still working hard and hope to pick up further support.</p>

<p>Apart from the heavy vote for Australia voting on the first ballot was in accordance with slates previously agreed upon by all the permanent members except Russia and by the majority of the Regional groups, and apart from advancing our own claims to a seat we feel we have already gained a success in breaking through this system of private arrangements made outside the assembly.

<p>1 A second ballot saw Australia receive 28 votes and Canada 13.</p>

<p>Canada then withdrew, and Australia was elected to a two-year term on the Security Council. Australia received very little support (only seven votes) in elections for the Economic and Social Council and failed to achieve membership.</p>
