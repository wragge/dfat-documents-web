<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Following for Maloney from Evatt. Your telegram 176. [1]</p>

<p>1. We have instructed High Commissioner to inform the United Kingdom Government of receipt of Note from Peoples Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, that we propose, subject to any comments which United Kingdom Government may wish to offer, to inform both Polish and Soviet Governments that we now regard our duties as Protecting Power as at an end, and finally, that the business arising out of this representation will be terminated in proper form as soon as it can be wound up. [2] It is most important that you make clear that, animated by a warm admiration for the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Poland alike, Australia has based its policy in this matter all along on the desire to promote the common interests of the United Nations.</p>

<p>2. We are also informing both the United Kingdom and United States Governments that it is to be assumed, in view of all the current relief questions and cases being dealt with by the Legation, that it will take time before affairs can be wound up, and that for administrative convenience close contact may be necessary, even if informally, between the Legation and the representatives of the Polish Committee of National Liberation in Moscow.</p>

<p>3. In the circumstances you should formally acknowledge the Soviet Note, point out Australiaâ€™s disinterestedness in the matter, but await further instructions before taking up with the Soviet Authorities any other questions arising from the new situation.</p>
