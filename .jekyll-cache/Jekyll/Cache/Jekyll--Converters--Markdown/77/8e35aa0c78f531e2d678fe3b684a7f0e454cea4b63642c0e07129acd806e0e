<p>Begins.</p>

<p>1. Your functions in Greece should centre solely round the activities of UNSCOB[2] and should in no way be concerned with work of conciliation committee which it is expected will continue its work in New York when Assembly reconvenes.</p>

<p>2. In connection with UNSCOB Minister has already instructed (appropriate) authorities to issue a suitable statement on this committee. You should endeavour ensure that agreement of committee continues in terms of resolutions adopted at 2nd and 3rd sessions of Assembly.</p>

<p>3. You should continually endeavour to restrain reactionary policy of Greek Government. It is clear that Greek Governmentâ€™s ultimate chances of survival will depend on liberalisation of its domestic policy.</p>

<p>4. Please avoid any statements without advice from here. Ends.</p>

<p>_[1] Sent via Paris.</p>
