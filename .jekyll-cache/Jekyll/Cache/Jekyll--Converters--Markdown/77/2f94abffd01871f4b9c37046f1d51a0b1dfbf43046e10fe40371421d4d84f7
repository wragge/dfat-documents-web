<p>Cablegram 3769 [1],</p>

<p>MOST SECRET &amp; IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>CANBERRA, 16 July 1941</p>

<p>Following for the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. [2]</p>

<p>Reference your M.151. [3]</p>

<p>We have given careful consideration to your views but we are not</p>

<p>convinced that your proposed course of action is correct.</p>

<p>In paragraph (2) you refer to denunciation as something which</p>

<p>would â€˜afford unmistakable evidence of our reactionsâ€™ and again</p>

<p>that â€˜the psychological effects on Japan would be greatâ€™.</p>

<p>At the same time, in paragraph (3), you appear to accept the</p>

<p>Canadian view that denunciation should not be represented as a</p>

<p>reprisal and that it should be based on commercial grounds. We</p>

<p>cannot reconcile these two things.</p>

<p>We think that the denunciation would plainly be regarded by all</p>

<p>parties as a reprisal and as a pretty ineffective one. We see no</p>

<p>value in economic measures against Japan which are merely</p>

<p>pinpricks and do not exercise a material influence upon Japanese</p>

<p>economy, and through it Japanese policy. That is why we suggested</p>

<p>that if economic action was envisaged as reprisal it should take</p>

<p>the form of severe restrictions on imports from Japan by all</p>

<p>countries. Such action would, on our latest information, fit in</p>

<p>very well with what the U.S.A. proposes to do in the same event.</p>

<p>If and when Japan makes anticipated move into Indo-China, whether</p>

<p>such move be with or without the concurrence of Vichy, then</p>

<p>following steps would in our opinion be appropriate:-</p>

<p>(a) Immediate denunciation of Treaty [4] without attempt at</p>

<p>justification on commercial grounds;</p>

<p>(b) The denunciation to be followed as quickly as possible by</p>

<p>intensified import and export restrictions or complete economic</p>

<p>embargo subject in either case to the United States being prepared</p>

<p>to act concurrently with us.</p>

<p>We would of course be most happy to consider any further argument</p>

<p>you might care to advance but frankly we are not convinced by</p>

<p>those adduced in the cable under reply.</p>

<p>15 July on file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i) had urged a â€˜most</p>

<p>immediate replyâ€™ from the Commonwealth Govt on the course of</p>
