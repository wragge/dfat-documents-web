I"µ<p>Note (extract) WASHINGTON, 7 February, 1949</p>

<p>The United States Government regrets that the Australian Government has not found it possible to retain in Japan a British Commonwealth Force equivalent to one United States infantry division (less one regimental combat team) plus necessary service troops, as requested in this Departmentâ€™s notes to you of July 8, 1948, and November 3, 1948. Information received from General MacArthur indicates that United States Army units have been obliged to assume responsibility for certain areas and functions previously assigned to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.</p>
