I"R<p>Cablegram 359 LONDON, 25 September 1940, 9.46 a.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 495 21st September. [1]</p>

<p>We are not altogether clear as to the position with regard to DUMONT D’URVILLE, since recent messages from Sautot [2] to General De Gaulle [3] through the Commonwealth Naval Board imply that the Captain of this ship [4] is being interned or deported.</p>

<p>2. Subject to clarification on this point, we feel that it would be desirable to immobilise both French ships because- (1) they might go to Tahiti or the New Hebrides if given sufficient oil to reach Saigon.</p>

<p>(2) Whilst they are at large it might be necessary to retain H.M.A.S. ADELAIDE at Noumea.</p>

<p>3. For this purpose and in accordance with the United Kingdom Government’s policy (my circular telegram D.459 [5]) with which it is hoped the Commonwealth Government is in agreement, the United Kingdom Government feel that force should be used as a last resource to immobilise these ships. [6]</p>

<p>4. The United Kingdom Government agree with your view that the present operations off the west coast of Africa are relevant. Any drastic action by Vichy Government in that connection during the next day or two might of course necessitate the use of force against the French sloops.</p>
