<p>After lengthy negotiations with representatives of Oil Search Ltd, Minister of Colonies [1] has informed the Commercial Secretary [2] that he is prepared to grant concession for area lying either east or west meridian 126. Minister maintained that Wittouck [3] has moral rights which he cannot disregard and affirms that if Wittouck is indemnified he will grant whole area to Oil Search.</p>

<p>Minister appears adamant on the question of Wittouck’s ‘moral rights’.</p>

<p>I have also pressed Minister of Colonies personally, but in vain.</p>

<p>Minister seems to be under an obligation to the Belgian Government, whose representative here has throughout vigorously supported Wittouck’s claim. Please inform me as a last resource [sic] whether you are prepared to accept either area.</p>

<p>1 Dr F.J.V. Machado.</p>

<p>2 A.H.W. King.</p>

<p>3 Serge F. Wittouck, Managing Director of the Asia Investment Company.</p>
