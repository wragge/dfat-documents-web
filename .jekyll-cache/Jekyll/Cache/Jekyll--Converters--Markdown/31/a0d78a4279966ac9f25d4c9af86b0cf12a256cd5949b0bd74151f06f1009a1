I"?<p>Cablegram 507 LONDON, 3 July 1940, 8 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>I am most disturbed at the lack of information supplied when</p>

<p>advising you in Dominions Office telegram No. 22.8 [1] of complete</p>

<p>reversal of the United Kingdom Government’s naval policy in the</p>

<p>Far East and asking you to undertake the serious commitment of</p>

<p>sending a division to Malaya.</p>

<p>I have told the United Kingdom Government that personally I would</p>

<p>flatly refuse to entertain their request unless I received a great</p>

<p>deal more information as to United Kingdom appreciation of the</p>

<p>situation resulting from French collapse and of their plans and</p>

<p>strategy for the future conduct of the war.</p>

<p>In view of the attitude I have taken suggest that possibly the</p>

<p>wisest course for you would be masterly inactivity for two or</p>

<p>three days. If during that period I can get no satisfaction I feel</p>

<p>that it will be necessary for you to send a strong cable to the</p>

<p>Prime Minister [2] as it is essential that the United Kingdom</p>

<p>Government should be [stunned] [3] by someone into facing the</p>

<p>great and fundamental issues that now confront us, which in my</p>

<p>view they are not doing.</p>
