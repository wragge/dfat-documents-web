I"2<p>Canberra, 18 June 1951</p>

<ol>
  <li>RESTRICTED IMMEDIATE</li>
</ol>

<p>At previous meetings of the Council of Technical Co-operation at Colombo, the representative of the Government of Ceylon has been appointed President not only in recognition of his experience and qualities but also as a courtesy to the Government of Ceylon. It was agreed last year that President would be elected for a 6 months’ period; the present President’s term accordingly expired on June 1st last.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As the Council will presumably continue to meet in Colombo, we agree that it would now be appropriate to provide for periodic rotations of President, and we are authorising Critchley to accept nomination and to stand for this office at the forthcoming meeting on June 25th.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please approach informally the Government to which you are accredited, advising them that on the assumption that the Council decides to rotate the residency, we hope they may be able to support Critchley.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
