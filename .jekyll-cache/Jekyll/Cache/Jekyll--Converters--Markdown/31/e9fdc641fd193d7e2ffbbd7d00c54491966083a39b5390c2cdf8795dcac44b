<p>Indonesia. Your 912. [1]</p>

<p>1. Indonesian representative advises that his delegation in Paris have received several cables from Djokjakarta warning of â€˜grave danger that military action will be renewed very shortlyâ€™.</p>

<p>2. State Department discounts these reports although Lacy said today U.S. periodically warns Netherlands of inadvisability of further police action.</p>

<p>3. Cochran apparently has forwarded little information on substance of Hatta and Stikker conversations. He has reported, however, that the two leaders got on well personally and that some measure of agreement seems to have been reached. State Department anticipate some development following Dutch cabinet meeting yesterday. In the light of this hopeful development State Department considers police action unlikely at the present time.</p>
