<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>My immediately following telegram contains text of final statement on Commonwealth consultation submitted by meeting for endorsement by all Governments. We tried hard to get recommendation published but South Africa and Canada prevented this, arguing that premature publication would tend to preclude adoption of recommendations.</p>

<p>Accordingly communique is very inadequate on the question of consultation.</p>

<p>I would suggest early approval of plan by Cabinet and there is no reason why you should not show the substance of recommendations to such Opposition Leaders as you think fit.</p>
