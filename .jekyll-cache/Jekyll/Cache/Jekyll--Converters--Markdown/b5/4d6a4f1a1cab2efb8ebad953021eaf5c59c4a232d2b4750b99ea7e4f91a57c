I"<p>Cablegram 563 [1] CANBERRA, 26 April 1944</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>To Mr. Beasley from Dr. Evatt.</p>

<p>Your reports 4 [2] and 5. [3]</p>

<p>(1) It does not appear likely that Government delegates can sign an employment agreement at present I.L.O. conference when not so authorised by their Governments. I assume the United States delegates want decide the general principles of an agreement to be recommended to Governments for subsequent consideration. I agree we should not oppose their wish but on the contrary do everything to further such a recommendation suggesting- (A) That I.L.O. take some part in machinery for implementing agreement and (B) That lead is due to Australian Government.</p>

<p>(2) My statement [4] tonight followed criticism by Menzies [5] that you were taking steps independent of, and unauthorised by, Australian Government.</p>

<p>(3) My Press statement is contained in my immediately following telegram.</p>

<p>(4) Please make full use of my statement.</p>

<p>(5) You are doing a very good job-you can’t have an omelette without breaking eggs.</p>

<p>Nash wants very close watching as he is an uncertain friend to Australia.</p>
