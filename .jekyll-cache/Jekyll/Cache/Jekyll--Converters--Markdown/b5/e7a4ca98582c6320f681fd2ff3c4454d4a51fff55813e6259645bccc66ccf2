<p>1. Aide-memoire received from State Department today of which following are main points begins:-</p>

<p>(A) Message received from S.C.A.P. states that after consideration of opposing views advanced by Australian and other interested Governments he has nevertheless been compelled in the circumstances to authorise third expedition. Reasons the same as necessitating previous expeditions.</p>

<p>(C) Reference Australian contention that Japanese Antarctic whaling properly a matter of principle to be decided by F.E.C.:</p>

<p>the position of the United States has already been made clear in connection with previous expeditions. It is the view of the United States Government that S.C.A.P. has authority under provisions of F.E.C.035, or under his general powers as ‘sole executive authority for Allied Powers in Japan’.</p>
