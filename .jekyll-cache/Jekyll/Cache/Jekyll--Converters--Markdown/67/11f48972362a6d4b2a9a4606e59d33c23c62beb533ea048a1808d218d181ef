I"¸<p>Cablegram 1043 [1] CANBERRA, 15 July 1944</p>

<p>Following for Melville from Minister for External Affairs and Treasurer.</p>

<p>Your Financial 15. [2]</p>

<p>We attach great importance to securing acceptance by United Kingdom and United States representatives of a resolution of the kind you have proposed. [3] It would also have good psychological effect here in considering monetary proposals as a whole. If amendments retain international duty to take such measures as are necessary to maintain high level of employment it would seem that substance of your draft would be maintained.</p>

<p>You should, however, refer here any amendments for approval before acceptance and in any case you should not sign resolution until final instructions are received on question of signing monetary documents.</p>
