<p>For External Affairs from Ross. [1]</p>

<p>Since occupation Dilli have been close prisoner in house which has been looted by Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>For three months have been half starved owing lack of food for sale Dilli and refusal Japanese allow servants search for food in surrounding country. Japanese suggest I might convey to Australian Company guarantee of proper treatment (â€¦) [2] prisoners in event of surrender. I agreed to convey this suggestion. I did not give any indication that I would return Dilli, but merely said that I would write and give the reply of the Australian Company. I do not intend returning for imprisonment in Dilli and am writing to Japanese to give reply that Australians will not surrender.</p>

<p>Do you want me to return to Australia if possible, or shall I become a fugitive and remain in this territory in hope that Japanese might evacuate Dilli. Cipher books have been destroyed.</p>

<p>Ends.</p>
