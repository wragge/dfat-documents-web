<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 88-Indonesia. [1]</p>

<p>The Indonesian reply was published this morning. [2] It has no doubt been reported in the Australian press and I will send a copy by next bag.</p>

Although the Dutch describe it as ‘disappointing’ and showing a desire to hang [3], it appears at first sight to be anything but a negative reply but, on the contrary, to provide a basis on which working arrangements could be built if the Dutch have necessary suppleness, and forget for once their dependence on strict juristic terms.</p>

<p>3. It seems that the intended United Kingdom and the United States of America representations at Djokjakarta were late or not made at all, respectively [4], but it is hoped both will now urge on both parties the need for patient negotiations.</p>
