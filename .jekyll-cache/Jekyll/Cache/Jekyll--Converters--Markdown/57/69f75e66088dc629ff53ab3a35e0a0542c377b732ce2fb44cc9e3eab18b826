<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>TIMOR. Following is the latest information from secret source. On 17th April the Japanese Minister at Lisbon [2] reported to the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs [3] that â€˜as an expression of welcome to Japanâ€™s co-operation in the development of Timor the Colonial Minister [4] offered:</p>

<p>(1) The development of mineral resources throughout the island with the exception of oil.</p>

<p>(2) The inauguration of sea route to Timor.</p>

<p>(3) To establish an air route to Timor, and he requested Japanâ€™s views on the above.â€™ The Japanese Minister continued: â€˜I replied I had recently sent an enquiry to my Government on these matters and should soon receive a reply. Please expedite reply.â€™ You will remember that last year there was a rumour that the Japanese were pressing the Portuguese to give them an air base in Timor and both the Portuguese Ambassador in London [5] and the Portuguese Government categorically denied that the Japanese had done so.</p>
