<p>Secret</p>

<p><strong>Trade with Communist China</strong></p>

<p>I spoke to Mr Phillips (Assistant Secretary, Department of Trade) along the lines set out in Mr Tangeâ€™s minute of 19th October, in which he said the following:â€”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Please pursue discussions with Trade Department in the light of the Ministerâ€™s reactions; the fundamental issuesâ€”and probabilitiesâ€”involved; the half-way house (Hong Kong) suggested as a pragmatic start (and some facility for their people to come to Australia); the Ministerâ€™s intention to try to condition the Americans with thinking straight on the subject of trade.</p>

  <p>â€˜The point should be put plainly to Trade that talking blithely about â€œan Australian Government Trade Commissionerâ€ begs questions which are not diplomatic floss but fundamental in our External relations.â€™</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Minsterâ€™s reaction was that he was opposed at this stage to the appointment of an Australian Government Trade Commissioner in Peking.</p>

<p>2. Mr Phillips asked whether External Affairs would be prepared to join in drafting a submission to Cabinet on this subject. I said that if the Department of Trade went ahead on the lines that I had just set out, we would co-operate in drafting it. If, however, Trade persisted with the idea of appointing a Trade Commissioner in Peking, we would have to make a separate submission to Cabinet.</p>

<p>3. Phillips said that in the light of what I had said, he did not think that Trade would want to proceed at present with the appointment of a Trade Commissioner in Peking. He said he would get in touch with us again later.</p>
