<p>Your D.227. Palestine The proposal for the establishment by the Secretary-General of an ad hoc Committee on Palestine, while it might appear to be a time saving device, raises several difficulties. We consider it would be bad tactics and be a great blow to British prestige.</p>

<p>2. The Charter confers no power on the Secretary-General to summon such a committee as proposed by the United Kingdom. The scope of the Secretary-Generalâ€™s powers is clearly set out in Chapter XV of the Charter. Accordingly, if a committee were formed in the manner suggested its status could be challenged at the General Assembly.</p>

<p>In addition, the United Kingdom scheme provides no machinery for determining the proposed Committeeâ€™s terms of reference, powers, composition and procedure, particularly to whom and how it makes its report and recommendations.</p>

<p>3. We believe that if the matter is to go to the Assembly, the Assembly itself should appoint a fact-finding committee to take evidence from all interested parties, organisations and individuals and to report back while the Assembly is in session.</p>

<p>On the basis of the report the General Assembly could then make a decision.</p>

<p>4. The only alternative to this would be to place matter before Security Council under Article 35 which could report to Assembly when a course of action had been decided upon.</p>
