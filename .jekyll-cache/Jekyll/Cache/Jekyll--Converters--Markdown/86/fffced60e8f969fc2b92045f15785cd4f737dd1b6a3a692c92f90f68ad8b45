It decided that by an administrative direction (if that is sufficient) or by statutory provision, the arrangements previously applying to relations with Singapore as part of the former Malaysia should be maintained until such time as the status of Singapore is determined and the new arrangements are worked out.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>
