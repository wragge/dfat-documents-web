<p>KOREA At a meeting on 10th February, Australia was elected Chairman of the Commission for the first month. I shall, therefore, deliver an address at the public meeting of the commission on Saturday 12th February. Australia, India and Syria appointed members of the Sub-Commission to explore means of implementing 4 (b) of the Assembly resolution and make immediate contact with North Korea. At the public meeting of 12th February, I propose to appeal strongly for help from Korea throughout the peninsular to avert civil war and establish contact.</p>
