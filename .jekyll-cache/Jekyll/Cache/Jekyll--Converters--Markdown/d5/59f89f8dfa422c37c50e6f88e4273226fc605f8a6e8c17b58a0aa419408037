<p>986. Confidential Priority</p>

<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>The large Malaysian party, and the relatively smaller group led by Malik, left this morning by Malaysian and Indonesian aircraft respectively for the two-day return visit to Kuala Lumpur.<a href="#f1">1</a> The bonhomie at the airport reflected the warm atmosphere which surrounded the functions yesterday, including the formal signing of the Bangkok Agreement at noon, discussions with the leaders of Parliament, a traditional â€˜thanks givingâ€™ dinner party given by Malik and six holes of golf between Razak and Soeharto. Soeharto seemed pleased when Razak assured me this morning that Soeharto had been too good for him at golf; indeed I have not seen Soeharto more relaxed than he was with Razak throughout this morningâ€™s ceremonies.</p>

<p>2. The Japanese Ambassador has a story that Sukarno was only barely polite to Razak yesterday but a contributing reason could have been that the Malaysian party was almost two hours late in arriving from Kuala Lumpur. According to one of the Malaysian party the Soekamo call was entirely formal in nature.</p>

<p>3. The â€˜secretâ€™ letter of understanding so far remains unrevealed but it would be surprising if it stays that way long. At least some of the press have an idea of what has occurred. Malik was summoned at short notice on Wednesday to tell Parliament what was happening and he told me that part of his explanation had involved telling Parliament of the existence of the secret letter. I notice that already one of the Parliamentary leaders in this morningâ€™s press has made a reference to the â€˜clarificationsâ€™ which have been given in respect of Article 2 of the Bangkok Agreement. The way of course is also open for Sukarno to disclose the secret letter whenever he feels it suits him best.</p>

<p>4. There is also doubt about whether any further ratification is required by Parliament. Some officials yesterday thought ratification was necessary, but Malik told us this morning this was not so and that following his explanations on Wednesday Parliamentâ€™s needs were fully satisfied.</p>
