I" <p>Cablegram K215 BATAVIA, 20 December 1948</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Following Dutch announcement last night (19th December) of the capture of Djokjakarta, Schuurman informed Cochran and me that the town fell between one and three p.m. and that nearly all Republican leaders including Sukarno, Hatta, Sjahrir, Hadji Salim and Pringgodigdo are in Dutch hands. He said that Dutch casualties included only one killed and that only one building in the town was destroyed.</p>

<p>2. Schuurman has arranged for De Ranitz to fly to Djokjakarta this morning to arrange personally for evacuation of Good Offices Committee personnel to Batavia by Dutch military aircraft. He hopes that this will be accomplished by Tuesday night.</p>
