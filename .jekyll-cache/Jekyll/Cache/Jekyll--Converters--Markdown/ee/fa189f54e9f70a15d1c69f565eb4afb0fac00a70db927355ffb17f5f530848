<p>1 Usmanâ€™s telegram was addressed to Chifley at Canberra. The Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, E. W. Tonkin, replied on 24 July that Chifley was in Queensland, but that Usmanâ€™s message would be brought to his notice as early as possible. A copy was referred to the Department of External Affairs that same day.</p>
