<p>PERSONAL FOR COLONEL HODGSON MOST SECRET</p>

<p>High Commissioner [1] has obtained the following from the British authorities:</p>

<p>‘It has been learned from an entirely reliable source that the Japanese Foreign Office have instructed their Consul General at Sydney [2], in regard to his negotiations for the purchase of Australian wool, at once to endeavour [to] obtain before the Anglo-Australian Agreement [3] has been concluded, the quantities required by Japan. His instructions as to the line to be taken in these discussions are:</p>

<p>(a) that re-sale of wool is out of the question. As to re-sale of woollen goods Consul General is not, in view of Japanese policy of nonintervention in the European war, to volunteer a guarantee that woollen goods will not be exported to Germany or Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>But, if Australian Government affirm that such a guarantee is a necessary condition for sale of wool, he is to reply on lines that Japanese Government is forced to accept.</p>

<p>(b) He is to say greater part is for military use and he can add minimum requirement for this purpose is about one hundred thousand bales merino one hundred thousand of miscellaneous wool.</p>

<p>(c) The Consul General is to remember the desirability, from Japanese viewpoint, of avoiding transfer of negotiations to London.’</p>
