<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL HIMSELF</p>

<p>Prime Minister [1] has gone to Paris following request for British troops, tanks, anti-tank guns and air support, taking the Lord Privy Seal [2] on account of contacts with Blum [3] and other Socialists to discuss position. Request for troops in my view not so much to increase fighting strength as because of effect on French morale.</p>

<p>NARVIK. Possibility that Norway will have to be evacuated has to be visualized. Such action could not have other than bad psychological effect, but I do not believe the strain of maintaining effort in men, aeroplanes, shipping and immobilizing strong naval forces (some 27 destroyers are at Narvik) can be kept up.</p>
