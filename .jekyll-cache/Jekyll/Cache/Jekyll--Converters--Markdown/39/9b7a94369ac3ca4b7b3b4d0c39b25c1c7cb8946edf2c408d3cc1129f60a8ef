<p><strong>Colombo Plan Finance</strong></p>

<p>I have received your letter of the 9th January, 1951, enclosing an aide-memoire on the subject of financing the Colombo Plan.<a href="#f1">1</a> I shall, of course, transmit this aide-memoire to Canberra where it will receive the fullest consideration.</p>

<p>I note in paragraph 8 of the aide-memoire your suggestion that the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand ought to aim, together, to provide external finance of the order of Â£450,000,000. While it is, of course, most important that we should do our best to close the â€˜gapâ€™ between the contributions already promised by Commonwealth countries and the figure you indicate, I am sure you will agree that the contributions made by each of us must be related not only to the â€˜gapâ€™ but also to our available resources in the light of our existing commitments and budgetary difficulties. I am a little surprised that neither Canada nor New Zealand has, as yet, indicated its intention of making any contribution, and I should be glad to learn whether the United Kingdom Government has been in touch with them on this subject.</p>

<p>You will, no doubt, be aware o f the fact that, since the war, Australian contributions for overseas relief programmes have been very substantial. These include contributions to U.N.R.R.A., the International Childrensâ€™ Emergency Fund, and relief for refugees from Palestine. Recently, the Commonwealth Government also agreed to contribute its full proportionate share towards a large relief and rehabilitation programme in Korea.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, I am not in a position at the present time to promise that the Australian contribution to Colombo Plan Finance can be increased. I shall look into the matter carefully, however, and let you know as soon as practicable whether there is anything more that we can do.</p>
