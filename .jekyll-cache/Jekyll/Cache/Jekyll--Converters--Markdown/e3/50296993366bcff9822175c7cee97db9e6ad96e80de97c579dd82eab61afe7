<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Since I spoke to you this afternoon I have received your telegram No.1. [1] Although we have not as yet received any direct invitation to attend we are considering the position in detail particularly as it affects the United Nations. As I mentioned during the course of our discussion this afternoon [2] I agree with your view that if we accept the invitation we should be represented by officials as observers. The position would be different however if the United Kingdom and the United States were also invited. I will endeavour to let you have my considered views by cable tomorrow.</p>
