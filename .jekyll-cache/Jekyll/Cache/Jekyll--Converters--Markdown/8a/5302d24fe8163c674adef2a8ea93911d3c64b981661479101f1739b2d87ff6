<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>In discussing recent developments in Manila you should make the following points:â€”</p>

<p>(a) Australia has not sought and does not desire the role of mediator. She has, however, friendly relations with Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaya and the Minister has been actively seeking to persuade all three parties to clear up mutual suspicions and misunderstandings in the interests of the peace and stability of the area.</p>

<p>(b) The Philippine proposal for exploratory talks between Malaya, Indonesia and the Philippines at the official level was made after clearance by the Malayan and Indonesian Embassies in Manila and we believe it is a useful start in the process of removing misconceptions and promoting understanding.</p>

<p>(c) The purpose of the talks would not be to delay or frustrate Malaysia; they would lay a basis for future co-operation between these three countries.</p>

<p>(d) We hope these talks will be continued at the Ministerial level but would not at this stage favour a â€˜summitâ€™ meeting which in the present state of tension would be likely to create more difficulties than it could solve.</p>
