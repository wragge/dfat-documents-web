<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>JAPANESE WHALING</p>

<p>Position as disclosed in F.E.C.239 [1] and 242 [2] is most unsatisfactory. I understand you were absent from Washington when my telegram 1326 [3] arrived. Please take up matter again personally with State Department emphasizing its importance to Australia and unsatisfactory nature of their reply. You should indicate that Australia may find it necessary to raise the matter in F.E.C. and/or Allied Council for Japan.</p>

<p>Assume you are in close touch with New Zealand and United Kingdom representatives.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 30 September. It advised that whaling ships would fly a modified international flag and that S.C.A.P. would welcome Allied inspectors on factory ships, in addition to S.C.A.P.</p>

<p>inspector, but that accommodation dictated a limit of three non- Japanese on each vessel. MacArthur had not yet advised about other Allied personnel for the expedition.</p>
