<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister. Begins-</p>

<p>My telegram Circular D.1085, 10th December. [1]</p>

<p>On December 16th, immediately upon his return from Africa,</p>

<p>President Roosevelt received the Chinese and Turkish Ambassadors</p>

<p>[2], the Egyptian Minister [3] and the Soviet [4] and Persian [5]</p>

<p>First Secretaries, in the absence of their chiefs, and His</p>

<p>Majestyâ€™s United Kingdom Minister at Washington [6] (His Majestyâ€™s</p>

<p>United Kingdom Ambassador being indisposed) and made the following</p>

<p>statement, warning them that they must not repeat to anyone what</p>

<p>he said.</p>

<p>2. He had been working very hard to prevent Indo-China from being</p>

<p>restored to France, which during the last 100 years had done</p>

<p>nothing for the Indo-Chinese people under their care. The latter</p>

<p>were still as poor and as uneducated as they had ever been and</p>

<p>this state of affairs could not be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>3. He thought that the Indo-Chinese who were not yet ready for</p>

<p>elective institutions of their own should be placed under some</p>

<p>United Nations Trusteeship which should take them towards the</p>

<p>stage when they could govern themselves, somewhat after the manner</p>

<p>of developments in the Philippines (the President did not make it</p>

<p>clear whether he was thinking of a United Nations Trusteeship for</p>

<p>all peoples in this category or whether the administration should</p>

<p>be in the hands of a single country or of all or several of the</p>

<p>United Nations).</p>

<p>4. The President went on to say â€˜weâ€™ would have great trouble over</p>

<p>this with the French, but that nevertheless it would have to be</p>

<p>done. At the recent meetings it had been decided that peace must</p>

<p>be kept by force. There was no other way and world policemen would</p>

<p>be necessary who would need certain places from which to exercise</p>

<p>their function without bringing up the question of changes in</p>

<p>sovereignty. He men tioned Dakar, which in the hands of a country</p>

<p>too weak to defend it or of a hostile country, constituted an</p>

<p>immediate threat to the whole of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>5. The President referred, with pleasure, to the decision taken</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>Chiang Kai Shek [7] in Cairo that Manchuria, Formosa and</p>

<p>Pescadores should revert to China. (See my telegram Circular</p>

<p>D.1046 of 1st December.) [8] Korea, he said, would have to be</p>

<p>prepared for an elective government under a form of trusteeship,</p>

<p>while Japan would be com pressed into her own islands and would</p>

<p>receive various forms of treatment which would prevent her</p>

<p>becoming a danger again. See my immediately following telegram.</p>
