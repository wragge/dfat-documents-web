<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram. [1] Following is the declaration:-</p>

<p>‚ÄòThe position of Siam is in some respects unique in the Far East, though not without parallel in Europe. A country with a long tradition of friendship with us has, though admittedly under pressure from Japan, betrayed that friendship. Not content with collaboration with our enemy and despite her treaty of non- aggression with us, the Quisling. Government of Luang Pibul [2] took the initiative in declaring war upon us.</p>

<p>‚ÄòFor these acts Siam is already paying the price and will undoubtedly pay a yet heavier price as the war reaches her territories. It is still possible for the people of Siam to do something to save themselves from the worst consequences of their betrayal, and they will be judged by their efforts which they make to redeem themselves from the position in which the action of their present regime has placed them. Like other countries in like cases ‚Äúthey must work their passage home‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄòIf they do so they can look to this country to support the emergence of a free and independent Siam after the war is over.‚Äô</p>
