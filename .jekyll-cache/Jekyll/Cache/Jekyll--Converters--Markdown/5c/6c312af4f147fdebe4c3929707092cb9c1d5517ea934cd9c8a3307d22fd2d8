I"|<p>Cablegram unnumbered 3 June 1940,</p>

<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I send our greetings to the French Republic. This is the hour of danger for all of us who love freedom and who believe that the well-being of the individual is the chief purpose of Government. Australia has watched with sympathy and pride, the struggle of the French people to resist a barbarous invader whose plans must be overthrown if France is to be free and if the democratic world is to survive.</p>

<p>Our people are stirred. Our young men are everywhere flocking to the colours. All that we have we pledge to victory. Your own inspiring leadership, the valour of your soldiers, the fortitude of your people-these things lit by the burning spirit of France will stir the world and lead to victory.</p>

<p>R. G. MENZIES</p>
