<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Fourth Session E.C.A.F.E. Indonesia.</p>

<p>Thank you for your telegram No. 189. Without having seen your proposed resolution, we fear that it would not obviate the protracted dispute which we are seeking at all costs to avoid.</p>

<p>Advice which we have had concerning views of other member governments has confirmed our opinion that having regard to present state of negotiations between Netherlands and Republican Governments the best course will be to postpone entire question of Indonesian associate membership. United Kingdom and United States Governments will not resist postponement, and Netherlands Government will seek to have this done. If this is accepted, no question will arise of either Netherlands or Republican Governments gaining an advantage over the other. Our delegation will discuss matter further with your representatives at Lapstone.</p>
