<p>My telegram of 31st May. [1] From the conversation I have had with the Minister for Colonies [2] I consider it important that we should proceed with the exchange of notes with the Portuguese Government for the establishment of the air service without delay.</p>

<p>When may I expect from you the draft text of the note you would wish me to exchange.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen his hands to resist possible Japanese application the Minister for Colonies suggests that you should apply for exclusive rights for the service.</p>

<p>We could attempt this if you think it expedient although I do not know as yet whether the Minister for Colonies reflects the views of his Government.</p>
