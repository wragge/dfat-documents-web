I"Õ<p>Cablegram 789 [1] CANBERRA, 11 December 1941</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In our 714 of November 4th [2] in discussing the notification that we should resist Japanese attack on Russia we also suggested endeavour to obtain reciprocal guarantee from Russia that if Japan attacked southward Russia would declare war on Japan.</p>

<p>Subsequently on December 2nd (our telegram 768 [3]) we repeated suggestion of seeking such guarantee from Russia.</p>

<p>Only answer we have received to our suggestion is Sir Earle Pageâ€™s [4] statement (December 4th) that, after discussion, your War Cabinet considered- (1) United States would need to be consulted.</p>

<p>(2) Eden [5] felt sure that Russia was not yet prepared to give such reciprocal aid.</p>

<p>We think time has now arrived to make earnest attempt to obtain Russiaâ€™s intervention. Our Legation, Chungking, states (December 9th) [6] that Chinese Government proposes anti-aggression bloc and military alliance between U.S.A., Great Britain, China, British Dominions and Netherlands. This idea may be capable of at least partial application.</p>

<p>Our Ministers, Washington, Chungking, are receiving copy of this message and we earnestly request its prompt consideration by War Cabinet and United States Government.</p>
