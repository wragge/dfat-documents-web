<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>My telegram 61. [1]</p>

<p>I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and spoke on the lines of your telegram 38. [2]</p>

<p>2. The Minister listened carefully and took notes. He took, as I expected, the line that delays were due to Republicans rather than the Dutch and repeated his former assurances that the Dutch wanted and were determined to have a free Indonesia, but could not agree to the Republic dictating the lines on which it was to be established.</p>

<p>3. He denied that there was a blockade or anything more than proper measures to prevent smuggling. I pressed him for specific details of controls and regulations and some assurance that channels of trade would be freed.</p>

<p>4. I gave him a note, the contents of your telegram 39. [3] He appeared friendl[il]y disposed to the enterprise but said it was being discussed with Batavia (apparently on the basis of report from Teppema).</p>

<p>5. Finally the Minister said he would like to consider my representations and send for me for a further discussion in a few days time.</p>

<p>6. After leaving the Minister I saw Secretary General and repeated my represen-tations to him.</p>

<p>3 Dispatched on 21 May, it conveyed details about an Australian goodwill mission to South East Asia headed by W. Macmahon Ball (see Document 140).</p>
