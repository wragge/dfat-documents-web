<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 192. [1]</p>

<p>Matter was considered in Cabinet this morning. If convoy U.S.2 were allowed to proceed normally beyond Colombo, it would be still possible to divert it before entering the Red Sea should the situation require it. In the circumstances we suggest that this course be followed and if, as we hope, the Commonwealth Government agree, we should be glad if they would arrange for further signal to be sent to the Commander of the Escort accordingly. As indicated in my telegram 131 [2] we hope to telegraph tomorrow general appreciation for which you have asked.</p>
