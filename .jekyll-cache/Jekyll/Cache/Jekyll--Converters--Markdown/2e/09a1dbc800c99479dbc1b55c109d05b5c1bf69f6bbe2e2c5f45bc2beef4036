<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Prior to receipt of your 302 [1] of 27th May in discussions with Lacy of Indonesian Department we reiterated views expressed in telegram 293. [2] Lacy said Cochran unusually optimistic and anticipated reoccupation of Djokjakarta should be settled by mid- June. He thought that Hague Conference could therefore be held by mid-July.</p>

<p>Lacy anticipated difficulty would be met in enforcement of cease- fire order. Bringing in of Representative from Guerrillas was important step though still not a guarantee that the cease-fire order would be carried out. He thought some of the Dutch were thinking in terms of using failure to carry out the cease-fire order as an excuse for further delay. Lacy, however, considered this attitude untenable and one which would not finally be adopted.</p>

<p>Lacy considered that Lovink had seen the wisdom in lending support to the present non-Communist Indonesian Leaders. He also expressed the view that Lovinkâ€™s assistant, Dr. De Kat Angelino whom Lacy knows well, is a Liberal with an open mind on the question.</p>

<p>He considered United States unlikely to take any initiative, at least for some weeks.</p>
