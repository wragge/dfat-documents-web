I"I<p>Cablegram 169 [1] CANBERRA, 31 August 1944</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE PERSONAL TO BRUCE FROM EVATT SECRET</p>

<p>Please see our 207 to Dominions Office on Civil Aviation. [2] My personal view is that this conference should take advantage of the occasion to discuss our general policy in international civil aviation as laid down in the Australia - New Zealand Agreement.</p>

<p>[3] The recent United States attitude to the British Air Service to South America [4] illustrates the necessity of either (1) Maximum international control of trunk routes, or alternatively (2) British Commonwealth Government routes.</p>

<p>The objective should be to bring the United States into an international conference as early as possible so that a halt can be called to the United States inclination to favour arrangements which differ in no great respect from pre-war procedure which was the antithesis of international collaboration in the interests of all.</p>
