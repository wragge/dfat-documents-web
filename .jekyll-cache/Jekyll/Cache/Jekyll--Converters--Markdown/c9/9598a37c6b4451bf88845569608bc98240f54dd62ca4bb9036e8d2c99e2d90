I" <p>Cablegram S[W] [1] 20 CANBERRA, 7 May 1943</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>I am firmly convinced that it is vital to the success of the war that British-Russian relations be maintained at the highest level.</p>

<p>The Polish difficulty must not be allowed to intrude elements of controversy leading to strains. Therefore I would be prepared to advise Bruce that we will be cabling [2] that Australia act provided that it is understood that Officer is the only person circumstances permit to represent us in Russia. If his standing is acceptable to the Polish Government and we would be so advised I would agree to carry out Bruceâ€™s suggestion. Desire your views this aspect immediately. [3]</p>
