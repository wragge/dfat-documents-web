I"î<p>Australian High Commission, London, 12 July 1966</p>

<p>6856. Secret</p>

<p>Following my return from Chequers, I called on Wilson again at midday today accompanied by High Commissioner, Bunting and McIntyre. <a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>He had with him Bottomley, George Thomson, Lord Shackleton<a href="#f2">2</a> and Charles Johnston, Burke Trend<a href="#f3">3</a> and other officials.</p>

<p>[ <em>matter omitted</em> ]</p>

<p>11. I asked Wilson to say something about Britainâ€™s attitude to entry into the Common Market.</p>

<p>He reiterated that Britain would go inâ€”â€˜indeed we are keen to go inâ€™â€”if it could get the right terms.</p>

<p>This would involve changes in EEC agricultural policies, on which Pompidou<a href="#f4">4</a> and Couve de Murville had last week not shown themselves accommodating.</p>

<p>Other obstacles to Britainâ€™s entry were disappearing rapidly: De Gaulle himself seemed to have killed the concept of federalism.</p>

<p>But it was still impossible to say how far De Gaulle would insist on British dissociation from the United States.</p>

<p>George Thomson thought that British entry was still a long way ahead: the French were being very ambiguous about their intentions.</p>

<p>He noted, in response to my question, that the Americans seemed to have replaced their original unreserved and over-simplified support for European unification by a more critical regard for what it would mean to American interests, e.g. agricultural.</p>
