<p>Reference H 25 [1] and Canberra correspondence with Batavia August 18th [2] and September 9th [3], Portuguese Minister for Colonies [4] has repeated to British representative at Lisbon [5] that he regards Staughton concession as dead but he is quite willing to grant to a British or Australian company either the same or a new concession at the same time Portuguese Government in considering request for a larger area find it difficult to ignore claims of Wittouck. [6] British representativeâ€™s opinion is that best course for Pascoe would be to cut adrift altogether from Staughton concession and break fresh ground personally with new Governor.</p>
