<p>SECRET</p>

<p>On Friday morning Cochran took the Netherlands reply to his informal proposals to Djokjakarta. [1] The Netherlands have not rejected the Cochran plan as such but have proposed a number of amendments. As far as I can learn the main objections are to the elections and the powers of the interim government.</p>

<p>2. It seems likely the Netherlands would accept the conditions for the resumption of negotiations stipulated by the Republic but have suggested their own conditions:</p>

<p>(a) The freezing of Republican foreign relations, (b) A change in the policy of the Republic, away from subversive activities and anti-Dutch propaganda, (c) Public condemnation of communism by the Republican Government.</p>

<p>3. Cochran has suggested to the Republic that it might in turn submit its own amendments to his proposals, but the initial reaction of all Republican authorities is that this would only lead to further delay and eventual deadlock. [2]</p>

<p>4. Full consideration of the problem by the Security Council appears necessary and indeed inevitable. We are preparing a Fourth Interim Report of the Committee with this in mind.</p>
