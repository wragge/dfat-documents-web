<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>FINLAND. Am most disturbed at lack of clear thinking and failure to face the issues involved. Have exhausted my efforts with individual members of the War Cabinet and have now asked for High Commissioners‚Äô meeting with sub-committee including the Prime Minister [1] and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [2] which will probably take Place tomorrow unless something definite results from tomorrow‚Äôs War Cabinet.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Neville Chamberlain.</p>

<p>2 Lord Halifax.</p>
