<p>O.JA7855 CONFIDENTIAL IMMEDIATE</p>

<h2 id="east-timor">East Timor</h2>

<p>Tjan (CSIS) and the State Secretariat have just told us that President Soeharto signed the bill integrating East Timor with Indonesia during a ceremony held this morning 17th July. In the Indonesian view the formal and legal integration of East Timor is thus complete.</p>

<ol>
  <li>During the ceremony President Suharto presented to the East Timor delegation a duplicate of the Indonesian flag first raised by Soekamo and Hatta on 17 August 1945. This flag will be raised in Dili on 17 August in commemoration of Indonesian independence.</li>
  <li>In Indonesian and PGET eyes East Timor is now a province of Indonesia under acting Governor Araujo until he is formally installed which is expected shortly.</li>
  <li>Continuing support for FRETILIN will in future be regarded as an attempt to undermine Indonesian unity (Roque Rodrigues[‚Äô] activities in Australia which are being given wide coverage on Radio Australia will be seen in this light).</li>
  <li>Indonesia will want humanitarian aid for East Timor to be channelled through the Indonesian Red Cross in future rather than through the ICRC.</li>
  <li>There are of course other implications for Australia/Indonesian relations and we shall report further on this on Monday.</li>
