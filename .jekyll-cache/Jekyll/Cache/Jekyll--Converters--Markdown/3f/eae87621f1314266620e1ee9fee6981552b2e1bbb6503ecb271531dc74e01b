He regards this as a big step in the right direction and hopes that the next stage, the transfer of sovereignty, can be achieved by an ‘equally heartening display of goodwill and mutual trust on both sides’. His feeling is that ‘We must do everything possible to rally the Nationalist and Democratic forces in that area to resist the encroachments of Communism and that a settlement in Indonesia will be an important single contribution to this end’.</p>
