<p>TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>I understand that you are to be approached through the United Kingdom High Commissionerâ€™s office with a suggestion that we should provide in Australia facilities for trials of guided missiles. We discussed this with W. H.COULSON,in November last when he was in Australia. [1] I am informed that this is almost certain to be one of the biggest defence research fields of the future. Our co-operation in this matter would be an important contribution to British Commonwealth defence and I think that it will be very much in our interests to take part in this work. I would like to recommend acceptance of proposal to send Mission to Australia to discuss the matter.</p>
