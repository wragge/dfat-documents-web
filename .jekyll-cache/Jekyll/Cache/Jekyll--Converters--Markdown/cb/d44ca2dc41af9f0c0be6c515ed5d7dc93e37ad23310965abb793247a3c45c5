<p>MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>My immediately following telegram contains text of draft resolution to be submitted to the Conference tomorrow. There will be minor Amendments only.</p>

<p>2. The procedure is likely to be a public session tomorrow afternoon, Saturday, at which resolutions are formally moved and adopted by Conference; chairman will then be asked to communicate resolution to Secretary-General and probably Australia and India and perhaps one other will be asked to present case to Council.</p>

<p>3. It may be, however, that some representati[ves] may say they cannot agree to resolution without the approval from Government and agreement may therefore [be] ad referendum. [You] will appreciate that while you are being sent draft of text others will not see these until tomorrow and will have no opportunity to obtain instructions.</p>

<p>4. Glad of immediate instructions as to whether.</p>

<p>(a). We can agree now.</p>

<p>(b). Agreement should be ad referendum.</p>

<p>(c). There can be no publicity of these texts as they draft only and moreover conference may decide to submit to Secretary-General prior to publication.</p>
