<p>Your 268. [1] Indonesia.</p>

<p>We are sending you by bag copy of full text of United States - Australian Working Paper [2] which was submitted to Netherlands and Republican delegates 10th June.</p>

<p>Indian Governmentâ€™s understanding of the main points of the plan is correct. We consider that, while some of its features may be unacceptable to the Dutch in their present form, plan as a whole provides a sound basis for settlement of outstanding issues and for orderly transition from Netherlands to Indonesian sovereignty.</p>

<p>We have been strongly in favour all along of Committee of Good Offices taking initiative since it has become increasingly clear that parties are unable to reach agreement as between themselves.</p>

<p>At recent meetings of Security Council our representative has been pressing to have United States - Australian plan considered by the Council on its merits.</p>
