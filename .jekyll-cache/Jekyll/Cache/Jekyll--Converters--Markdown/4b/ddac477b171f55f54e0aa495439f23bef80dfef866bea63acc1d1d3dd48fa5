<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>I sought and obtained a discussion with Churchill at White House today on the subject matter of your telegrams 1103 [1], 1106 [2], and 1108. [3] I emphasised the facts and point of view expressed in the above telegrams. British Chiefs of Staff Pound, Dill and Portal were called in. The President [4] joined the discussion and subsequently called in Colonel Knox (Secretary of Navy). I will send you further telegram later as to possibilities that emerged in the course of discussion. You may expect telegram from Churchill within 24 hours which I hope will implement the above- mentioned possibilities.</p>
