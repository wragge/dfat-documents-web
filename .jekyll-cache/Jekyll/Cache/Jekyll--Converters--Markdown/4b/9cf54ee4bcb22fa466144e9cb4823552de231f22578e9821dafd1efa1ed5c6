<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL HIMSELF</p>

<p>My telegram 107 of 20th July. [1] The discussions on very high</p>

<p>level referred to were with Hopkins, Marshall and King who arrived</p>

<p>in this country on Friday of last week. Their presence here was</p>

<p>kept a very close secret and I was specially asked to make no</p>

<p>reference to it. The object of the visit was to review with the</p>

<p>Government and Chiefs of Staff [here our broad] [2] strategy of</p>

<p>the war.</p>

<p>As a result of a week of almost continuous discussions, agreement</p>

<p>has been reached between the Chiefs of Staff and Marshall and King</p>

<p>which will now be submitted to the President and War Cabinet here</p>

<p>for confirmation.</p>

<p>The decisions do not involve any departure from the major</p>

<p>strategic policy already agreed upon but make recommendations of</p>

<p>an operational character which it is not possible for me to</p>

<p>telegraph. My own impression of the decisions is that they are</p>

<p>sound. [3]</p>

<p>The contacts which have been established by the Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>with Marshall and King during the past week will be of the utmost</p>

<p>value and constitute in my view the greatest step forward that has</p>

<p>yet been taken towards the establishment of Anglo-American</p>

<p>strategy and operational co-operation.</p>

<p>In particular I am glad to say that the discussions showed a</p>

<p>greater appreciation of the importance of the Pacific which is</p>

<p>exemplified by the allocation to that theatre of substantial</p>

<p>American Air Forces previously car-marked for the European</p>

<p>theatre.</p>

<p>The above is of course most secret and confidential.</p>

<p>3 The principal decision was to give priority to an Allied landing</p>

<p>in French North Africa rather than in northern France.</p>
