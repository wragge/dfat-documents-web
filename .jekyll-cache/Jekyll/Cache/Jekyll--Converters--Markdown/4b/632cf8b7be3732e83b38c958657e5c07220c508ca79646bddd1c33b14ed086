<p>Dear Mr. Bruce,</p>

<p>Sir Sydney Henn [1] M.P., one of the representatives of the Crown Colonies upon the Imperial Economic Committee, told me that in the course of a discussion with Amery [2] on the future of the I.E.C., he had told to Amery that Mackinder [3] was an unsatisfactory Chairman. As Amery and Mackinder have been friends for many years it may be of considerable importance that a man such as Sir Sydney who is known to be reserved should have expressed this view to Amery.</p>

<p>The British Government is appointing Mr. F. M. Blundell [4] M.P.</p>

<p>to the I. E. C. to represent British Agriculture. He is a friend of mine and will I feel sure prove both a strong agricultural representative and still a good Empire man.</p>

<p>Mr. W. S. Crawford [5] the Advertising expert is resigning and I believe the Government is proposing to ask Mr. J. W. Hills [6] M.P., an ex-minister, to serve.</p>

<p>The Government also have in mind seeking the services of Lord Lovat in place of Sir Algernon Firth [7], in the Autumn. Whether this latter point is accurate or not I do not quite know.</p>

<p>Anyhow the other changes will substantially improve the poor British representation on the Committee.</p>

<p>I think these points will be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL</p>

<p>_1 Conservative M.P.; representative for the Colonies and Protectorates on the Imperial Economic Committee.</p>

<p>2 Leopold Amery, Secretary for the Colonies and for Dominion Affairs.</p>

<p>3 Sir Halford Mackinder, Chairman of the Imperial Economic Committee.</p>

<p>4 Conservative M.P.; President of the Central and Associated Chambers of Agriculture.</p>

<p>5 United Kingdom representative on the Imperial Economic Committee.</p>

<p>6 Conservative M.P.; Financial Secretary to the Treasury 1922-23.</p>

<p>7 United Kingdom representative on the Imperial Economic Committee.</p>
