<p>Submission Nos. 554 and 608â€”China Policy<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>The Cabinet noted Submission No. 608.</p>

<p>2. It decided that Australia continue its present dialogue in order to normalise our bilateral relations with the P.R.C., moving at all times with caution and with a careful assessment of Australiaâ€™s interests, and taking explicit account of our relationship with the R.O.C.</p>

<p>3. It was understood that in his statement shortly to be made to the Parliament on foreign policy, the Minister would, without at this point being tied to a precise form of words, take account of the following principal elements in the section on China:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Nixonâ€™s visit to Peking and United States policy towards the P.R.C.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Australiaâ€™s wish to achieve an understanding with the P.R. C. It was noted that the recent exchange in Paris showed P.R.C. was not prepared to accord to Australia treatment similar to that accorded United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Australia hoped that the question of the future relationship between the peoples on either side of the Straits of Taiwan could be resolved peacefully and by negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Australia should, in the evolution of its China Policy, have full regard to the positions of neighbouring Asian countries and the importance of our relationships with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. The Cabinet noted that the Minister would consult the Prime Minister on the terms of his proposed statement.</p>

<p>5. The Minister undertook to consider, in consultation with the Prime Minister, the suggestion that an expression of interest on Australiaâ€™s part to send a Parliamentary Delegation to the U.S.S.R. during the forthcoming Parliamentary recess might have some bargaining advantage in the dialogue with the P.R.C.</p>
