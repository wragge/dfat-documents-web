<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Security 512.</p>

<p>We have repeatedly opposed delaying tactics in Council and urged expeditious handling of Indonesian question.</p>

<p>At last meeting we spoke strongly against United Kingdom proposal for meeting next week, but as indicated in last paragraph our Security 510 [1] proposal for earlier meeting received only five votes namely Australia, Colombia, Poland, Soviet Union and Syria.</p>

<p>We agree with your remarks on Consular Report [2], but Dutch are receiving strong support in Council from Belgium and France while United States, United Kingdom and Brazil are opposed to any withdrawal of forces.</p>
