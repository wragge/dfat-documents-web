I"›<p>Manila, 13 March 1963</p>

<p>188. Secret Immediate</p>

<p>Please deliver the following message from Sir Garfield Barwick immediately to Tunku Abdul Rahman.</p>

<p>1. â€˜I have been having talks in Manila with Pelaez, Macapagal and Subandrio. These (particularly those with Subandrio) have led me to believe that there is a real possibility of modifying Indonesian and Philippine hostility to Malaysia without delaying target date of 31st August.</p>

<p>2. I am particularly concerned at the deterioration in Malayanâ€“Indonesian relations and am convinced that steps should be taken now to heal the position. We have supported Malaysia but feel need to present it in such a manner that Indonesian hostility is neither increased nor given any appearance of justification. My discussions in Manila have led me to think tension could be considerably eased if public statements were toned down to present Malaysia as a practical contribution to regional stability and as a natural development of the emergence into independence of territories all formerly under British administration and desirous of obtaining strength and coherence by association with each other in a federation. I have come to think that the Indonesians should be reassured of Malayan adherence to the principles of non-intervention by overt or covert means in affairs of a neighbouring state. (In this connexion, could not Des Alwi be taken off the air and consideration given to creating confidence by some positive undertakings that Sumitro encouraged.) I can not but feel that strong assertions that intention to create Malaysia in the face of outright Indonesian opposition, however much we might [think]<a href="#f1">1</a> that in the end this might have to be done, are counter-productive and more likely to create a lasting mischievous hostility.</p>

<p>3. I would like to see an end to public recriminations and I think it would be helpful if you were to make a public expression of willingness to meet the Indonesians and the Philippines at up to ministerial level in an endeavour to remove misconceptions and to promote understanding and to seek a basis of future intra-Malay co-operation. I would not, however, recommend a â€˜summitâ€™ meeting, which would pose special difficulties. It seems to me that yesterdayâ€™s statement by the Philippines Foreign Office regarding the objectives of proposed talks might offer a suitable basis for consultations.<a href="#f2">2</a> Among other things this would enable you, without conceding to a delay in Malaysia, to make a comprehensive exposition of the proposals and reasons for them.</p>

<p>4. I am making a public statement myself commending the conference.<a href="#f3">3</a> I have sent you already the text.â€™</p>

<p>2 The statement, released 11 March, said that Pelaez had called for â€˜discussion in three main directions. 1. Problems arising from the proposal to establish the Federation of Malaysia; 2. The promotion of fraternal and neighbourly relations among the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaya; and 3. The maintenance of enduring peace and stability of South East Asiaâ€™.</p>
