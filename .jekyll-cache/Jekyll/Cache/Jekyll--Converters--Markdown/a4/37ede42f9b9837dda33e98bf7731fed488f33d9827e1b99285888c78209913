I"Ê<p>Letter BANGKA, 23 May 1949</p>

<p>The preliminary agreement [1] reached at Jacarta between the Delegations of the Republic of Indonesia and of the Netherlands, though not entirely satisfactory nor of decisive character, can give us hope that the Indonesian-Dutch dispute may soon be brought to a definite equitable settlement under the auspices of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia under the constant supervision of the United Nations Organization.</p>

<p>This result has been made possible only through the splendid advocacy and support that Your Government has given to our cause since its introduction to the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p>The further developments in the implementation of the Security Councilâ€™s resolution [2] of January 28, 1949 and directive [3] of March 23, for which the discussions between the Indonesian and Netherlands Delegations have been resumed, will however still need and, I am sure, also have the unremitting attention of Your Government.</p>

<p>Therefore I deem it my duty, personally and on behalf of my country and people to offer our heartfelt thanks for the unflagging interest and sympathy, that Your Government is giving us in this affair.</p>

<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to offer to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
