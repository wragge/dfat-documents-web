I"©<p>Memorandum NEW DELHI, 3 February 1949</p>

<p>ASIAN CONFERENCE</p>

<p>Further to our despatch No. 6/49 [1] of February 3rd and to the cablegrams therein referred to, we desire to report a conversation between the Egyptian Ambassador (Ismail Kamel Bey), the High Commissioner and myself when the Ambassador called on Mr. Gollan today.</p>

<p>2. The Ambassador paid warm tribute to Dr. Burtonâ€™s work at the Delhi conference and to what he described as his farsightedness and balance.</p>

<p>3. The Ambassador was pleased with the results of the conference.</p>

<p>Referring to Bajpaiâ€™s aide memoire [2], he said that he (Ismail Kamel Bey) envisaged two blocs (sic) both centred on India and both pledged to democratic principles in a way which would stem the advance of Communism. He was most eloquent on this subject. He then went on to say that like India, Indonesia should be a member of both groups since she was spiritually part of Islam. The Ambassadorâ€™s other arguments in support of a dual role for Indonesia were a little difficult to grasp.</p>
