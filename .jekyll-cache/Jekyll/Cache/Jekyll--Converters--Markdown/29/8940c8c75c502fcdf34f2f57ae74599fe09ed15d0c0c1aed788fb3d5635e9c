<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 382 of 19th June [1]:</p>

<p>We have fully in mind the views of the Commonwealth Government regarding the minimum force which the United States should be asked to maintain in the Pacific and the reply which has been addressed to the naval authorities as summarized in my telegram of 18th June 422 [2] was designed to give effect to the object which we understand the Commonwealth Government have in mind. The United States movement which has now been completed will leave in the Pacific forces considerably in excess of those which we had previously considered to be adequate and we have discouraged the United States authorities from further transfers [to] [3] the Atlantic until more United States capital ships become available and our own capital ship strength is restored.</p>

<p>As regards the third paragraph of your telegram, the present position as regards the suggested declaration in respect of the Netherlands East Indies is set out in my Circular M. 115 of 20th June. [4] We are, however, keeping under constant review the possibility of persuading the United States Government to join with us in a declaration on the lines contemplated, and will maintain close touch with you on the subject.</p>

<p>You will have seen from my Circular M. 120 of 23rd June [5] that the United States Government have authorized their Ambassador at Tokyo [6] to give private warning to Japan if occasion offers.</p>
