I"]<p>Cablegram 29 LONDON, 1 July 1940, 8.39 p.m.</p>

<p>Foreign Office Telegram No. 1325 to Lord Lothian [1] is in my view</p>

<p>of transcending importance and presents an opportunity to put a</p>

<p>case to the President [2] and Sumner Welles [3] based on United</p>

<p>States self-interest to induce them to do what it is vital in our</p>

<p>interest should be done.</p>

<p>Apart from a declaration of war by the United States making the</p>

<p>U.K. and the U.S. fleets a common unit there is no immediate help</p>

<p>of outstanding value that the U.S. can render.</p>

<p>The vital necessity is that the U.S. should immediately organise</p>

<p>her unparalleled economic potentialities, but if this is to be</p>

<p>effective sufficiently to accelerate the pace of the existing</p>

<p>machine profound and fundamental reorganisation on a national</p>

<p>basis will have to be effected (see Telegram to Lothian No. 1325,</p>

<p>1 b).</p>

<p>This would be essential in the interests of the U.S. if the U.K.</p>

<p>were to go the way of France, but will be equally essential if the</p>

<p>U.K. can resist invasion and carry on with British fleet based on</p>

<p>the U.K., as, in my view, through loss of time and destruction of</p>

<p>factories due to enemy air action, British production, however</p>

<p>well organized, cannot reach the volume necessary to obtain air</p>

<p>supremacy and equip the divisions required to meet the position in</p>

<p>Africa and the Middle East as it develops, [and carry] [4] out</p>

<p>sporadic but perpetual harassing of the enemy along the 2000 miles</p>

<p>of European coast line it now occupies, which will be essential.</p>

<p>It will therefore be necessary to look to the U.S. and Canada</p>

<p>primarily and to Australia to a minor extent to meet this need.</p>

<p>Our approach to the U.S. in my view should be to make clear beyond</p>

<p>any possibility of doubt that there is no contribution in man-</p>

<p>power for land forces which the U.S. would be asked to or in fact</p>

<p>could usefully make-that it is enough if through her industrial</p>

<p>capacity her help can be rendered-that out of our experience we</p>

<p>can tell her that nothing short of an all-in national effort will</p>

<p>be sufficient to make that industrial capacity produce the results</p>

<p>required of it-urge that any action in any case taken at once is</p>

<p>to be presumed in U.S.’s own interests quite apart from its value</p>

<p>to us in carrying on the struggle.</p>

<p>Repeated to Canberra, No. 500.</p>

<p>1 U.K. Ambassador to the United States. The cablegram, dispatched</p>

<p>On 30 June, instructed Lothian to convey to the U.S. Govt that the</p>

<p>U.K. Govt, having made a thorough review of the economic situation</p>

<p>created by the fall of France, desired ‘to impress upon the United</p>

<p>States administration their conviction that, in order to achieve</p>

<p>victory at the earliest possible moment, [they] must look to the</p>

<p>United States to furnish equipment, supplies of aircraft and other</p>

<p>munitions and essential raw materials on an altogether larger</p>

<p>scale than hitherto’. See file AA: A3300, 47.</p>
