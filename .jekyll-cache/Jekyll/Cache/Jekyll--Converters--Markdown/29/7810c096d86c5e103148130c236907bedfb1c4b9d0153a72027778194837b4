<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your D171 and D299.</p>

<p>We feel that a positive approach should be adopted to the problem of disarmament and that your D299 is negative in its approach. In our view the restoration of international confidence should not be made a condition precedent of any disarmament proposal. If all members of the United Nations accept the obligations of the Charter this should be sufficient for the successful implementation of a disarmament scheme. Only when some particular practical steps have been taken will a sense of confidence return to international relations.</p>

<p>2. We believe that the Disarmament Commission and the Military Staff Committee should give immediate attention to the implementation of Articles 43 and 53 of the Charter and at the same time give due consideration to Article 51.</p>

<p>3. The Commission should also give consideration to the general principles governing arms reduction and to the problems involved in an effective control system. We believe that the Commission should give thought to obtaining information on armed forces and armaments and that the supplying of this information should not be left merely to the [discretion] of member nations.</p>

<p>4. The Assembly resolution places on the Council the responsibility of giving prompt consideration to the formulation of practical measures for arms reduction. The Council and, under it the Commission, should be proceeding in a positive manner to carry out the Assembly mandate and the Council’s own resolution.</p>
