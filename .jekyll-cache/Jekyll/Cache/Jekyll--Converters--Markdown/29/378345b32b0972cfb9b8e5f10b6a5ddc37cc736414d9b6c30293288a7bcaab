<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED PERSONAL</p>

<p>Korean Commission was due to meet today, 31st January. Please make immediate arrangements to attend for one or two weeks according to how it develops and in order to report fully on the position as you see it. You should take Jamieson with you, who would remain after you return. With China in a weakened position, there are greater responsibilities on Australia working with the United States to make the Commission effective. In the first few days, there will be questions of procedure and election of officers, and you should accept the chairmanship if that is possible. Eckersley[1] can carry on in your absence but without any announcements or formal notification of your absence which is only temporary and in order that you might make a full report. Please advise date of movement which should be immediate.</p>

<p>_[1] J.W. Eckersley, First Secretary at Tokyo.</p>
