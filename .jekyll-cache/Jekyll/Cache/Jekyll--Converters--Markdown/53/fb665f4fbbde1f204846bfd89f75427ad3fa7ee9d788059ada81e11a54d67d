I"œ<p>Memorandum, Washington, 9 June 1950</p>

<p>NO. 1424/50. CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Pacific Defence Pact In a recent informal conversation between Mr. Plimsoll[1] and Mr. Wainhouse,[2] Deputy Director, United Nations Division of the State Department, Mr. Wainhouse made the following comment in a personal capacity. He said that Australia should not be discouraged by the failure of the State Department to respond more cordially to the Ministerâ€™s request for a Pacific Defence Pact. He urged that the Australian Government should keep this issue alive, possibly by following up Mr. Achesonâ€™s comments[3] on Mr. Spenderâ€™s speech and possibly by another public statement. He assured Mr. Plimsoll that there was strong support in the Department for a Pacific Pact, but that the Department should be given further material to work on.</p>

<p>2. With regard to the above, we shall ensure that the Ministerâ€™s remarks[4] of 8th June on the Pacific Defence Pact are conveyed to the State Department.</p>

<p>3 Acheson had addressed the Commonwealth Club of California at San Francisco on 15 March. In this address he had welcomed Spenderâ€™s statement on foreign policy to the House of Representatives on 9 March (see editorial note - Spenderâ€™s Statement in the House of Representatives - 9 March 1950) and had commended the free nations of Asia for proceeding with programmes for political stability and economic development.</p>
