<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram No. 94 to Canberra, 21 to London. [2]</p>

<p>Having seen press reports of German advice to Tokyo that Germany was not interested in Netherlands East Indies problem and heard that my Netherlands colleague [3] regarded this as giving Japan the all-clear signal, I enquired this morning views of State Department. Mr. Hornbeck [4] informed me that the more jingoistic Japanese press is interpreting this as a signal for Japanese action, but State Department believes that Japan will not make a move until they are assured of German success in Europe made [sic] it quite safe. Mr. Sumner Welles [5] assured Lord Lothian [6] last evening that United States had no intention of moving fleet from Hawaii to Atlantic although two heavy cruisers might be detached to patrol United States coast and South America.
