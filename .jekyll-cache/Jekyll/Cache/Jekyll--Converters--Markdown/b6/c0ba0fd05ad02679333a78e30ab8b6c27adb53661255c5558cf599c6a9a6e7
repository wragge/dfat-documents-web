<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME When this matter comes up for discussion you should welcome the initiative of the United States and express general agreement with the idea behind the programme.</p>

<p>2. We are willing to consider a contribution to a satisfactory scheme in the coming year provided no hard currency payments are involved.</p>

<p>3. The Government must be free to review the position from year to year in the light of changing financial and other circumstances, including overseas balances.</p>

<p>4. It is most unlikely that cabinet will consider the agendum prepared on the economic development programme in the near future.[1]</p>

<p>_[1] On 21 July 1949 External Affairs re-emphasised to the delegation that it should not refer, in statements, to the desirability of compulsory contributions since the government reserved the right to review its position from year to year.</p>
