I"æ<p>Cablegram unnumbered 4 September 1939,</p>

<p>Your broadcast message [l] moved Australia deeply. We ourselves have proclaimed a state of war and I have broadcast on behalf of the Commonwealth Government that we stand with Great Britain.</p>

<p>We firmly believe we have right on our side and in that strength victory is sure.</p>
