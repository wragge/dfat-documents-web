I"<p>Cablegram 40 27 September 1938,</p>

<p>Your 58. [1] Personal for Officer. Since Parliament met last week Commonwealth Government after closest consultation with United Kingdom Government and Bruce [2] have not made any statement whatever so as to preclude discussion which might aggravate present delicate situation. All parties have loyally conformed with this view.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government has notified United Kingdom Government of its whole hearted support in present efforts for peace and concurrence in policy laid down speech Prime Minister March 24 [3] and reaffirmed speech Simon [4] on 27th August but has not gone beyond public statement to this effect.</p>

<p>Statement mainly narrative and factual will probably be made tomorrow after further consultation Bruce to-night following on return Wilson [5] from Germany. You will appreciate to-morrow will be probably decisive. I should venture that opinion here still divided though definitely hardening in favour stand against aggression.</p>
