He will himself be under the command of General MacArthur and will be served by an integrated Commonwealth staff.</p>

<p>3. To effect Governmental control there will be set up in Australia a Commonwealth organisation to be known as the ‘Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia’ and the decisions of this body will pass to the Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Forces.</p>

<p>4. Units of the British Pacific Fleet will also be stationed in Japanese waters and will remain under the control of the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff continuing to work in close co-operation with the United States Pacific Fleet.</p>
