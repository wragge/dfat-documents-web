<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>London Meeting The scope of the forthcoming discussions is, we think, generally agreed. The main discussions would seem to fall naturally under the headings:-</p>

<p>(1) Dumbarton Oaks proposals, with special reference to comments by British Commonwealth Governments.</p>

<p>(2) Territorial Trustee-ship (my telegram 12th February D. No.</p>

<p>429). [1]</p>

<p>Other possible questions are:-</p>

<p>(3) The future of the Permanent Court of International justice (my telegram 12th March D. No. 427 [2]).</p>

<p>(4) The future of the League of Nations (a paper on this subject is being prepared).</p>

<p>2. If other British Commonwealth Governments have any suggestions to make under these or other headings we should be glad to have them as soon as possible.</p>
