<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Your telegram of 28th October, No. 85. [1] We are very grateful for the full expression of views of the Commonwealth Government as to the measures to be taken at the Brussels Conference. We should like to make it clear that, as indicated in the last paragraph of my circular telegram B.114 of 19th October [2], His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom had no intention of stating a policy. Their object was to call attention to all the possible aspects of the problem arising out of the Sino-Japanese war, and above all to set out the fundamental difficulties inherent in any solution other than that of peace by agreement. Further, it is certainly not the intention of His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom that the Brussels Conference should take the matter out of the hands of the League whose Advisory Committee is in fact to meet as soon as possible after the Conference to consider the result of the efforts made here to bring about a peaceful settlement.</p>
