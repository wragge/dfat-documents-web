<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Reference Critchleyâ€™s telegram K.32. [1]</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to press Dutch to accept statement of principles contained in Annex 2 of Committeeâ€™s plan. [2] We had anticipated that they would be prepared to accept Annex 1 [3] in general, but we fear they may invoke further delays over consideration of Annex 2. You will be best able to judge whether anything can be achieved on lines of paragraph 10(a) of K.32 without further prejudice to Republican position; it would appear that in any event early publication by Committee of its full plan, together with annexes, as a document representing Committeeâ€™s unanimous agreement, would have salutary effect.</p>
