<p>Top Secret</p>

<p><strong>Future size and role of the Pacific Islands Regiment</strong></p>

<p>The Defence Committee noted that following his discussion with the Committee on the 30th May 1968 (Minute No 42/1968)<a href="#f1">1</a> the Secretary, Department of External Territories requested that his Departmentâ€¢s views be recorded as per the attached.</p>

<p>2. The Chairman intimated that an exchange of correspondence was in process between the Minister for External Territories and the Minister for Defence<a href="#f2">2</a> and that if the questions of the timing of the proposed review, and the build-up and role of the Army in Papua and New Guinea were not resolved between them, it was to be expected that the questions would go to Cabinet for consideration.</p>

<p>FUTURE OF PIR: EXTERNAL TERRITORIES VIEW</p>

<p>The weight of opinion in the Defence Committee appears to point towards a PIR strength of 2,800 or so local troops plus up to 650 ARA by June 1969.</p>

<p>This would represent an expansion of nearly fifteen per cent over the current strength of 2,455. This figure results from continued recruitment during the fifteen months since the question of the size of the force was first raised by the Minister for External Territories. The strength has increased by over 260 even since last October when Ministers agreed that the question of the future size of the PIR should be submitted to Cabinet.</p>

<p>At the same time the Defence Committee contemplates a review, by not later than 1970, of the organisation and structure of the PIR and the requirements (including the possibility of a unified defence force) of Papua and New Guinea defence.</p>

<p>Having regard to the objective of a disciplined, stable, loyal and cohesive force and the disturbances that have occurred in the past within the PIR over wages and conditions of service, the rate of expansion now proposed still appears to be faster than is desirable or necessary. The fact that it would accord with a previously decided programme does not seem to outweigh these considerations.</p>

<p>The Department of External Territories considers a reasonable course would be to hold the strength at approximately the present level for the time being, and to carry out the proposed review immediately, the target strength of the force to be determined when the results of that review are available to be taken into account, and in the light of any new facts or strategic considerations.</p>
