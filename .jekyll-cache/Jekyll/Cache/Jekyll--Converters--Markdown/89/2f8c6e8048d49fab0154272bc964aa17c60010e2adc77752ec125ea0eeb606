I"œ<p>Cablegram 81 [1] 18 August 1939,</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My Government has noted with deep interest the report of peace moves for the settlement of various European questions and knows that the British Government will use every endeavour to take advantage of such moves. In particular we consider that efforts should be made to ensure that Poland adopts a reasonable and restrained attitude and that no nation should ignore real efforts at settlement because of false notions of prestige. You can rely upon the support and co-operation of myself and my Government in connection with any efforts made to effect a settlement of outstanding differences.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I strongly hold the view that pressure upon Poland should not be carried to a point which might awaken in Hitlerâ€™s [2] mind any thoughts that the Anglo-French guarantee to Poland in the event of aggression was in the least doubtful of fulfilment.</p>

<p>That would in my view certainly lead to German aggression and war.</p>

<p>Your anti-aggression pact and policy has so far succeeded. I do not need to tell you how warmly you and your work are regarded by us.</p>
