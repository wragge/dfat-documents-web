I"*<p>Cablegram Johcu 85 CANBERRA, 21 September 1944</p>

<p>TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Thank you for your Winch Nos. 7 [1], 8 [2], 9 [3] and 10. [4] I am most gratified to learn of the outstanding results achieved at the discussions at Octagon. [5] The British Naval contribution, which is to be made in the war against Japan, is indeed a splendid one.</p>

<p>This, together with the increased participation of British long- range air forces and the share of the land forces in the programme of military operations, is a convincing demonstration of the full and effective part which the British Nations are to play in the Pacific theatre. With the addition of this overwhelming strength to that of the Americans, I look forward to the speedy achievement against our Asiatic enemy of the same brilliant and decisive successes as are being gained against Germany.</p>

<p>2. It is a source of deep satisfaction to us that a British Naval component will be supplied to guard General MacArthur’s left flank and I am glad and grateful that it has been possible for you to arrange accordingly.</p>

<p>3. The arrangements you made to keep General Lavarack [6] informed of the decisions are much appreciated. I was not misled by the ill-informed press references and I made this clear in an announcement on 18th September. [7]</p>

<p>4. It will be a source of pleasure to you to learn that my War Cabinet and the Advisory War Council who have been given the substance of the broad picture are gratified at all that is involved.</p>

<p>Heartiest congratulations and warmest regards.</p>

<p>JOHN CURTIN</p>
