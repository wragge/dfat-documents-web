<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Our telegram No. 135. [1] Bajpai is becoming restless over Indonesia. He considers that time is now playing into the hands of the Dutch. He is a little apprehensive of what he describes as the Dutch attempt to make some transparently unreal concession in the form of a puppet Government. He does not wish to be quoted but he considers both the British and Americans are placing undue emphasis on the inability of the Indonesians to take over their own responsibilities.</p>
