I"<p>Cablegram 562 (extract) WASHINGTON, 26 July 1941, 2 a.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My No. 559. [1] I saw Secretary of Navy. [2] He told me</p>

<p>confidentially that naval arrangements under which the United</p>

<p>States Navy take over the protection of merchant shipping in</p>

<p>north-west Atlantic were well advanced and that this control would</p>

<p>begin to come into operation possibly within a week and that this</p>

<p>should provide appreciable relief to British Navy in Atlantic. He</p>

<p>said, of course, the movements of British warships from the</p>

<p>Atlantic to Singapore would be a matter for decision by the</p>

<p>British Government. He said that the United States Government had</p>

<p>no proposals in view for movements of any more American warships</p>

<p>from the Pacific into the Atlantic. I understand from British</p>

<p>sources that although the above-mentioned American control of</p>

<p>north-west Atlantic may begin within a week it is unlikely to be</p>

<p>fully established for two or even three weeks.</p>

<p>With reference to Prime Minister’s telegram No. 80 [3] I can well</p>

<p>understand your anxiety to get undertaking of armed support from</p>

<p>United States Government in view of possibility of conflict in the</p>

<p>Far East arising from the result of the joint economic action.</p>

<p>However, I believe that it will be impossible to get such</p>

<p>undertaking. I believe that events and not logic[al] [4] arguments</p>

<p>will drive the United States into belligerency. However, I believe</p>

<p>that the present moment is appropriate to seek to get a speeding</p>

<p>up of the naval plans arrived at in the staff conversations in</p>

<p>Washington in March 1941 [5] which entail a redistribution of</p>

<p>naval forces as between the Atlantic and Singapore. As you will</p>

<p>remember, the abovementioned plan entailed the movement of three</p>

<p>United States capital ships from the Pacific into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>This has already been done. The plan envisaged the movement of six</p>

<p>British capital ships from the Atlantic to Singapore on the United</p>

<p>States becoming belligerent and on the threat of war in the Far</p>

<p>East.</p>
