<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>I thank you for your telegram of 28th June with reference to the</p>

<p>Far Eastern situation. [1] We entirely agree with you on the</p>

<p>following points-</p>

<p>(a) The delicacy and danger of the situation.</p>

<p>(b) The desirability of obtaining a clear indication of the United</p>

<p>States policy in the Far East.</p>

<p>(c) The desirability, if circumstances allow, of retaining the</p>

<p>United States fleet in the Pacific.</p>

<p>(d) The extreme undesirability of any act or omission on our part</p>

<p>which might have the effect of unnecessarily precipitating trouble</p>

<p>with Japan in our present situation.</p>

<p>(e) The undesirability of any attempt to haggle with Japan.</p>

<p>(f) The undesirability in the best interests of the British</p>

<p>Commonwealth of involvement of United States in a war in the Far</p>

<p>East.</p>

<p>(g) The probable futility of the suggestion that in the present</p>

<p>circumstances Japan might be induced on the lines proposed to</p>

<p>offer the restoration of territorial integrity and independence of</p>

<p>China.</p>

<p>On the other hand we are most sceptical as to whether Japan would</p>

<p>in the existing situation be persuaded to make a satisfactory</p>

<p>tripartite declaration as to status quo in the Pacific or whether</p>

<p>such a declaration if made would have any value at all unless</p>

<p>accompanied by a full United States guarantee, which would seem</p>

<p>unlikely at the moment.</p>

<p>Again we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the offer of</p>

<p>mediation that you propose, in the absence of United States</p>

<p>collaboration, offers any substantial promise of successful</p>

<p>results. Nor are we convinced that a simple acceptance of the</p>

<p>present Japanese demands would be morally right or even</p>

<p>politically expedient. Indeed we are inclined to feel that an</p>

<p>acceptance of the Japanese demands or an offer of mediation</p>

<p>between Japan and China might well be interpreted by the Japanese</p>

<p>as a plain indication of the weakness of our position and of our</p>

<p>readiness on that account to sacrifice the Chinese and the</p>

<p>principle of resisting aggression for the purpose of endeavouring</p>

<p>to protect our own interests. We are at present inclined to feel</p>

<p>that an appearance of continued confidence is more likely to be</p>

<p>effective with the Japanese than any step which might be</p>

<p>interpreted as a display of weakness. On the whole, however, we</p>

<p>are inclined to defer formation of any definite judgment on this</p>

<p>most difficult problem until it has been possible to ascertain the</p>

<p>result of the approach which has already been made by His</p>

<p>Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom to the United States</p>

<p>Government.</p>

<p>A copy of this telegram has today been despatched to the Secretary</p>

<p>of State for Dominion Affairs. [2]</p>
