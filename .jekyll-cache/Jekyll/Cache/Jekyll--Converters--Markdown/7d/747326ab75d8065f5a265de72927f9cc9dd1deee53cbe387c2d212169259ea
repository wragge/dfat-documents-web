I"<p>Cablegram 111 CANBERRA, 26 January 1942</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>1. In my No. 15 [1] I asked you to convey Prime Minister’s [2] personal message and I regret that without any authority you circulated such a document to British Chiefs of Staff. Such a course is embarrassing in the extreme and may be prejudicial.</p>

<p>2. The JOHCU series is a personal series of messages and that is why it was intended for the eye of the President [3] alone.</p>

<p>3. If I correctly gather from your para. 2 [4] that specific operation referred to was not mentioned to President, whole purpose of our suggestion may be frustrated; it does not follow, because you are not supposed to know, that Prime Minister here is not informed, because of liaison over Anzac area.</p>
