<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>1. The Darwin area is of greatest importance to Australia and the only port of value in North West Australia. We consider that Darwin must be held. In view of present situation [1] it is essential to know your final plans with regard to your naval forces and where they are based. Also whether in event of aerodromes in Netherlands East Indies becoming untenable it is intended to transfer Air Forces to Darwin.</p>

<p>2. Reference your No. 02126 [2] please state whether disposal of Abdacom means that Darwin is reverting to Australian Command. [3]</p>
