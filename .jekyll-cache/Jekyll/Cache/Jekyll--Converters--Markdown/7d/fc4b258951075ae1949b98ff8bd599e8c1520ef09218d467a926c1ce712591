<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Had informal personal talks with Schuurman today. He agreed with the view that the three power committee would obtain the best results if definite terms of reference were given to obtain solution of the problem particularly from the Dutch point of view, but this is personal and unofficial.</p>
