<p>MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>Bruce has sent me his cable of 17th February [1] and yours of 23rd February [2] regarding wool. I have discussed with the British Ministry of Economic Warfare representative here. [3] The State Department, which is now the Department concerned, have no objection to wool being sold to Japan on three-monthly basis in place of one month so long as not sold on extension of credit. I have so cabled Bruce. [4]</p>
