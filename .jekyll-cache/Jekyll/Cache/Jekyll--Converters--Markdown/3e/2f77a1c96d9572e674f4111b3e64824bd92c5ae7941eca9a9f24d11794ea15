<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Briefly the argument behind this [1] is that under Chapter 6 the Dutch could go on with their aggressive activities (if that is what is happening) despite Security Council action. If, however, the matter is brought under Chapter 7 (by Article 39) the Council can order the immediate cessation of hostilities. I am uneasy about the proposal put forward by Throssell and Loomes for the reason that under the Pacific Settlement chapter [2] we are merely suggesting the investigation of a dispute that has international repercussions, while under Chapter 7 we are implying, even if we donâ€™t say it, that there has actually been a â€˜breach of the peaceâ€™. This might seem like prejudging the issue, although it is only a matter of degree, and the advantages of Chapter 7 might be outweighed by this.</p>
