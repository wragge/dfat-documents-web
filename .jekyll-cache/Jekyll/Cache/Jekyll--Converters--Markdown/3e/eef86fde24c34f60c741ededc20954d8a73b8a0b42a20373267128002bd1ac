<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL AND MOST CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>I discussed the situation today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Political Director, Dr. van Mook and Dr. van Roijen.</p>

<p>The two latter go to New York tonight and hope to see the Minister there.</p>

<p>2. There is general pessimism about the success of either the Consuls-Generalâ€™s enquiry or the Councilâ€™s good offices. Van Mook assured me that the Consuls-General will be given every facility.</p>

<p>He seems hopeful of setting up an Indonesian Government of occupied territory.</p>

<p>3. The general atmosphere regarding us is better than my telegram 152 [1] anticipated and I believe that now there is a good chance of Netherlands support for the Ministerâ€™s candidature.</p>
