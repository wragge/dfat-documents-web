<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>The Americans today presented simultaneously to both parties and to other members of the Committee in the form of informal and confidential oral note a draft agreement for an overall settlement. [1] Covering letter states that if both parties after consideration are prepared to accept draft as a suitable basis for negotiations the United States delegation will introduce draft into Committee as a working paper. The letter also stresses desirability at present of secrecy as to existence and contents of draft.</p>

<p>2. In substance the draft closely follows previous Australian - United States proposals. [2] It provides establishment of a provisional Federal Government following elections to a Federal representative assembly to take place [during] [3] January, 1949 3. My immediately following telegram will give a more detailed analysis of the proposals.</p>
