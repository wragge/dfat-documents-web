<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Nehru has spoken to me about Attleeâ€™s suggestion for proposed Commonwealth talks in London for finding satisfactory basis for continuing the association of India with the British Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Attlee also mentioned to Nehru the idea of sending out emissaries in advance as on previous occasions. I hope you will request Attlee that such emissaries and legal officers like Jowitt should see me in London well before any mission otherwise there might be a repetition of the Irish impasse where but for the intervention of Australia and New Zealand in London, Ireland would probably have been formally declared a foreign country. [1] That undesirable result was fortunately avoided. Similarly, in the case of India, too, I believe active assistance and drafting very earliest stage is essential so that important objective of continuing India in the British Commonwealth can be achieved.</p>

<p>Nehru is very anxious for practical suggestions from me and is giving me documentation to look over. If we can give him a hand and at the same time maintain the association of the British Commonwealth it will be a great stride towards peace in Asia. If the conference is to be held in London I hope that you will not be agreeable to any date that may conflict either with Assembly or Bank case. [2]</p>
