<p>The following is the text of two notes in question which were delivered to the German Minister for Foreign Affairs [2] by His Majestyâ€™s Ambassador at Berlin [3] on April 2nd.</p>

<p>The first note:-</p>

<p>â€˜Your Excellency, I have the honour, on the instructions of His Majestyâ€™s principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [4], to inform Your Excellency that His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom have decided to withdraw His Majestyâ€™s Legation from Vienna and replace it by a Consulate General. It is hoped to effect this change about April 15th and Mr D. St C. Gainer, C.M.G., O.B.E., at present His Majestyâ€™s Consul-General in Munich, has been selected for the post of His Majestyâ€™s Consul-General in Vienna.</p>

<p>In these circumstances I have the honour to request that an exequatur may be granted to Mr Gainer in his new capacity, and for this purpose I enclose his commission of appointment herewith.â€™</p>

<p>Second note:-</p>

<p>â€˜Your Excellency, With reference to my note of todayâ€™s date notifying the German Government of the decision of His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom to replace His Majestyâ€™s Legation at Vienna by a Consulate General, I have the honour, under instructions of His Majestyâ€™s principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform you in this connection that Ms Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom naturally reserve their position in regard to questions relating to treaties and other matters which will arise in consequence of the â€œdisappearance of Austria as a sovereign independent State.â€</p>

<p>I shall have the honour in due course to address a further communication to Your Excellency on these matters.â€™</p>
