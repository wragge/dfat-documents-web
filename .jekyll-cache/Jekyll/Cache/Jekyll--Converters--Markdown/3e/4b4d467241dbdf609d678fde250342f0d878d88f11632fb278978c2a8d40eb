<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Arising out of last paragraph your S.45 [1] proposed relief organisation, glad if you would convey following personal message to Hull from myself:-</p>

<p>Begins:</p>

<p>We are very concerned at possible exclusion of Australia from one of primary positions in connection with food relief proposals. Our approach to and work on these questions should be of greatest assistance to United Nations.</p>

<p>The suggestion that the executive is to consist of U.S.A., U.K., Russia and China would relegate important food producing countries like Australia to a secondary role. Our view in this respect is similar to that of Canada. [2]</p>

<p>Ends.</p>

<p>_1 Dispatched 17 March. On file AA:A3300, 264. It reported that Roosevelt wanted membership of the executive of the proposed relief organisation to be confined to the four great powers.</p>

<p>2 Evatt dispatched an identical message to Glasgow for delivery to Mackenzie King. See cablegram PO1 of 23 March in FA:A3196/A3831, 1942-43, folder, personal outwards cables file copies, spares and master sheets.</p>
