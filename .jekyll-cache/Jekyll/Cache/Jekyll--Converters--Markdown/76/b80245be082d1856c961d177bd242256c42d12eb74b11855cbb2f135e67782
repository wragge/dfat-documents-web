<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your E15. [1] Eaton supports report which is merely warning that final report will probably have to recommend troop withdrawals.</p>

<p>Position is that Dutch claimed areas containing many Indonesian strongholds and have been ‘mopping up’ in them. Indonesians regard every movement of Dutch as breach hence fighting inevitable.</p>

<p>Basic trouble has been that Dutch have moved along veins of a leaf and then at cease fire, drew line around, claiming all area inside as occupied by them.</p>

<p>Dutch attitude to us at Hague, Batavia and Canberra far more favourable.</p>

<p><em>1 Dispatched on 28 September, it asked whether the interim report of the Consular Commission (see Document 344) conformed to Eaton’s reports.</em></p>
