I"T<p>Cablegram 9 LONDON, 3 January 1940, 8.08 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>War Cabinet has today been considering the question of German iron</p>

<p>ore supplies from Sweden, only source still open. German stock</p>

<p>unquestionably short probably not more than three months. Supplies</p>

<p>are shipped from Narvik and Lulea but from the latter only in</p>

<p>summer. Narvik supply [sic], owing to their going through</p>

<p>Norwegian territorial waters, have to date not been intercepted.</p>

<p>Norwegian Government now being informed that owing to outrages by</p>

<p>Germany on merchant shipping in territorial waters United Kingdom</p>

<p>propose to treat such waters as open sea. Final decision will be</p>

<p>taken when Norwegian reaction is ascertained. Sweden has already</p>

<p>been approached but notwithstanding that iron ore concerned is</p>

<p>Swedish offered no objection and indicated that the matter was one</p>

<p>for Norway.</p>

<p>Question of probable action by Germany resulting against Norway</p>

<p>and for [sic] [1] Sweden was considered in conjunction with whole</p>

<p>Scandinavian position which is already under examination.</p>
