Whatever may be decided on these two matters, I am sure that you will be bearing in mind the needâ€”more pressing than ever in the present state of our relationshipâ€”to give the Australian authorities the longest possible advance warning of what is intendedâ€”perhaps in a personal message from the Chancellor to the Treasurer.</p>
