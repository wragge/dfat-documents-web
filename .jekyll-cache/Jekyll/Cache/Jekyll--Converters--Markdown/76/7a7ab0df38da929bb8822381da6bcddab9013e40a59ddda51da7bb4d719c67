I"H<p>Letter MELBOURNE, 29 April 1937</p>

<p>SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I received through the Department of Commerce a communication from Colonel Longfield Lloyd, Tokyo. [1] Lloyd, as you are probably aware, was a Military Intelligence officer before going to his post in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The communication has the following preface-</p>

<p>‘It is particularly asked that the attachments hereto be brought to the notice of Major B. Combes, General Staff, Army Headquarters, Melbourne.</p>

<p>It is expressly asked also that it be urged in the same quarter that there is increasing necessity for the most positive supervision over Northern and North-Western Australian waters, with emphasis on Darwin, regarding which area there are signs of much increased interest in Japanese official circles. A similar precaution is indicated in respect of New Guinea waters.</p>

<p>This is strongly emphasized; and there are potentialities relating to Yampi and surrounding area to which unremitting examination would be advisably directed.’</p>

<p>The attachments deal with various matters concerning the economic position in Japan and are, in fact, duplicates of reports to the Secretary, Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you have heard anything of this ‘warning’. I think you should know about it. Hence this personal note. Should you so desire, I could get it sent to you officially through the usual channels.</p>

<p>B. COMBES</p>

<p>1 Lt Col E. E. Longfield Lloyd, Trade Commissioner in Tokyo.</p>
