<p>The Prime Minister telephoned meâ€”12 July.</p>

<p>2. He said, as his annotation shows, that he had not given any policy direction that Australia House is to be transferred to Foreign Affairs. My minute was therefore, he believed, wrongly based.</p>

<p>3. He said he would need a new submission which went into the pros and cons of transfer and led up to a recommendation.</p>
