<p>PERSONAL</p>

<p>I gave Trygve Lie the message contained in your 283 yesterday. He will send a personal reply shortly but in the meantime thinks it too early to form or give any definite opinion. His view is that for the time being no approach ought to be made to any Government or person although he thinks that at the right time Aranha will help. He showed goodwill and will keep in close touch with me. I think that before sending a definite reply he will wait until he has more information especially as regards Latin Americans.</p>
