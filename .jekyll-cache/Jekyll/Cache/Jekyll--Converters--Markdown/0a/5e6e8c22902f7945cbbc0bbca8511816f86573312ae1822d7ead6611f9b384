<p>SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Indonesia matters are coming to a crisis and in the next three or four days American pressure on The Hague may decide the issue. We have been in close touch with the Americans, but Hague reports give us information we cannot otherwise get. Glad if you could arrange for Quinn to be at The Hague at any rate during the next ten days.</p>
