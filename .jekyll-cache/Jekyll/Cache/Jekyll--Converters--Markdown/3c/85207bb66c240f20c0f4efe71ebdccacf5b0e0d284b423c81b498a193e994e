I"Û<p>Cablegram 89 WASHINGTON, 16 January 1942, 1.56 a.m.</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>The significance of the contents of my telegram 73 [1] is (confidentially) as under. After my talk to the President [2] (my telegram 74 [3]) on Jan. 13th, subject matter was discussed between President and Churchill. Whether as a result of this or not (I do not know) Churchill subsequently telegraphed the British Government with the suggestion that there should be created in London a â€˜War Council of the Far Eastâ€™ on ministerial plane with Churchill presiding, on which Australian, New Zealand and Dutch Governments should be represented, to keep under continuous review the conduct of the war in the south-west Pacific theatre;</p>

<p>Churchill to be able to bring into this Council, when necessary and appropriate, the Foreign Secretary or Service Ministers when required.</p>

<p>The above not to disturb or reduce the present right of Page [4] (or whoever the relevant Australian Government representative) to attend British War Cabinet meetings whenever matters affecting Australia are under consideration.</p>

<p>The above proposal (so far as I know) has not yet been agreed upon as between Churchill and his governmental colleagues in London, and for certain reasons there may be a little delay in its consummation and your being advised. In the meantime nothing more can be done by me from here. I would be grateful if no reference might be made officially or otherwise to above by reason of fact that I am aware of it through strictly personal and non-official channels.</p>
