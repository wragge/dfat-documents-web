<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your tele[gram] of 9th May, No.114 repeated Wellington No 127.</p>

<p>Korea.</p>

<p>It is confirmed that when trusteeship proposals are accepted by the governments of the four powers, we intend to inform the governments of U.S., U.S.S.R., and China that we wish to substitute Australia for the United Kingdom as fourth member of the trusteeship body.</p>

<p>2. Arrangements agreed upon at Moscow Conference in 1945 were, as you know that (A) Joint U.S.-Soviet commission should work out proposals for a provisional Korean Government;</p>

<p>(B) The proposals should be presented for consideration of the Governments of U.S.S.R., China, U.K. and U.S.A. before final decision by U.S.S.R. and U.S.;</p>

<p>(C) Joint Commission, following consultations with provisional Korean Government should submit proposals for a four power trusteeship for joint consideration of governments of U.S.S.R., U.S.A., U.K., and China.</p>

<p>3. Exchanges between U.S. and Soviet Governments since the despatch of my tel. No.91 have ended, as you will be aware from Press reports, in agreement to resume the meeting of the joint commission with a view to proceeding as at (A) above. If and when the matter is referred to four powers for discussion in pursuance of (B) above we shall, as suggested in your Tel. No.52 of 30th January 1946, maintain close consultation with the Commonwealth Government. We think that it will be premature to try to determine at this stage the best procedure to be followed should Joint Commissionâ€™s talks break down (e.g. whether Chinese Governmentâ€™s proposal should be supported). This question will clearly require careful consideration in the light of events, of U.S. Governmentâ€™s views, and of the development of their policy as set out in my Tel. No.91 of 2nd May.</p>
