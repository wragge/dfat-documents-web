I" <p>Cablegram unnumbered 28 September 1938,</p>

<p>The whole world is grateful to you for your message to those directly concerned in the European negotiations. [1] On behalf of the people of Australia I urge that you should follow this up by offering your services as a mediator in the cause of peace. War will bring in its train evil results not only for Europe but for your own great country and ours. In the name of our common ideals I urge that you should cast the moral authority of your office and your nation into the scale of peace. We are convinced that if you could secure an extension of the time now set for the termination of negotiations war would still be averted.</p>
