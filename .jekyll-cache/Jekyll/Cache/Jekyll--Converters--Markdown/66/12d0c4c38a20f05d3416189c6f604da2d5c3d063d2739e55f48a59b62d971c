<p>Your message 22nd June. [1] Portuguese Timor.</p>

<p>As Ross is under close supervision by Japanese and is not a free agent it seems he must be under something equivalent to flag of truce. It seems to me just that he should not violate his safe conduct but return to his post at Dilli after full parley. Equally it would seem wrong for him to be forcibly detained by O/C Australian Forces. [2] I have consulted Minister for External Affairs [3] on question. He has no definite instructions for Ross, but would like him to be informed (a) of his appreciation of his efforts, (b) that he is endeavouring to obtain his inclusion in the mutual evacuation scheme for Japanese and British officials and (c) that he can still render best service to Australia, while he is in Timor, by remaining at Dilli and acquiring all information he can about Japanese.</p>

<p>Above is subject to General MacArthurâ€™s [4] approval.</p>
