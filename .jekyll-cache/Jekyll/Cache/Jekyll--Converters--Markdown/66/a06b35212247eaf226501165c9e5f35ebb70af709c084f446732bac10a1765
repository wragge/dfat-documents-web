I"«<p>Letter WASHINGTON, 3 January 1944</p>

<p>PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Now that I am back from the Conferences [1] with Mr. Churchill and</p>

<p>the Generalissimo and Marshal Stalin, I feel even more strongly</p>

<p>that you and I should meet. As you know, I have been close to</p>

<p>Mackenzie King almost since we were boys; Marshal Smuts and I</p>

<p>first met in 1918, and I had a grand reunion with him in Cairo</p>

<p>last month; and Peter Fraser has stopped off here in Washington</p>

<p>several times; and I feel that there is a real void which can only</p>

<p>be filled by a meeting between you and me.</p>

<p>I do hope that you will consider coming here within a few months.</p>

<p>It would not take you long and my thought is that you would spend</p>

<p>a couple of days at the White House, making perhaps one public</p>

<p>appearance either on the West Coast or in New York City at a big</p>

<p>meeting. Then you could run up for a day or two to see Mackenzie</p>

<p>King.</p>

<p>Incidentally and confidentially, while Churchill and I did not</p>

<p>discuss the matter in any way, I do not think it would do anything</p>

<p>but good if you could go to London for a short visit. I think you</p>

<p>would receive a very warm welcome.</p>

<p>My plans call for no definite absence from Washington for some</p>

<p>months though, of course, the military situation may change</p>

<p>suddenly making it necessary for me to dash off to a meeting</p>

<p>before that.</p>

<p>There are many things I want to talk with you about, even though</p>

<p>they are not matters which require immediate decisions. For</p>

<p>instance, I think we should discuss the future military, naval and</p>

<p>air protection of Australia and, in a preliminary way at least,</p>

<p>the disposition of the Japanese-owned mandated or controlled</p>

<p>islands. Also, I want to talk with you about the future policing</p>

<p>of the whole Pacific and Asiatic area.</p>

<p>In this country, we are all very keen about the splendid work that</p>

<p>is being done by Australia. As the head of a Government, you</p>

<p>realize as I do that when there are â€˜no complaintsâ€™ and â€˜no</p>

<p>criticismsâ€™, it means that things are going well! As we used to</p>

<p>say in my rowing days, Australia is â€˜pulling its weight in the</p>

<p>boatâ€™.</p>

<p>With my warm regards and all good wishes for the New Year.</p>

<p>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Churchill, Roosevelt and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese</p>

<p>President and, until 4 December, President of the Executive Yuan)</p>

<p>met in Cairo from 22 to 25 November 1943. Churchill and Roosevelt</p>

<p>then proceeded to Tehran for discussions with Stalin between 28</p>

<p>November and 1 December. From 4 to 6 December, Churchill and</p>

<p>Roosevelt again met in Cairo where they conferred with Turkeyâ€™s</p>

<p>President Inonu.</p>
