<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Security 518.</p>

<p>Our immediately preceding cable. [1] Following is text of resolution adopted by Council:</p>

<p>â€˜Text of the resolution on the Indonesian question submitted by the United States and amended by sub-committee appointed by the Security Council at its 217th Meeting, 31st October, 1947.</p>

<p>Security Council, having received and taken note of report of Consular Commission dated October 14th, 1947, indicating that Councilâ€™s resolution of August 1st, 1947, relating to cessation of hostilities has not been fully effective;</p>

<p>Having taken note that according to report no attempt was made by either side to come to an agreement with other about means of giving effect to that resolution;</p>

<p>Calls upon the parties concerned forthwith to consult with each other, either directly or through Committee of Good Offices as to means to be employed in order to give effect to the cease fire resolution, and, pending agreement, to cease any activities or incitement to activities which contravene that resolution, and to take appropriate measures for safeguarding life and property;</p>

<p>Requests the Committee of Good Offices to assist the parties in reaching agreement on an arrangement which will ensure the observance of the cease fire resolution. Requests the Consular Commission, together with its military assistants, to make its services available to the Committee of Good Offices;</p>

<p>Advises the parties concerned, Committee of Good Offices and Consular Commission, that its resolution of August 1st should be interpreted as meaning that use of armed forces of either party by hostile action to extend its control over territory not occupied by it on August 4th 1947, is inconsistent with Council resolution of August 1st;</p>

<p>Should it appear that some withdrawals of armed forces be necessary, invites the parties to conclude between them as soon as possible the agreement referred to in its resolution of August 25th, 1947.â€™ We feel that last two paragraphs should be interpreted as meaning that Dutch action to consolidate after August 4th was contrary to Councilâ€™s resolution [2] and accordingly withdrawal can [3] take place to prevent such consolidation or to ensure cessation of hostilities.</p>
