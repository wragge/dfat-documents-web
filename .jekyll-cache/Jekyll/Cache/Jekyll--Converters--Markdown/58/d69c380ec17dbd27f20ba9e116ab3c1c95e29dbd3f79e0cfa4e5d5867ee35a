<p>MOST SECRET AND MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Replying to your telegram M.416. [2] Proposed declaration of state of War Finland, Hungary and Roumania. We raise no objection to a very limited further delay in this long delayed transaction, but we think the greatest care should be taken to avoid defeating the main object of the decision taken by the United Kingdom Government and us which was to consult Stalin and act according to his wishes as representing an ally. (See M.341 [3], M.352 [4], M.371 [5] and our 708 [6].) We further point out- (a) Stalin has now been consulted repeatedly and has never wavered in his attitude.</p>

<p>(b) There is danger if, after delivery of an ultimatum, the period is extended without even a request by the countries concerned.</p>

<p>(c) We see little reason why the desire to add one more to Finlandâ€™s already numerous chances of retreat should result in Hungary and Roumania escaping a declaration. [7]</p>
