I"p<p>Letter NEW YORK, 30 July 1947</p>

<p>I have the honour to advise that I have today addressed the following communication to the President of the Security Council.</p>

<p>‘Under instructions from my Government, I have the honour to bring to the attention of the Security Council the hostilities which are at present in progress in Java and Sumatra between armed forces of the Netherlands and of the Republic of Indonesia, and which have been the subject of communiques by their respective Army Commanders during the past ten days.</p>

<p>The Australian Government considers that these hostilities constitute a breach of the peace under Article 39 and urges that the Council take immediate action to restore International Peace and Security.</p>

<p>In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation the Australian Government proposes that the Security Council, as a provisional measure, and without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the parties concerned, should call upon the Governments of the Netherlands and of the Republic of Indonesia to cease hostilities forthwith and to commence arbitration in accordance with Article 17 of the Linggadjati Agreement between the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia signed at Batavia on 25th March 1947. (See letter from the representative of the Netherlands to the United Nations, addressed to the Secretary- General, dated 26th March, 1947, Document S/311.) [1]</p>

<p>In view of the urgent circumstances I am instructed to request you to call immediately a meeting of the Security Council for the consideration of this communication and that the Provisional Agenda, including this item, be communicated to the representatives on the Security Council simultaneously with the notice of the meeting.’</p>

<p>I would be grateful if you could immediately bring this communication to the attention of all representatives on the Security Council.</p>
