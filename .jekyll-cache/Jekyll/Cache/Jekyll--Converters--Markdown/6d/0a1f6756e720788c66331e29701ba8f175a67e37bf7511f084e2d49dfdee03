<p>Secret Personal</p>

<p>One last noteâ€”again requiring no answerâ€”to complete my comments on recent letters about China policy. I appreciated the Secretaryâ€™s reply <a href="#f1">1</a> very much, and also your own note about the possible duration of my posting.<a href="#f2">2</a> Iâ€™ .l waitâ€”more or less patientlyâ€”and try to sort out the personal problems arising from this situation as best I can.</p>

<p>My only remaining comment is a slight variation of the view of the desirability of â€˜ritualistic negotiationsâ€™ expressed in my last letter<a href="#f3">3</a> to you. I am not convinced that we need conclude that â€™steady progressâ€™ towards normalisation of relations with the PRC is impossible because Peking shows no interest in such an approach and will not meet us halfâ€“way. It depends on how one defines â€™steady progressâ€™ ; we may have been speaking about different concepts. The Governmentâ€™s ideas about developing exchanges in other fields in the absence of recognition has never seemed very promising to me. However, unless we are wedded to that particular concept of progress, it seems to me that, even if Pekingâ€™s position remains absolutely unchanged, the way is open to us to make â€™steady progressâ€™ towards normalisation by approaching the PRCâ€™s position step by unilateral step, at our own pace.</p>

<p>2 12 July. It was written in response to a letter of 26 May in which Dunn had indicated that he found the uncertainty of his position â€˜a bit unsettlingâ€™ . He had added that he would be more satisfied to be in a place where he could â€˜do more constructive workâ€™ .mdash;though he preferred to go to another post rather than return to Canberra. In reply, Anderson replied that the Secretary sympathised with his position, and noted his desire for another overseas position, but did â€˜not feel able to make any decision at presentâ€™ .</p>
