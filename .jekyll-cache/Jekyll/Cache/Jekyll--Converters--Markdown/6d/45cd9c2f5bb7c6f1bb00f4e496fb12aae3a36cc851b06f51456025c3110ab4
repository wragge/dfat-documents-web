<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Following for Prime Minister:-</p>

<p>My telegram Circular B. 73 [1], penultimate paragraph.</p>

<p>It will be seen from my circular telegram B. 75 [2] of today that the Prime Minister in his statement tomorrow proposes to say that His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom have been glad to take note of the definite assurances given by the German Government in regard to Czechoslovakia and will render every help in their power towards the solution of questions likely to cause difficulty between the German and Czechoslovakian Governments. It is our intention to continue using all our influence with Czechoslovakian Government to produce a direct settlement with the Sudeten Deutsch and, as my circular telegram B. 73 shows, we propose to urge a similar attitude on the French Government.</p>
