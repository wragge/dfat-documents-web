<p>IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>If four power resolution [1] is adopted by Security Council a Commission for Indonesia will be established immediately. Although Belgium may seek delays it will be important for America and Australia to maintain the initiative here. I should therefore be glad of instructions as to whether I am to participate as Australian Representative in the event of Commission being set up.</p>
