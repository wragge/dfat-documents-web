<p><strong>Arrangements approved by the Minister of State for External Territories pursuant to section 25 of the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949–1968</strong></p>

<p>(a) <em>Ministerial Members</em></p>

<p>(i) In relation to matters in respect of which the Ministerial Member is to carry out his functions, and in relation to the activities of the specified department dealing with those matters, the Ministerial Member will exercise responsibility jointly with the departmental head including the exercise of such delegation, including financial delegations, as may be authorised. The management and public service aspects of the conduct of the department will remain the responsibility of the departmental head. The Ministerial Member will take part in the formulation of policies and plans and proposals for departmental expenditure, including the preparation of departmental estimates. Policy proposals may be initiated either by the Ministerial Member or by the departmental head. In matters other than those affecting the management and public service aspects of the conduct of the department the Ministerial Member and the departmental head will make recommendations or decisions jointly and these will be formally recorded on departmental papers. In the event of a disagreement between the Ministerial Member and the departmental head which cannot be resolved by consultation between them the matter will be referred to the Administrator for decision.</p>

<p>(ii) In the House of Assembly the Ministerial Member will represent the Administration by answering questions relating to matters in respect of which he is authorised to perform the functions of a Ministerial Member. He will introduce legislation relating to those matters and guide it through all proceedings in the House of Assembly. The Ministerial Member will also give the Administration view on resolutions and motions affecting these matters and generally explain and defend Administration actions in relation to them. In relation to his responsibilities in the House of Assembly it will be necessary for the Ministerial Member to co-operate with the Official Member designated as senior Official Member of the House.</p>

<p>(iii) In the Administrator’s Executive Council the Ministerial Member will represent departmental interests in relation to the matters in respect of which he is authorised to perform the functions of a Ministerial Member. These matters include the draft estimates of annual expenditure. He may also initiate proposals for legislation in respect of these matters for submission, with the agreement of the Administrator, to the Council. As a member of the Council he will also participate in the exercise of the functions of the Council generally, as set out in section 19 of the Papua and New Guinea Act.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>(iv) The effective working of these arrangements will require close co-operation between the Ministerial Member and the departmental head. In general the departmental head will tender advice to the Ministerial Member on all matters within the Ministerial Member’s competence in relation to the activities of his department. The departmental head may with the agreement of the Administrator attend meetings of the Administrator’s Executive Council.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Assistant Ministerial Members</em></p>

<p>(i) The Assistant Ministerial Member will in all cases be consulted by the departmental head wherever possible in relation to recommendations or decisions on matters in respect of which the Assistant Ministerial Member is authorised to perform his functions and the consultation will be formally recorded on departmental papers.

<p>(c) <em>All holders of ministerial office</em></p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, in the performance of their functions under section 25 of the Act, Ministerial Members and Assistant Ministerial Members should conform with the accepted code of conduct applicable in British countries to Ministers of the Crown. They should also respect the conventions that they will not publicly oppose, in the House of Assembly or elsewhere, policies or decisions that were in accordance with the advice of the Council and that they will introduce into the House of Assembly only bills and other measures which have been approved by the Administrator.</p>

<p>3 Hay responded that ‘the only comment I now have’ was to request confirmation that the word ‘will’ in the last sentence of paragraph (a)(iv) should read ‘may’. Hay asked for urgent advice ‘as we have to put the “arrangements” on a stencil this morning’ (telex 5476, Hay to Warwick Smith, 7 June, NAA: A452, 1970/4521 ). Warwick Smith replied in the affirmative (telex 284/4740, Warwick Smith to Hay, 7 June 1968, ibid.). Meanwhile, the role of Assistant Administrators (see Document 188) remained unresolved. Warwick Smith brought back from Port Moresby a draft memorandum from Hay, written in response to Document 172 and which proposed ‘an interim arrangement which will ensure that the Assistant Administrators have a responsibility of oversight in the House of Assembly and will enable them also to exercise certain oversight of Departments headed by Ministerial Members in the interim’ (draft memorandum, Hay to DOET, 3 June 1968, in NAA: A452, 1968/4245).</p>
