<p>We agree with Indian view except that we doubt the practicability of calling upon so-called stocks of United Nations Administration for the purpose. When Security Council reviews the position there may be a case for recommending expenditure by the Secretary- General from the Capital Fund although this would obviously create a precedent for other cases. We are suggesting to our mission in New York that they explore the position together with the Indian representative.</p>
