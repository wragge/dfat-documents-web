<p>277. Secret</p>

<p><strong>Talks on Indonesia</strong></p>

<p>If we are to continue to argue that efforts must be made to reconcile Indonesia and the Philippines to Malaysia so as to avoid Malaysia being exposed to their hostility and intrigue, then we may have to put forward some practical suggestions as to how this is to be done.</p>

<p>2. The present concept of the Federation of Malaysia poses a number of difficulties for Australia. It has no genuine provision for self-determination by member units and this would complicate Australia’s attitude to self-determination in the island of New Guinea.<a href="#f1">1</a> It appears that Indonesia (and apparently now the Philippines) can be expected to ask for self-determination for the North Borneo territories under U.N. auspices. Dr. Subandrio has also said publicly that Indonesia’s concern is that the people of Brunei should be given an opportunity to express an opinion as to their future status.</p>

<p>3. We are examining various constitutional aspects urgently to see whether we can devise some form of popular participation in relation to the accession of the new states to the Malayan Federation and whether some special terms modifying the existing constitution in relation to the new states might be devised.</p>

<p>4. If such an approach can be found, it might go far to allay fears and doubts of those sections of the Bomeo–Sarawak population who expressed reservations to the Cobbold Commission in the concept of irrevocable membership of the Federation (see paragraphs 4 7 , 118(i) and 123(i) of Commission’s Report.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>5. Such an approach might also open up the prospect of discussing it with the Philippines and Indonesia. We might perhaps be able to use President Ayub, President Nasser<a href="#f3">3</a> or Sihanouk<a href="#f4">4</a> to sell an idea on these lines to Soekamo. It would also, no doubt, sound better in any United Nations discussion.</p>

<p>1 Australia supported the right of both East and West New Guinea to self-determination.</p>

<p>2 Paragraph 118(i) stated: ‘a number of “ indigenous” groups considered that, during an initial period (usually put at 3–5 years), North Borneo should be at liberty to withdraw from the new Federation if her elected representatives became convinced by experience that the arrangements were not in her long term interest’. Paragraph 123(i) stated: ‘Many Chinese proposed that there should be a trial period during which North Borneo would be free to decide to leave the new Federation if she wishes’.</p>

<p>3 Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of United Arab Republic.</p>

<p>4 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State and President of Council of Ministers, Cambodia.</p>
