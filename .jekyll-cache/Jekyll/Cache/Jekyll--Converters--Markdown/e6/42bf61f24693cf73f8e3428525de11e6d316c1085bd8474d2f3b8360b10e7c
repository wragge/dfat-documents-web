<p>Your 1604-Proposed Whaling Commission. [1]</p>

<p>In general we support proposal for a whaling commission. Details of U.S. proposals are being considered and we shall forward any comments as early as possible. [2]</p>

<p>Commission should be integrated into existing international organisation and we therefore support linking with F.A.O. [3]</p>
