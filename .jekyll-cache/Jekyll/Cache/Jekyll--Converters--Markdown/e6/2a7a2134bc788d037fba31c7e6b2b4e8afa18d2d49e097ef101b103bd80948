<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>The Indians are making representations to the Foreign Office requesting renewed pressure on the Dutch as in their view the situation in Indonesia is not only not progressing but actually deteriorating. They say the Dutch are unreasonably insisting on complete cease-fire action before return to Djockjakarta, i.e.</p>

<p>before Republican Government has real chance to arrange properly for cease-fire.</p>

<p>2. I understand United States are critical of Dutch on this point, and though it has no direct information on point, Foreign Office sympathises with criticism on facts as known to it.</p>

<p>3. Your telegram 2551. [1] Yesterday Netherlands Embassy here informed Foreign Office that Dutch now hoped that Hague Conference would start on 1st August. State Department believed Conference could start on 15th July.</p>
