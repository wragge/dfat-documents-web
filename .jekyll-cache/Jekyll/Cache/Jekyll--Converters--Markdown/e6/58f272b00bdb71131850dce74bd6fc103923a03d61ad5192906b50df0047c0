I"È<p>Cablegram 12 LONDON, 7 January 1944, 1.40 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 2nd January No. 2. [1]</p>

<p>We think that the United States Government must surely be aware of</p>

<p>the position of the Commonwealth Government in this matter as set</p>

<p>out in your letter of 5th July last to Secretary of State for</p>

<p>Foreign Affairs. [2] The Communique addressed to the Portuguese</p>

<p>Government on the subject of Australiaâ€™s special interests and the</p>

<p>Portuguese reply was included in the Documents constituting the</p>

<p>Azores Agreement of which a copy was enclosed in my despatch D.</p>

<p>No. 103 of the 30th November. [3] A copy of these Documents have</p>

<p>been communicated to the United States Government. In the</p>

<p>circumstances we do not feel that the brief phrase relating to</p>

<p>Timor included in the latest Communique to the United States</p>

<p>Government regarding the proposed Staff conversations with the</p>

<p>Portuguese is capable of leading to any misunderstanding. We are</p>

<p>glad to note that you are ready to take part in Staff</p>

<p>conversations and will communicate further with you when we</p>

<p>receive the United States Governmentâ€™s reply.</p>
