I"Æ<p>Cablegram K317 BATAVIA, 16 June 1949, 11.59 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Received 17 June 1949, 9.30 a.m.</p>

<p>Both Delegations have agreed provisionally to three documents [1] for a cessation of hostilities:-</p>

<p>(a) Cease-hostilities order (b) The proclamation (c) The regulations.</p>

<p>Only minor changes have been made to the drafts already forwarded by bag.</p>

<p>2. Cochran has made the following suggestions for overcoming the procedural impasse (see paragraph 5 of my telegram K31[6] [2]). No final agreement on cease-fire until after the Republican Government is restored but Hatta to write a personal letter to Van Royen stating (1) he finds the documents in their present form reasonable and satisfactory;</p>

<p>(2) he would be prepared to urge the adoption of policy formulated in these documents by the Government of the Republic as soon as possible after its restoration;</p>

<p>(3) he would consider only the lesser details covered by the documents subject to change after consultation on the return of the Republic of Djokjakarta and by mutual agreement between the Delegations;</p>

<p>(4) he would consider as immutable the following elements of the policy formulated in documents;</p>

<p>(a) that all hostilities between the parties, including guerilla warfare, was to cease;</p>

<p>(b) that all measures shall be taken to [cease fire and terminate all acts intended to harm the other party] [3];</p>

<p>(c) that both parties shall co-operate fully in maintaining law and order, in protecting all elements of the population, and in facilitating each otherâ€™s measures of self defence;</p>

<p>(d) that the ending of military operations throughout Indonesia will render possible the maintenance of peace and order through the co-operation between the Netherlands and the Republican armed forces. Co-operation in patrolling, in avoiding clashes, and in maintaining peace and order shall be effected;</p>

<p>(e) that the armed forces of the Government shall not extend their delineated zones of patrolling or otherwise endeavour to improve their respective military positions at the expense of the other.</p>

<p>Patrols shall be limited to the maintenance of law and order, including the protection of all elements of the population;</p>

<p>(f) that there shall be neither prosecution by the course of law, nor measures of an administrative character against anyone who by the sole fact that he, by offering his services, by seeking protection or by acting in a scornful way, has taken sides in the dispute which has divided the Republic of Indonesia and the Netherlands;</p>

<p>(g) that those who have been deprived of their freedom, because of political convictions or functions, or because they have carried arms in the fighting organisations of one of the parties, shall be released as soon as possible;</p>

<p>(h) that there shall be free movement of the civilian population and free traffic of goods;</p>

<p>(i) that there shall be co-operation between parties in assuming responsibility for feeding, clothing and providing medical supplies and services for the population.</p>

<p>3. It is also suggested Van Royen reply in a similar strain to Hatta.</p>

<p>4. The Republican Delegation has taken the Dutch suggestions to the leaders at Bangka and the Netherlands Delegation is consulting The Hague.</p>

<p>5. Prospects appear hopeful but Van Royen says that the major problem is to explain the situation to the Netherlands Government, which was led to believe that the cease-hostilities agreement would be reached prior to the restoration.</p>

<p>6. It is most important that the Republican Government be restored without further delay. Anything which could be done now to urge this strongly at The Hague would be most timely.</p>

<p>_1 These three documents were drafts of the cease-hostilities orders, the joint proclamation and the Regulation governing the implementation of the agreement to cease hostilities, the full text of which is given in United Nations, Security Council Official Records, Fourth Year, Special Supplement No. 5, pp.58-62.</p>
