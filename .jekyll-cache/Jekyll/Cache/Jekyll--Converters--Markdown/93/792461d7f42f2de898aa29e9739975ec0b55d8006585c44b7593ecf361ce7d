<p><strong>Papua and New Guineaâ€”determination of functions for ministerial officers</strong></p>

<p>The Act which was recently passed by Parliament requires the Minister to approve arrangements for the functions of Ministerial Members and Assistant Ministerial Members. Attached to this submission is a proposed statement of arrangements,<a href="#f1">1</a> prepared after discussions between the Administrator and the Secretary, which is now submitted for approval under section 25 of the Papua and New Guinea Act.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>2. It is proposed that this statement be given to members of the House of Assembly at the preliminary discussion meeting which is planned to commence on the 28th May so that the members have a reasonable opportunity of considering whether they wish to accept nomination for Ministerial office before the House of Assembly meets formally. The opportunity would also occur at that meeting for the Administrator to give an exposition of how the system will work.</p>

<p>3. Under the present Administrative Arrangements Ordinance the two Assistant Administrators are responsible for certain departments of the Public Service. It would not be appropriate for Ministerial Members to be responsible to Assistant Administrators. As part of these arrangements it is proposed that Assistant Administrators shall give advice and assistance to the Administrator and perform such duties as he requires without undertaking specific Departmental functions. It will be necessary for you to approve any legislative changes as to how this is to operate before the House of Assembly opens.</p>

<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>

<p>4. I recommendâ€”</p>

<p>(a) that for the purposes of section 25 of the Papua and New Guinea Act the functions of Ministerial Members and Assistant Ministerial Members shall be in accordance with the arrangements contained in the attachment;</p>

<p>(b) that the outline in the attachment (with such verbal modifications not affecting the substance as the Administrator and I agree should be made) should be given to the members of the House of Assembly on the 28th May at the commencement of the preliminary meeting of members; and</p>

<p>(c) that recommendations for any legislative changes that may be necessary relating to how the Ministerial Member system will operate be put before you before the House of Assembly meets.<a href="#f3">3</a></p>

<p>[NAA: A452, 1970/4521]</p>

<p>1 The attachment is (as described in Document 192) identical in substance to Document 193.</p>

<p>3 Barnes approved the submission on 21 May.</p>
