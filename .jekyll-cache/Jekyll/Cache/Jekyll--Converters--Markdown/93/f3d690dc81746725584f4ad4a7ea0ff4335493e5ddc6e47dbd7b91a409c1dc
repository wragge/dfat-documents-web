<p>The Parties to this Treaty, Reaffirming their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all Governments, and desiring to strengthen the fabric of peace in the Pacific Area, Noting that the United States already has arrangements pursuant to which its armed forces are stationed in the Philippines, and has armed forces and administrative responsibilities in the Ryukyus, and upon the coming into force of the Japanese Peace Treaty may also station armed forces in and about Japan to assist in preservation of peace and security in the Japan area, Recognizing that Australia and New Zealand as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations have military obligations outside as well as within the Pacific Area, Desiring to declare publicly and formally their sense of unity, so that no potential aggressor could be under the illusion that any of them stand alone in the Pacific Area, and Desiring further to co-ordinate their efforts for collective defence for the preservation of peace and security pending the development of a more comprehensive system of regional security in the Pacific Area, Therefore declare and agree as follows:</p>

<p>_1 Spender reported in Cablegram 1228 (12 July) that the Treaty was initialled by Dulles, Berendsen and himself on the afternoon of 12 April. He added that he and Berendsen had mentioned to Dulles Caseyâ€™s query about Article VIII (see Document 103) before initialling and he â€˜thought Dulles had covered the matter during our discussion on 10 Julyâ€™ (see Document 99). Spender reported Dullesâ€™s reply that â€˜he could add no more to what he had said before and that he certainly regarded United Kingdom as a Pacific Power and therefore covered in terms of Article VIIIâ€™.</p>

<p>2 The Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States was signed at San Francisco on 1 September 1951. The text was the same as in the draft.</p>
