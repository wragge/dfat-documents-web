<p>My telegram UN 158. [1]</p>

<p>Council meeting probably Monday. Will try to telephone tonight but there are as yet no positive ideas among Council members. United States say they will ‘stand by’ commission’s report [2] without being able at this point to specify what this would mean. They do not exclude that the Council might be able without loss of authority to acquiesce in The Hague Conference provided its basis is clarified and proper status given to the Commission. This would involve considerable persuasion on the Dutch.</p>
