<p>O.JA4226 CONFIDENTIAL PRIORITY</p>

<h2 id="timor-statement-by-malik">Timor: Statement by Malik</h2>

<p>We consider it would be wrong to conclude from the ABC news item that Indonesia is moving away from self-determination in Timor.<a href="#f1">1</a> We understand that the legal procedure for incorporating East Timor into Indonesia which Malik is reported to have described is necessary regardless of whether there is an act of self-determination.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Questioned about the report TJAN (please protect) commented that the leaders of the provisional government were tough and stubborn men. They considered the declarations of integration being made by areas of East Timor under their control as part of the act of selfÂ­-determination.</li>
  <li>Indonesia, Tjan said, would explore Winspeareâ€™s proposals before deciding the form of any act of self-determination.</li>
  <li>Our present assessment is that Indonesia would like to follow Winspeareâ€™s recommendations, but would do so only if it is sure that integration would be the result. We doubt that Indonesia will hesitate to reject Winspeareâ€™s proposals if it does not liketnem. (Indonesiaâ€™s attitude towards the United Nations and other foreign involvement in the East Timor problem has hardened recently. Their cynical approach is illustrated by the coincidence of the moves reported in our JA4209<a href="#f2">2</a> and Winspeareâ€™s visit.)</li>
  <li>Nevertheless we believe the Indonesians will seek to present whatever means is chosen to incorporate East Timor as an act of self-determination. As you know President Soehartoâ€™s policy guideline is that the incorporation should be achieved as â€˜legallyâ€™ as possible.</li>

  <li>1 Cablegram CH308880 (14 January) reported an unattributed news item broadcast on the ABC on 14 January. It quoted Malik as having announced that the Provisional Government of East Timor had invited Indonesia to declare its sovereignty over the territory. Malik had indicated that the PGET had â€˜droppedâ€™ the idea of an election in East Timor in favour of the passing of a law declaring the territory part of Indonesia. DFA requested Jakartaâ€™s response to this adding: â€˜The report is a disturbing one as it seems to indicate that the Indonesians are moving away from self-determination in Timorâ€™.</li>
