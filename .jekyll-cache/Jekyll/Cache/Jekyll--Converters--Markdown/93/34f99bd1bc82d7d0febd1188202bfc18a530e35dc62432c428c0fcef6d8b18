I"[<p>Cablegram 430 (extract) [1] CANBERRA, 10 July 1941</p>

<p>MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Reference your M.140 and 141. [2]</p>

<p>1. NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES</p>

<p>Further consideration has been given to plans under which</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government will provide Army units to reinforce Ambon</p>

<p>and Koepang and also an air striking force at Darwin to operate</p>

<p>from advanced bases to be established in collaboration with the</p>

<p>Netherlands East Indies authorities at these localities. [3]</p>

<p>It is considered that authority of Netherlands East Indies should</p>

<p>be obtained for the despatch of these forces as soon as southward</p>

<p>movement is made by Japan. It is also desired that consideration</p>

<p>be given to seeking the concurrence of the Netherlands East Indies</p>

<p>to movement in anticipation of Japanese action. In any event,</p>

<p>authority is desired by Army and Air Force authorities to despatch</p>

<p>advance parties in uniform immediately. [4]</p>

<p>Chief of the Naval Staff [5] is examining the position in regard</p>

<p>to shipping requirements and availability of vessels.</p>

<p>2. R.A.N. SHIPS</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Government will no doubt have prominently in</p>

<p>mind my discussion regarding disposition of R.A.N. ships in event</p>

<p>of war with Japan and your assurance that every endeavour will be</p>

<p>made so to judge the situation that the ships in the</p>

<p>Mediterranean, together with the Australian forces in the Indian</p>

<p>Ocean, are redisposed so as to reach Australian waters, on, or</p>

<p>shortly after, the outbreak of war with Japan. [6]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>MENZIES</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 This cablegram embodied decisions made by War Cabinet earlier</p>

<p>the same day (see minute 1176 in AA : A2673, vol. 7). It was</p>

<p>repeated to the N.Z. Govt and to the Legation in Washington as nos</p>

<p>255 and 68.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 9 July. On file AA : A1608, A41/1/6,v. They dealt</p>

<p>with the likelihood of a Japanese advance and outlined possible</p>

<p>measures to be taken if it were directed southwards.</p>

<p>3For previous consideration of this question, see Documents on</p>

<p>Australian Foreign Policy 1937-49, vol. IV, Documents 366, 40S and</p>

<p>504.</p>

<p>4The U.K. Govt replied on 7 August (cablegram 549 on file AA :</p>

<p>A981,Japan 185B, ii):â€™We have not so far taken any action to</p>

<p>approach the Netherlands Government further in this matter since</p>

<p>we had felt that it would be useless to approach them with a</p>

<p>specific proposal on the question of reinforcement of Ambon and</p>

<p>Koepang unless we were in a position to deal with a counter</p>

<p>request from the Dutch which they would no doubt make for some</p>

<p>assurance of support in the event of their territory in the Far</p>

<p>East being attacked. As to the question of an assurance please see</p>

<p>my Circular M. 215 of 6th August [Document 34].â€™</p>

<p>5Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin. From 4 March to 17 July Colvin was</p>

<p>officially on sick leave and Commodore J. W. Durnford was</p>

<p>appointed to act as Chief of Naval Staff. Colvin, however,</p>

<p>continued to fulfil the duties of the position on some occasions.</p>

<p>6 Menziesâ€™s London discussions had arisen out of the Commonwealth</p>

<p>Govtâ€™s dissatisfaction with the imprecision of the naval plan</p>

<p>discussed at the 1940 Singapore Conference. See Documents on</p>

<p>Australian Foreign Policy 1937-49, voL IV, Documents 285, 287,</p>

<p>300, 343, 366-7 and 400.</p>
