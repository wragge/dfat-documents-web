I"Ò<p>Cablegram 146 [1] CANBERRA, 25 August 1943</p>

<p>PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 8 to Australia. [2] War Crimes Commission.</p>

<p>Australia agrees with your insistence that Soviet Government must be made to understand constitutional and international position of Dominions. I therefore suggest that in any representations in Moscow, Canadian Minister should act in co-operation with Australian Charge dâ€™Affaires. It is intolerable if status of Dominions is to be questioned in this way. [3]</p>

<p>At the same time I think Canada should be very careful when combined bodies are being set up with United States and United Kingdom to recognise that Australiaâ€™s status is equivalent to that of Canada and I am sure you will understand that we feel as strongly on the matter as you do.</p>

<p>I have heard reference to a proposed combined body to deal with mutual aid. Why Australia should be omitted from such a body I quite fail to understand. [4] I am quite sure you will not fail to co-operate with Australian High Commissioner in Ottawa and regard yourself as representing Australia when for obvious reasons we can have no Australian responsible Minister on the spot. Best wishes.</p>

<p>3 Evatt dispatched a message to Eden the same day stating his support for the Canadian proposal and insisting that it was â€˜of cardinal importance that status of Dominions should not be open to questionâ€™. He also advised that Officer had been instructed to make joint representations with the Canadian Minister in Moscow.</p>

<p>See cablegram 140 (FA:A3196, 1943, 0.23284).</p>

<p>4 Glasgow advised on 26 August that the Joint War Aid Committee was a purely Canadian-United States body established to co- ordinate the operations of the two main suppliers of Lend-Lease aid. See cablegram 151 on file AA:A989, 43/735/580.</p>

<p>5 Glasgow advised Evatt on 30 August that he had spoken to Mackenzie King, who had welcomed Evattâ€™s suggestion of joint representation and agreed that both Dominions should have equivalent status. See cablegram 156 on the file cited in note 4.</p>
