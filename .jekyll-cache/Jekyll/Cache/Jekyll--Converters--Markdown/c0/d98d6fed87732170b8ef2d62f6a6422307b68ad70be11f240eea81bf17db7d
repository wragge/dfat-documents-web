<p>Unnumbered Top Secret Immediate</p>

<p>From Clark.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>Your message 115 of 21st December.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>1. In the event of Australia <em>not</em> recognizing the Communist Government in China at the same time as other members of the Commonwealth, Australian representatives in China may be expected to receive even worse treatmentâ€™ than Americans who are anticipating trouble and removing all surplus personnel.</p>

<p>2. Following repercussions may be expectedâ€”</p>

<p>(a) I seriously doubt if even unofficial contacts with local Communists will be possible.</p>

<p>(b) Unfavourable Press comments mainly on the lines of Australia being nothing but â€˜running financial (rest of quotation corrupt)â€™ revival of a certain ranting [against?]<a href="#f3">3</a> our White Australia policy.</p>

<p>(c) We may well expect such incidents as happened to Ward and other Americans in Manchuria<a href="#f4">4</a> with possible eviction.</p>

<p>3. Should Canada offer recognition and <em>not</em> Australia, Australiaâ€™s attitude will be regarded as a result of Australiaâ€™s hatred of Chinese people and coloured races personnel generally.</p>

<p>4. Nonâ€“recognition would seriously prejudice future Australian trade with China which has great possibilities as soon as the Communist Government commences reconstruction.</p>

<p>5. Even a short delay after recognition<a href="#f5">5</a> is likely to build up a feeling of distrust which will render trade relations most difficult.</p>

<p>1 Col. A.G. Clark, Australian Military AttachÃ©, Nanking.</p>

<p>2 It explained that the United Kingdom, India, South Africa, and perhaps other Commonwealth countries might accord recognition well before Australia would do so. Clark was asked to be prepared for such a situation, and to urgently cable his views on the position that would pertain to Australian representatives and nationals in Shanghai and Nanking.</p>

<p>3 A word appears to have been missing in the original.</p>

<p>4 See footnote 2, Document 2.</p>

<p>5 Apparently, reference here to recognition is intended to denote recognition by other Commonwealth countries.</p>
