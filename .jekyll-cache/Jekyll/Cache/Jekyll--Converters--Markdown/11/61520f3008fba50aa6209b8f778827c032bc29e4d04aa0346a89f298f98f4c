<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia.</p>

<p>1. It is now two weeks since the Security Council made its decision on cessation of hostilities and arbitration. The two parties are no nearer agreement on means of arbitration.</p>

<p>2. The Security Council must maintain its position and delaying tactics should no longer be permitted.</p>

<p>3. You should at the next meeting immediately move that the Security Council, noting that there is no agreement by the two parties, should appoint a commission of arbitration and also a commission to observe the carrying out of the cease fire and of the results of arbitration. We would suggest commission[s] of 3 and 5 respectively elected by the Council.</p>
