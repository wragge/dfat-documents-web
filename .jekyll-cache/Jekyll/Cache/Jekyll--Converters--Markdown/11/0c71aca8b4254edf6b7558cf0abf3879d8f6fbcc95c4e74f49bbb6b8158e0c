<p>PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>On re-reading my telegram [1], I feel that the final suggestion- which, in any event, you may regard as impracticable-might appear to qualify the preceding statement that I am prepared to fall in with your wishes.</p>

<p>This is not so. I leave it to you to determine where I shall be most useful.</p>

<p>If you decide for Washington, I would ask that appointment should only be for a limited period and that I should, in any event, return to London if serious negotiations were entered into for a peace settlement.</p>
