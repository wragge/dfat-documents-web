<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>I agree that the exclusion of the British Dominions from the Council of Foreign Ministers is a matter for protest and further representations for this practical recognition of the sacrifices made by the Dominions in the European theatre. I am repeating to you my telegram to the Secretary of State on this subject [1], and I propose to send a further personal message to Attlee drawing attention in particular to the most unsatisfactory attitude adopted towards Australia and New Zealand in the Dominions Office reply to your telegram.
