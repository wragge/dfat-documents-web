<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your 248. [1] Please reply: Australia along with some other Governments has given recognition to de facto authority of Republican Government. [2] Question of diplomatic relations was not determined before hostilities began. Consequently question of formal representation of Republican interests does not arise.</p>

<p>However, in accordance with my Governmentâ€™s previous offer of good offices, which still applies, I would be glad to assist the Republican Government in facilitating negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the present situation.</p>
