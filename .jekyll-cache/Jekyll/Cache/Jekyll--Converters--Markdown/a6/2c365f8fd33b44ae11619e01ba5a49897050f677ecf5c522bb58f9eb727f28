<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia.</p>

<p>Director of the political section asked me to call urgently this morning.</p>

<p>2. He spoke with some heat of the Australian attitude at the last meeting of the Security Council and the repetition of [suggestion] the Dutch Government were delaying proceedings. [1] He referred to repeated assurances that they desired early implementing of the cease-fire (my telegram 214 [2]). They had hoped when they accepted Australia remaining on the Commi[ttee] of Three that there would be no hostile criticism in the Council until the Commi[ttee] verbally reported (my telegram 207 [3] paragraph 7).</p>

<p>Finally he doubted the wisdom of their advice to the Prime Minister to accept the invitation to Australia [4] as they felt that in the present atmosphere the visit would be useless.</p>

<p>3. As I have only brief and unsatisfactory press report of the Council meeting, I could not discuss that aspect but emphasised again the value of Kirbyâ€™s work and my hope that the Prime Ministerâ€™s visit would take place. But for the time being the atmosphere here is very cold like that of early August (see my telegram 134 [5]).</p>

<p>1 See Document 480. Hoodâ€™s statement to the Security Council referred to â€˜tendencies towards delayâ€™ in the implementation of the cease-fire and to reports of movements by Dutch forces which, if substantiated, would not be in accord with the intentions of the Council in issuing the cease-fire order. See also Document 474.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched on 11 December, it reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had assured Officer that the Netherlands Government desired a peaceful settlement and that it believed that the first step had to be a complete cessation of hostilities.</p>
