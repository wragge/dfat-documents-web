<p>At the Lapstone Conference we were told United States vote with Dutch was to prevent Dutch setting up interim government without Republic. We warned that tactics were wrong and their vote would be regarded as encouragement. Please ascertain what is next step proposed by State Department suggesting that time has come for more realistic approach and that it would be helpful to all concerned if there could be more consultation between us. We have been in continuous touch with Embassy here and they have transmitted informal notes setting out our point of view and seeking comments, but we have had no responses.</p>
