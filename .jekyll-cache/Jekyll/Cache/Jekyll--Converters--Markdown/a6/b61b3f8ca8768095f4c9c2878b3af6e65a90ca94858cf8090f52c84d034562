<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram D. No. 233 of 15th March.</p>

<p>We have been thinking over arrangements for discussions between Prime Ministers which are to begin next month, and it may be helpful if I try to set out topics which might, if you agree, come up in course of discussions. These come under following heads:-</p>

<p>(1) Defence questions affecting particularly United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, especially United States request for bases in Pacific islands.</p>

<p>(2) Foreign policy (a) generally, (b) in relation to future of Germany and Japan.</p>

<p>(3) Future of Italian Colonies and any other questions arising out of peace treaties with ex-enemies other than Germany and Japan.</p>

<p>(4) Atomic energy.</p>

<p>(5) Trusteeship.</p>

<p>(6) Defence cooperation in forms suitable for the differing circumstances of the various members of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Should be grateful for your comments on above, and for any further suggestions which you may have as to possible agenda for discussions. [1] Ends.</p>

<p>1 Chifley replied on 10 April that he would prefer to see discussions centre on item (1), with talks on other matters of common concern as opportunity allowed.</p>
