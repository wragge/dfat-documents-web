<p>China Policy</p>

<p>With reference to Mr Renoufâ€™s telegram 1350<a href="#f1">1</a> (attached), which we did not see until after the preparation of our other submission to you today on his talk with Mr Huang, we are of the view that there would be no point in going back to Mr Huang about the â€˜fallaciesâ€™ unless and until the Government were to decide to enter into negotiations about the establishment of diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>2. The fact is that we now have what almost (but not quite) amounts to a â€˜One China, Two Rival Governmentsâ€™ position (though it would be unwise to say so publicly); and though this was not listed among Mr Huangâ€™s â€˜fallaciesâ€™ . it figures in the Nixonâ€”Chou communique<a href="#f2">2</a> as one of the â€˜activitiesâ€™ which the PRC â€˜firmly opposesâ€™ .</p>

<p>3. All in all, it would seem better to leave matters stand and to wait and see whether Peking, after digesting what Mr Renouf had to say, wishes to resume the dialogue.</p>
