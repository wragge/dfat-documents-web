<p>6. CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p><strong>Consultative Committee</strong></p>

<p>Your E. 14.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>We agree with the proposal to hold next meeting of Consultative Committee in Karachi on 24th March and have so informed Pakistan Government.</p>

<p>As you suggest, meeting of officials could be about a fortnight earlier with date for despatch of completed questionnaires and country chapters for report set at 1st February.</p>

<p>We agree that when venue is decided, host Government should invite International Bank and non-participating non-Commonwealth countries in the area to send observers.</p>

<p>Preliminary drafting of report might be undertaken in London using, for example, persons serving on Commonwealth Liaison Committee expanded for this purpose by representatives of relevant non-Commonwealth countries, including especially the United States.</p>

<p>Our comments on agenda will follow as soon as possible.</p>
