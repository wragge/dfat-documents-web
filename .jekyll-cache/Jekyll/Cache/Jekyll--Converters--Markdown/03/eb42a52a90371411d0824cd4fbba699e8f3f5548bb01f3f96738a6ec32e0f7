<p>EMERGENCY CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL</p>

<p>1. I had a discussion this afternoon with Attlee and he stated the position in Hong Kong and his policy in China very much on lines of messages which you have received. [1] I told him that your statement as contained in message was the sound general policy and that the position in Hong Kong might not develop unsatisfactorily especially if the general attitude towards the Chinese Government followed the lines of Australian policy. [2] I also suggested that if there appeared to be any actual threat against Hong Kong the matter could with propriety be brought before the Security Council by any interested country including the United Kingdom or Australia and this might result in the appearance before the Council of persons who could speak for North China. He was in general agreement but anxious about the possibility of Australian help from Japan in relation e.g. to medical personnel.</p>
