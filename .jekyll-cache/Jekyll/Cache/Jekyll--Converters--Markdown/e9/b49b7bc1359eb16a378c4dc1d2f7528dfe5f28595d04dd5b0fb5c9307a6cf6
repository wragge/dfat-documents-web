<p>Japan and G.A.T.T.</p>

<p>The Committee’s discussion related to the letter of 9th October, 1953, from the United Kingdom High Commissioner to the Prime Minister proposing that United Kingdom and Australia support a proposal for Japanese participation in the G.A.T.T. subject to specific safeguards. The Committee also had before it a draft telegram prepared by Lord Swinton, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, in anticipation of Australian acceptance of the proposal.</p>

<p>The Committee discussed at some length the Japanese application for accession to the G.A.T.T. and the implications of the current proposals for a form of limited Japanese participation while the application for accession is pending.</p>

<p>It was agreed that (1) As far as Australia is concerned the Japanese application for accession should follow the recognised G.A.T.T. procedures.</p>

<p>(2) The Australian Delegation should not support proposals which in effect extended special concessional treatment to Japan.</p>

<p>(3) Previous instructions to the Australian Delegation to the 8th Session of the G.A.T.T. Contracting Parties (Cabinet Decision 808 of 13th August, 1953 [2]) to abstain from voting or questions relating to Japanese accession on participation should be confirmed.</p>

<p>(4) The Prime Minister would convey the substance of this decision to Lord Swinton.</p>
