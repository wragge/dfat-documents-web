<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Your 180. [1]</p>

<p>While your scepticism about Batavia talks (your 182 [2]) is shared, we are of the opinion that it might be unwise at this stage to discuss with India a resolution as comprehensive as the one contained in your 181. [3] Indonesia, which will probably be admitted to the Agenda by the Plenary tomorrow, is unlikely to be discussed in committee 1 [4] for some time. In any case we have in mind something more simple and less likely to contradict the intention of Article 12 [5] of the Charter. We have regarded the presence on the Agenda and full discussion as being equally important tactically as a resolution, and it would be unwise to take any step likely to prejudice what small chance the Batavia talks have of success. Whatever form the resolution takes the assembly will be doing no more than expressing an opinion, and the less satisfactory the Batavia talks are the stronger this is likely to be. Everything, therefore, is to be gained by taking the item as late as possible and by keeping our freedom of action intact. We have been in touch with the Indians here who agree that it is not yet time to talk about specific resolution.</p>
