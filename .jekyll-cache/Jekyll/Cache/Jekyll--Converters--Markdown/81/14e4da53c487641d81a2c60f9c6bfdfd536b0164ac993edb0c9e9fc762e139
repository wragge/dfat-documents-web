<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your 284 and 285. [1] Indonesia.</p>

<p>1. The Security Council debate lasted all day. Earlier statements by China, India, Soviet Union covered general ground only. First reference to the position described in your telegrams was made by Australia. Discussion thereafter was concerned mainly with this.</p>

<p>By fortunate chance a United Nations press release from Batavia reporting suspension of negotiations was distributed during the meeting and we were able to frame our statement accordingly on the lines of para two of your 285.</p>

<p>2. Support from the United States was disappointing, possibly because of lack of instructions but the upshot of the meeting was that the president proposed and Council agreed to request from Committee of Good Offices, the Australian-American document [2] and also a report on the whole circumstances of the suspension of discussions. We stressed that this should be provided at the earliest possible time and argued also for early date for the next discussion on Indonesia in Council. It was finally decided that discussion should be resumed on Wednesday 23rd June.</p>
