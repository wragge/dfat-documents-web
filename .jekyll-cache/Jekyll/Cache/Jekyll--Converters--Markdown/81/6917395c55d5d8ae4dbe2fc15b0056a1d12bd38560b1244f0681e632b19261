<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>[On 12 March 1940 Finland signed an armistice which surrendered the Karelian Isthmus and other areas of economic and strategic importance to the U.S.S.R.]</p>

<p>Finland</p>

<p>While no official confirmation of terms agreed on there appears little doubt but that press reports accurate. Undoubtedly the fact that Finland has to capitulate and accept such drastic terms will seriously affect Alliesâ€™ prestige. Daladier [1] attempted last night in his not entirely unimaginative picture of what the Allies prepared do to assist Finland to minimize the effect but doubt if it or any other statement win do much to counteract unfortunate repercussions of the fact itself.</p>
