<p>The Australian Government has no wish or desire to intrude upon those negotiations or discussions between the United Kingdom and the EEC Governments which relate to matters which are not Australiaâ€™s business, and does not assert a claim to be a principal in those negotiations. On the other hand, the Australian Government would regard it as anomalous and indeed inequitable if Australia, with its traditional trade ties with one of the parties to the negotiations, should be denied any part in the discussions and be absent from them even when matters profoundly affecting its economic future are being decided.</p>
