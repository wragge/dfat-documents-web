<p>Following from Melville for the Minister for External Affairs and the Treasurer.</p>

<p>Employment Resolution.</p>

<p>1. At the final session of the Commission III(iii) the compromised Resolution referred to in our 31 [1] was adopted. New Zealand sought without success to have the clause on employment strengthened. We argued that we could not support a Resolution which did not recommend a specific agreement on employment and expressed the view that â€˜the harmonising of national policiesâ€™ of employment had little meaning.</p>

<p>2. We urged separate Australian resolution [2] and made a statement of our attitude. The vote was taken without further discussion, the United Kingdom, France, Poland and a few smaller countries voted with us but the resolution was not accepted.</p>

<p>2 See paragraph 84 of the Attachment to Document 260.</p>
