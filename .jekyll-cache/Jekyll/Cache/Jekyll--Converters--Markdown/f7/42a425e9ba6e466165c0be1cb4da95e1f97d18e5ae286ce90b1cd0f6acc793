In the meantime, you may be interested to see the following summary of the additional requirements from Australia and New Zealand which the British Chiefs of Staff suggest:—</p>

<p>‘We list in the following paragraphs additional requirements for further forces, etc., in the provision of which Australian and New Zealand contributions would be most useful if a request for help was made by the Government of Malaysia.</p>
