<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Every effort has been made last 24 hours to prevent the French fleet falling into German hands by urging it must be placed beyond Government control before German terms received. While assurances dishonouring terms would not be accepted (and surrender of the fleet is such a term) have been repeated it has been impossible to obtain any action. First Lord [2] and First Sea Lord [3] have gone to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Anglo-French Declaration now published [4] and French Government, which would carry on in similar manner to Dutch, now appears a possibility. Difficult to forecast how this would come about, but might be [by] resignation of Petain Government on ground that terms unacceptable, followed by Government pledge to carry on the struggle, or by Government including Laval [5] and Flandin [6] which would accept terms. In latter event, Government would be repudiated under leadership of Herriot, President of the Chamber of Deputies, and Jeanneney, the President of the Senate, who would form a Government and carry on from somewhere outside France.</p>

<p>No definite information as to German attitude to the French Governmentâ€™s request, but Press indicate likely to be very drastic.</p>

<p>Spain. Latest reports far from reassuring and any appreciation of the future conduct of the war must envisage a hostile Spain. In separate cable I send certain questions to which I have asked for an answer. [7]</p>
