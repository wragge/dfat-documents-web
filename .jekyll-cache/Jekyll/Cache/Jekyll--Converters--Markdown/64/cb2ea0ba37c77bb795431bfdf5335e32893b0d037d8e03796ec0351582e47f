<p>2 On 5 October 1939 Lt Col W.R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, wrote to F. Strahan, Secretary of Prime ministerâ€™s Department, to tell him that he had discussed with his Minister, Sir Henry Gullett, whether in view of the outbreak of war it was advisable to take action to implement the Cabinet decision. The Minister directed that, while the matter was to be kept in mind, no action was to be taken for the present. (See AA:</p>
