<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram No. 288. [1] As it is important to give extremist elements no excuse for picking a quarrel with the Netherlands East Indies, particularly on basis allegations of encirclement, I urge that no public statement be made at present offering or suggesting Australian support or assistance to Netherlands East Indies and that press should exercise great discretion.

<p>1 Dispatched 11 June.

Cabinet said to be divided in opinion. â€˜See file AA: A1608, A41/1/6, v.</p>

<p>2 The Commonwealth Govt repeated the substance of this cablegram to the U.K. Dominions Secretary, Lord Cranborne, in cablegram 365 of 13 June. See file AA: A1608, N41/1/1.
