<p>TIMOR</p>

<p>My telegram 716. [1] Ambassador at Lisbon [2] has now reported as follows: â€˜Oil Concessions have an exclusive concession covering 4,000 square miles. The company have undertaken to negotiate with Wittouck [3] for payment of compensation in respect of expenditure he has incurred in Timor for the purpose of satisfying scruples of Minister of Colonies [4] regarding Wittouckâ€™s moral rights. If satisfactory agreement is arrived at the Minister will grant remaining area about 1,500 square miles to Oil Concessions. Wittouck has no legal rights in the island and [5] the Minister cannot grant concession in respect of remaining part until negotiations with Wittouck have taken place. Japanese have no hope of getting an oil concession.â€™ According to secret sources previously referred to, Japanese Minister [6] still actively telegraphing his government, e.g., asking that the Consul General at Sydney [7] should endeavour to ascertain whether Oil Concessions are backed by Wales Bank.</p>
