<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your 983. [1]</p>

<p>1. Regarding the South Seas Commission my feeling is that in all the circumstances including shortness of time, the first conference to establish the South Seas Commission, which will [be] on the official not the ministerial level, should be limited to the three British Commonwealth Nations who in London agreed to establish the Commission. [2]</p>

<p>2. If the United States, France or Netherlands informally express a desire to be associated we could extend formal invitations. It is important not to invite those whose acceptance is at all uncertain.</p>

<p>3. Subject to 2, I have no objection whatever to the participation of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>4. If the United States, France and the Netherlands do not attend the first meeting, the Commission could subsequently consider extending the area of participation.</p>
