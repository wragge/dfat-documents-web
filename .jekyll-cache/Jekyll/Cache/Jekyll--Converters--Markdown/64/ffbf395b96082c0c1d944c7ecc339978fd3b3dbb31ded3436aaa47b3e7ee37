<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>The Committee today telegraphed the Security Council its report on the breakdown of direct talks between parties. [1] Annexed to the report are separate accounts of the breakdown received from each party (K.205 and 206), the Australia - United States plan [2], the United States plan [3], and the Dutch amendments [4] to the latter.</p>

<p>2. Combination of report and annexes, read in conjunction with introduction of fourth interim report [5], should make it clear to the Security Council that one party desires a settlement while the other does not, and, that failure to reach a settlement will inevitably mean most serious disorder and further hostilities in Indonesia.</p>

<p>3. The conclusions drawn by the Committee in the report are:-</p>

<p>(a) The collapse of direct talks has served to aggravate dangers in an already grave situation, reported in introduction to fourth interim report.</p>

<p>(b) The establishment of an Interim Federal Government, without the Republic, will contribute further to Republican opinion that the Netherlands have been proceeding unilaterally to the establishment of a United States of Indonesia on its own terms, and without the Republic, will greatly complicate a negotiated settlement of Indonesian dispute, and could create serious unrest in Indonesia.</p>

<p>(c) In the light of the Netherlands statements the Committee does not foresee the possibility of its bringing parties together in bona fide negotiations.</p>

<p>(d) The Committee envisages a further deterioration of truce and the intensification of factors already making for further economic deterioration, general unrest and social upheaval. Widespread hostilities involving conflict of organised armed groups on a large scale may be the outcome.</p>
