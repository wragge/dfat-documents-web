<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>TIMOR</p>

<p>My H524 [1] and telegrams Nos. 616 [2] and 3. [3] Further</p>

<p>information now available from â€˜secret but entirely trustworthy</p>

<p>sourceâ€™ referred to in previous telegrams.</p>

<p>(1) In a telegram to the Japanese Minister at Lisbon [4] on 24th</p>

<p>November the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs [5] referred to</p>

<p>Japanâ€™s desire to proceed in due course to develop Timorâ€™s oil</p>

<p>resources and urged him â€˜to bear in mind the great importance of</p>

<p>the question in relation realization our national [fuel] [6]</p>

<p>supply scheme and also as an offset to the American â€œstringent</p>

<p>embargoâ€ against Japanâ€™.</p>

<p>(2) On 4th December the Japanese Minister at Lisbon reported to</p>

<p>the Minister for Foreign Affairs that â€˜it will be quite impossible</p>

<p>for us to gain our desired objectives by means of ordinary</p>

<p>negotiations. Judging from Portugalâ€™s treatment of Belgian</p>

<p>interests and from unjust suspicions that Bitoqueâ€™s (presumably</p>

<p>Wittouck [7]) activities with a view to getting oil rights are</p>

<p>being carried out in co-operation with Japan, there is reason to</p>

<p>suspect that Portuguese have decided definitely not to grant such</p>

<p>concessions to Japanâ€™.</p>

<p>(3) On 21st December the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs</p>

<p>telegraphed to the Minister at Lisbon: â€˜We consider that we must</p>

<p>make use of Macao to break this deadlockâ€™, instancing the cutting</p>

<p>of land and water communication in order to induce an acute food</p>

<p>shortage, or occupation of the coast opposite Macao. Pointing out</p>

<p>that he wanted to attain his objective if possible without</p>

<p>resorting to such pressure he authorized the Minister â€˜to make</p>

<p>dear our demands and, if they persist in refusing to reconsider</p>

<p>the matter, to hint in a roundabout way at pressureâ€™. He added:</p>

<p>â€˜It is quite possible that as you say the machinations of Great</p>

<p>Britain are behind this business so it may be necessary to</p>

<p>negotiate with Great Britain too, depending on how the matter</p>

<p>developsâ€™.</p>

<p>(4) On 22nd December the Japanese Minister at Lisbon reported home</p>

<p>that Australian contract was now as good as settled. He asked the</p>

<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs: â€˜Do your instructions mean that you</p>

<p>intend to dispute the monopoly of the Australian company over the</p>

<p>area in which they have the concession?â€™ i.e. east of longitude</p>

<p>125 degrees 50 minutes east. He pointed out that â€˜an early</p>

<p>withdrawal of the Australian monopoly is link[ed] up with</p>

<p>closeness of relations which bind the Portuguese Government with</p>

<p>Britishâ€™. He urged that Japan should try to acquire rights in the</p>

<p>district west longitude mentioned above comprising roughly one-</p>

<p>third of Portuguese Timor and having established a footing bide</p>

<p>her time until a proper opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>(5) On 30th December the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs</p>

<p>replied:</p>

<p>â€˜Although we should be satisfied if Saptâ€™s [8] entry into the</p>

<p>field were permitted, what I believed to be essential was that the</p>

<p>monopoly itself should be disputed and that Portuguese should be</p>

<p>made to be to [sic] first to suggest a definite scheme for a</p>

<p>compromise. If we endeavoured to acquire concession for the</p>

<p>western territory that would be tantamount to overlooking for the</p>

<p>time being fact of other party being in possession and I would</p>

<p>therefore prefer not to make such a proposal as yetâ€™.</p>

<p>(With regard to the proposed pressure on Macao you will remember</p>

<p>similar reports to this effect early in 1939.)</p>
