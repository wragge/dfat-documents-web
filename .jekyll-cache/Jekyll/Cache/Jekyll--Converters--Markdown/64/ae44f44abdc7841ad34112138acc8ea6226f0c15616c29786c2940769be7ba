<p>SECRET</p>

<p>The Palestine Committee completed work at four oâ€™clock this afternoon. Dr Evatt has received high praise for his Chairmanship.</p>

<p>There is great relief that the Committee has come to a final vote.</p>

<p>Dr Evatt had consultation with myself regarding the matters of our vote. We both strongly agreed that abstention would leave the worst impression possible, particularly with roll-call vote.</p>

<p>Partition seemed only course and should simplify the position of United Kingdom. Resolution carried 25 to 13.</p>

<p>Dr Evatt left New York this evening en route to Chicago and San Francisco. He is greatly fatigued and in need of a good rest. His efforts have been greatly praised by observers here.</p>
