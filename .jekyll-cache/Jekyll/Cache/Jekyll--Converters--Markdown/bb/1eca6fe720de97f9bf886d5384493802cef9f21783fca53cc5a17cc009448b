<p>WOOL FOR JAPAN</p>

<p>We have no desire create embarrassment in United Kingdom relations with United States but we must again emphasize our special interest in the adoption of a more active policy in sales to neutrals. We must ask that United Kingdom Government, during forthcoming discussions, keep constantly before them our special position vis-a-vis Japan and necessity to avoid embarrassment to us except for the most vital Empire reasons.</p>

<p>Have noted United Kingdom assent to arrangement with Japan till end April.</p>

<p>Central Wool Committee have made some progress in persuading Japanese to take merino wool without reduction total monthly purchase.</p>
