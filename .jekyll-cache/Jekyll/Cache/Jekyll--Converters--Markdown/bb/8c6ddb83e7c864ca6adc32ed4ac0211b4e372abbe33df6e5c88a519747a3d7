<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Japanese Peace Settlement.</p>

<p>1. You will recall General MacArthurâ€™s statement that he considered an early peace settlement desirable. [1] Macmahon Ballâ€™s reports clearly indicate that MacArthur is facing increasing economic difficulties and that political trends are not as favourable as he has been indicating. [2]</p>

<p>2. Just before MacArthurâ€™s statement, I urged in the House [3] an early settlement, but for different reasons. Unless there is an early settlement at which the active belligerents with a right to participate are present, major decisions will continue to be made piecemeal.</p>

<p>3. Since my statement, Macmahon Ball has sent reports indicating that political control is gradually going back to reactionary groups. [4]</p>

<p>4. I have in mind to suggest immediate talks among those members of the British Commonwealth concerned, at which could be discussed both the Japanese settlement and the current control problems.</p>

<p>This need not be on ministerial level but should, I think, take place in Canberra in near future. I should appreciate your co- operation.</p>
