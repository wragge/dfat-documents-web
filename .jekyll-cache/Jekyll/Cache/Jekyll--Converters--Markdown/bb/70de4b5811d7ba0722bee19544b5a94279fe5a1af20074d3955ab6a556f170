<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister from Mr. Winston Churchill on accepting His Majestyâ€™s invitation to fill the office of Prime Minister- â€˜I send you my warmest greetings and my grateful thanks for your cheering message. [1] The responsibility which has fallen to me in this solemn hour is lightened by the fact that it is shared by you and the other Prime Ministers of the overseas Dominions.</p>

<p>The peoples of the British Commonwealth once again united in arms against a cruel barbarism are resolved to wage this righteous war to the end.â€™</p>
