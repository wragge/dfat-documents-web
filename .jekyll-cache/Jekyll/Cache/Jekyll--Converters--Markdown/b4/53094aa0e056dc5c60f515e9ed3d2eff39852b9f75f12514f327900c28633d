<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Reference your No. 58 [2], it is noted that the only senior Australian officer proposed to be provided on the Staff of the Supreme Commander is the Deputy of the Administrative Branch. As Australia is to have three divisions and possibly a fourth one in this area, this is quite unacceptable to the Commonwealth Government.</p>

<p>We strongly hold the view that the General Officer Commanding A.I.F. [3] should be given a status that will ensure he is fully consulted in regard to all operational, administrative and other plans in so far as they affect the A.I.F.</p>
