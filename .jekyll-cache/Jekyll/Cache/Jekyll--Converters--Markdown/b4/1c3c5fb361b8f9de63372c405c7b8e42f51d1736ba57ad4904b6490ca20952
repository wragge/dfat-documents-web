I"Í<p>Cablegram 2 CANBERRA, 2 January 1944</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your D.1190 and your No. 398. [1]</p>

<p>1. The Australian Government regards it as essential that there</p>

<p>should be a frank understanding of the arrangement made in London</p>

<p>in July between Mr. Churchill, Mr. Eden, Mr. Attlee and Dr. Evatt</p>

<p>in relation to the protection of Australian postwar interests in</p>

<p>Timor including Defence, Trade and Communications. [2] We cannot</p>

<p>forget that no assistance whatever was received by us from</p>

<p>Portugal at the crucial time and even if Portugal now proposes to</p>

<p>engage in active combat With Japan the arrangement made is</p>

<p>necessary to protect our interests.</p>

<p>2. in the circumstances we regret that your proposed communication</p>

<p>to the United States Government was not submitted to us in the</p>

<p>first instance. For instance the phrase â€˜The Liberation of Timorâ€™</p>

<p>might suggest to the United States an absolute restoration of</p>

<p>Portuguese sovereignty without any of the necessary qualifications</p>

<p>or addenda. Presumably Australiaâ€™s special interests, having</p>

<p>already been made clear to the Portuguese, will be made equally</p>

<p>clear to the United States Government.</p>

<p>3. With regard to Staff conversations we are quite prepared to</p>

<p>take part in these.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Dispatched 29 and 28 December respectively. On file AA:A989,</p>

<p>E43-44/970/54. These cablegrams advised of U.K. proposals to the</p>

<p>United States concerning the â€˜considerable advantagesâ€™ of</p>

<p>Portugalâ€™s entry into the war against Japan, and urged staff talks</p>

<p>in London by U.K., U.S., Portuguese and Australian officers to</p>

<p>â€˜draw up a plan of Portuguese co operation in the war against</p>

<p>Japanâ€™.</p>
