<p>SECRET</p>

<p>We have been advised by Netherlands Minister here that action will be taken very shortly to declare â€˜Communist activityâ€™ illegal in Indonesia. Minister gave assurance that this would not be directed against Republic as such but against certain cells within Republican regime.</p>

<p>2. He was advised informally that in our view the only way of preventing the spread of Communist influence is by making immediate settlement with present moderate Republican Government.</p>

<p>3. Please report fully on any action that is taken.</p>
