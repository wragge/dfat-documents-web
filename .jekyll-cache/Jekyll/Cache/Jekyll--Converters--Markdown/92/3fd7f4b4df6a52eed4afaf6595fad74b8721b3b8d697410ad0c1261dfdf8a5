<p>MOST PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL FOR MR BRUCE</p>

<p>Following on appointment Minister at Washington it is felt initial steps should be taken to implement one of the early declarations of the Government that Legation would also be established at Tokyo.</p>

<p>To this end desire you ascertain through appropriate channel whether proposal to establish Australian Legation at Tokyo would be acceptable to King. It is not proposed to go beyond this initial step for the time being and I shall advise you after receipt of His Majestyâ€™s reply of further steps desired to be taken.</p>
