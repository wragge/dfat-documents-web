I"£<p>Cablegram Hag 107 THE HAGUE, 13 August 1948</p>

<p>[SECRET]</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Drees, speaking in Second Chamber yesterday, said that discussions here with the BANDOENG DELEGATION [1] had strengthened the conviction that agreement would be reached with the representatives of these territories which would lead to (a) the establishment of a truly Indonesian federal interim Government;</p>

<p>(b) the institution of a United States of Indonesia;</p>

<p>(c) the simultaneous formation of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union.</p>

<p>2. He then referred to disappointing relations with Republicans which he attributed to (a) non-implementation of Renville Agreement, (b) increasing number of violations of truce â€˜in which Republican authorities have on more than one occasion had a handâ€™.</p>

<p>3. He stressed importance of Republicans taking their place in United States of Indonesia and gave an undertaking that Netherlands would honour its obligations.</p>

<p>4. I regard the speech as rather disappointing but will discuss it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister with both of whom I have appointments early next week.</p>
