I" <p>CANBERRA, 6 March 1945</p>

<p>The Government of the United States of America, on behalf of itself and of the Governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of China, invites the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to send representatives to a Conference of the United Nations to be held on April 25, 1945, at San Francisco in the United States of America to prepare a charter for a general international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security. [1]</p>

<p>The above-named Governments suggest that the Conference consider as affording a basis for such a charter the proposals for the establishment of a general international organization, which were made public last October as a result of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and which have now been supplemented by the following provisions for Section C of Chapter 6:</p>

<p>‘C. Voting.</p>

<p>1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.</p>

<p>2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members.</p>

<p>3. Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter 8, Section A, and under the second sentence of Paragraph 1 of Chapter 8, Section C, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.’ Further information as to arrangements will be transmitted subsequently. In the event that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia desires in advance of the Conference to present views or comments concerning the proposals, the Government of the United States of America will be pleased to transmit such views and comments to the other participating Governments.</p>
