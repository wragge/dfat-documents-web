<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Addressed to the Prime Minister. Civil Affairs.</p>

<p>My telegram 131 of 27th October. [1]</p>

<p>The United Kingdom authorities last night produced a long Aide- Memoire which they describe as â€˜result of prolonged inter- departmental consideration of proposals of Commonwealth Governmentâ€™. (The full text has been sent to you by air mail bag to-day, External Affairs Despatch S.200. [2]) I went this morning to a meeting for a preliminary discussion of the Aide-Memoire but I took the line that they must wait for your considered reply. Meanwhile I rubbed it in that our great concern was the maintenance of British prestige in the Pacific and that we felt there was a grave danger of this slipping back. It was absolutely essential that machinery should be set up in order to avoid developments which might prejudice final settlement in the Pacific area.</p>
