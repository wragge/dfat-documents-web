I"¢<p>Cablegram Hague 52 THE HAGUE, 14 April 1947, 7.09 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Reference your telegram 38. [1]</p>

<p>1. I called on Van Vredenburch today and again strongly urged along the lines contained in your telegram 38 that the decision concerning the visas should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>2. I was advised that the situation remained as reported in my Hague 51 [2] and that the Netherlands Charge dâ€™Affaires at Canberra would not be authorised to issue the visas for the reasons already stated.</p>

<p>3. I was told informally- (A) That reports published concerning Dutch-Indonesian negotiations on economic matters were misleading and in fact these are still at a delicate stage;</p>

<p>(B) That the Netherlands Cabinet (vide my telegram 51 paragraph 5) was in session and would remain in session until late this evening;</p>

<p>(C) That if Cabinet did review its decision I would be informed immediately.</p>

<p>4. I am of the opinion that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not expect Cabinet at this juncture to reverse its decision.</p>
