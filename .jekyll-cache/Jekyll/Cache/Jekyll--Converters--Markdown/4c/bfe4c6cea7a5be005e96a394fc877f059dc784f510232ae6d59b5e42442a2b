<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 14 of 22nd August. [1]</p>

<p>Dâ€™Argenlieu. [2] Further points contained in Mr. Menziesâ€™ telegram 4714 of 25th August [3] were brought at Once to the notice of the United Kingdom Government who referred them to the Free French Headquarters. I have just received reply from the United Kingdom Government setting out the answer of Cassin (Secretary of the Free French Defence Council and now Commissioner for justice and Education on the National Committee). Cassin points out that de Gaulle [4] received Sautotâ€™s [5] offer to resign but replied stating that he had every confidence in the Governor. According to Cassin dâ€™Argenlieuâ€™s functions were in no way confined to â€˜Gouvernement localâ€™ and while he would have large civil powers, the main purpose of his mission would be the Organisation of defence of French possessions throughout the Pacific area. He ended â€˜La situation de Gouverneur Sautot dans son ile reste intacteâ€™. The High Commissioner for the Western Pacific [6] also expresses ideas about dâ€™Argenlieuâ€™s appointment similar to those set out in Mr. Menziesâ€™ telegram and Cassin asked that Luke be advised that dâ€™Argenlieuâ€™s appointment was in no way due to intrigue of Brunot [7] but principally to military needs and also to the internal situation in Tahiti. There was nothing he said in this matter which in any way reflected on Sautot.</p>
