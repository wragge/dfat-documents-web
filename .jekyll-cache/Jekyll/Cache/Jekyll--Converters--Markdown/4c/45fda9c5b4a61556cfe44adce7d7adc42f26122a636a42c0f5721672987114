<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 812. [1] Commonwealth Government desires Portuguese Government to issue authorisation to Governor [2] to make local request for military assistance and Australian Forces would give all assistance within their limited resources. We agree similar authority to invite Dutch assistance should be issued.</p>

<p>We think there is ample evidence of Japanese designs upon territory as scheme of Japanese strategy includes taking possession all possible bases and Japanese have already established so-called civil air service between Dilli and Pelew.</p>

<p>For this reason Portugal might well be requested to invite Allied troops to protect her possession even at this stage.</p>
