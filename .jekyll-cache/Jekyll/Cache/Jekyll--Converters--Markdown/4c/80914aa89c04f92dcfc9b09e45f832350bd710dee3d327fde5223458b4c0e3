I"j<p>Cablegram 30 WASHINGTON, 30 May 1940</p>

<p>SECRET FOR BRUCE</p>

<p>I have shown my telegram No. 106 to Canberra and No. 29 to London [1] to Lothian [2] who thoroughly agrees with line I have taken.</p>

<p>He is cabling Foreign Office accordingly and you should see his telegram No. 868 [3] and show Foreign Office my telegram referred to above.</p>

<p>1 Document 319.</p>

<p>2 U.K. Ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>3 In PRO: PREM 4/43B/1. Lothian asked the U.K. Govt to see Bruce’s copy of Casey’s cablegram 106 and commented: ‘I think the line which Casey has taken with Sumner Welles is exactly right at this moment … The expert politician in the President is always trying to find a way of winning the war for the Allies and if he fails to do that of ensuring security of the United States without the United States itself having to take the plunge into the war … I think that Casey’s interview coming from one who cm speak authoritatively for the Empire will do much to shatter the present paralysing illusion in the President’s mind.’</p>
