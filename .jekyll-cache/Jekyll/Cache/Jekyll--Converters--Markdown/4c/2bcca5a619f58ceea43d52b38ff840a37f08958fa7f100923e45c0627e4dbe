I"¼<p>Cablegram 224 NANKING, 13 September 1949, 11.01 a.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>First sentence of paragraph 4 of my telegram 223. [1] Question of recognition and when it is accorded has to be decided in Australia in the light of far more information than is available to us here and probably after consultation with other interested States. 2.</p>

<p>But my opinion is that it should be accorded very early for the sooner we are represented here on a proper basis the better.</p>

<p>Otherwise we (a) leave the field to the U.S.S.R. who I assume will recognize the new Government as soon as it is formed;</p>

<p>(b) can do nothing to further Australian (and British) views and interests.</p>

<p>I can see no argument for what I gather to be the United States attitude, viz. to delay recognition, and I have told both the United States Ambassador before he left and the officer now in charge of the Embassy so. It amounts to [an abdication of] [2] any influence here and gains nothing.</p>
