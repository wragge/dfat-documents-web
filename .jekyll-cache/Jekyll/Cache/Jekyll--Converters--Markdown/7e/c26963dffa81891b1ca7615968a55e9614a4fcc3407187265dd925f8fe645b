I"˜<p>Cablegram 254 LONDON, 22 June 1939</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 40. [1] Foreign Office advise question future position of Czech Ministers and Consuls in the United Kingdom is at present under consideration and it is felt no definite opinion can yet be expressed as to the procedure for us.</p>

<p>Should it be decided to withdraw the Czech Ministers from the diplomatic list here, it is thought it will be unnecessary to issue new exequaturs to German consular representatives in the United Kingdom because an exequatur only specifies the limits of a consulâ€™s jurisdiction over members of the country in which he resides not the limits of jurisdiction over a country he represents. It is also considered unlikely that German Consular representatives will receive any written intimation that they have jurisdiction pertaining to citizens Bohemia and Moravia.</p>

<p>I have asked the Foreign Office to advise me immediately the position with regard to Czech Minister [2] and Consul [3] in United Kingdom is clarified.</p>
