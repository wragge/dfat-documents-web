<p>PERSONAL HIMSELF SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram of28th October [1]: Matter has now been fully examined with the First Lord of the Admiralty [2] and the Board of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Admiraltyâ€™s attitude with regard to a capital ship for the Royal Australian Navy is the same as when the matter was discussed with Page and Menzies. [3] Difficulty is the method of provision.</p>

<p>The present number of capital ships in the Royal Navy is small and a proportion are undergoing refitting. In these circumstances and as a result of discussions I do not see any prospect of the transference of a capital ship from the Royal Navy to the Royal Australian Navy in the near future or at any date much in advance of the deliverance of a new ship.</p>

<p>With regard to the suggestion re Singapore, for the same reasons do not think that an arrangement to operate in the near future could be arrived at.</p>
