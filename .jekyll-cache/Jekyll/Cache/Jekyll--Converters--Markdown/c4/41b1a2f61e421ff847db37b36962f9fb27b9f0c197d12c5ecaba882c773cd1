<p>11201 Confidential Priority</p>

<p><strong>Gazelle plan of action</strong></p>

<p>Minister has considered your 614 of 23rd November<a href="#f1">1</a> and related messages and before approving a plan of action, some elements of which as indicated are contingent upon further decision, as follows would like to have any comments from you:â€”</p>

<p>(a) <em>Local government</em></p>

<p>(1) Immediate elections of ward committees in wards in which these are wanted on basis of existing boundaries with Council allotting powers to them. (Immediate statement.)</p>

<p>(2) Immediate action to review ward boundaries in preparation for (3) below lncluded in this review will be an examination of the position of small non-Tolai settlements (e.g. Kokopo ward is 100% non-Tolai and urban in character) with a view to deciding whether these two or three wards could be included in Rabaul urban government area or otherwise dealt with so as to remove causes of Tolai antagonismâ€”a Departmental message has been sent on this matter (approval would be on a contingency basis which could not be acted on without further specific ministerial approval).</p>

<p>(3) Elections in about September 1970 on basis revised ward boundaries. Such elections to cover both main council and ward committeesâ€”(this would also be a contingent approval).</p>

<p>(4) Maintain principle that if MA do not want European or non-Tolai members they should oppose them electorallyâ€”(immediate statement).</p>

<p>(5) Tax collection to be enforcedâ€”but as far as possible by distraint not gaolâ€”this would be a straight-out ministerial approval.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Land</em></p>

<p>(1) Development Bank to continue subdivision of Matanatar and Revalienâ€”future purchase and subdivision of plantations in traditional Tolai area to follow similar principlesâ€”(this relates to an existing ministerial approval).</p>

<p>(2) Administrator to report on possible action under Land (Underdeveloped Freehold) Ordinance in respect ofâ€”</p>

<p>(a) Rabaul</p>

<p>(b) Gazelle Peninsula</p>

<p>(c) Areas outside Gazelle which are capable for use for Tolai resettlementâ€”â€”this is a new proposal arising from the legislation recently passed by the House of Assembly on which urgent comments would be appreciated</p>

<p>(3) Administration disposition of land on border of Tolai areas to be based on the principlesâ€”</p>

<p>- when the land is suitable subdivision should be based upon normal resettlement schemes</p>

<p>- blocks shall be allocated on leasehold tenure only</p>

<p>- specially constituted land boards will ensure that Tolais take decision on who shall receive blocksâ€”this again recites existing ministerial approvals</p>

<p>(c) <em>Courts</em></p>

<p>(1) Additional judge or acting judge to be appointed so that court may expedite determination of pending land casesâ€”the Minister is approaching the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>(2) Court to be asked by the Minister to arrange sitting in Rabaul until land appeals are completedâ€”the Minister has in mind to write to the Acting Chief Justice when he informs him of the proposal for a further judge.</p>

<p>(d) <em>Legislation</em></p>

<p>(1) Identify those powers which are needed but which are not at present available and which would be acceptable under ordinary law such asâ€”</p>

<p>- extended provisions for binding over to keep the peace (including restricted residence or movement)</p>

<p>- control of societies and public collection of funds</p>

<p>- moving on</p>

<p>- extension of present power, eg over assemblies and marches other than in public places as well as in themâ€”this has been discussed with Curtis on the telephone and we hope that firm proposals can be evolved at a meeting in Canberra next week which would include the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department.</p>

<p>(2) Legislation on these lines (which will clearly be directed at controlling activities of MA) to be introduced at a special meeting of the House of Assemblyâ€”the Ministerâ€™s approval in this respect would be contingent and depends upon developments. We should however be glad to know when a decision [would need to be taken if the House were to meet in the week beginning 14 Dec].<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>(3) Preparation of ordinances that might be packaged under description â€˜special legislationâ€™ such asâ€”</p>

<p>- curfews</p>

<p>- restriction [of] residence by an administrative act</p>

<p>- detention without trial</p>

<p>(3) <em>Operational aspects</em></p>

<p>(1) Administration places responsibility for maintenance of law and order clearly in hands of Police Commissioner</p>

<p>(2) Administration ensures proper training and action by (i) police and (ii) DDA</p>

<p>(3) Liaises with services.</p>

<p>(4) Administration operates through AEC as far as possible</p>

<p>(5) Administration decides line of control Special Branch</p>

<p>- Ministerâ€™s approval is again contingent and I should be glad to receive your recommendations in regard to these and other operational aspects</p>

<p>(6) Department is in contact with Defence on logistic support including aircraft to move police</p>
