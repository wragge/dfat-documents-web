<p>TOP SECRET IMPORTANT</p>

<p>Control of Japan.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary, in reporting as in my telegram of to-day D.</p>

<p>No. 2277 [1] says that he has done his best at Moscow to secure (a) Separate United Kingdom and Australian representation in the Allied Council in Tokyo.</p>

<p>(b) Change in the proposed voting procedure in the Far Eastern Commission so as to avoid one power veto, and (c) Consultation on both sets of terms of reference with other powers on the Far Eastern Commission.</p>

<p>2. He thinks it likely however that Mr. Byrnes and M. Molotov will maintain their opposition on both points and he considers that there is practically no chance of securing (a). If the United States and Soviet opposition is maintained further insistence on the part of United Kingdom would be incompatible with objective of securing co-operation of the Soviet Government in Far Eastern affairs and would result in the United Kingdom being blamed for holding up an agreement which if not ideal would at least offer hope of progress on co-operative lines.</p>

<p>3. If the Foreign Secretary is faced with this situation he proposes to fall back on the principle of one British member of the Allied Council representing jointly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and India as those parts of British Commonwealth whose forces are to participate in occupation of Japan; he intends to press for continued inclusion of India in Far Eastern Commission and subject to this being secured he would agree to presentation of terms of reference as amended to the other powers on Far Eastern Commission by United Kingdom, United States, Soviet and Chinese Governments.</p>

<p>4. Cabinet have considered the position and reached the conclusion that in circumstances Foreign Secretaryâ€™s proposals represent most satisfactory solution of question that is likely to be obtainable.</p>
