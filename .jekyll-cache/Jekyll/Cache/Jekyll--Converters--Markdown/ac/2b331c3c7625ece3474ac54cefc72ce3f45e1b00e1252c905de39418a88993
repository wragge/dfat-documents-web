<p>IMPORTANT MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Please communicate to the Prime Minister [1] for his Most Secret</p>

<p>and Personal information the following appreciation of the</p>

<p>military position in the Middle East which has been prepared by</p>

<p>the Chiefs of Staff. It is being communicated also to His</p>

<p>Majestyâ€™s Ambassador at Cairo [2], Commander in Chief India [3],</p>

<p>and Commanders in Chief of the Middle East [4] and the</p>

<p>Mediterranean. [5]</p>

<p>(begins).</p>

<p>The retention of our position in the Middle East remains of the</p>

<p>utmost importance to the successful prosecution of the war,</p>

<p>particularly in view of our policy of an economic blockade of</p>

<p>Europe. It is also important to secure the Anglo-Iranian oil</p>

<p>fields.</p>

<p>2. The security of the Middle East hinges on the defence of.-</p>

<p>(a) Egypt and Sudan, where our main forces are based, our Middle</p>

<p>East communications are centred, and the Suez Canal is controlled.</p>

<p>(b) Iraq, from which we must control the oil of Iraq and Iran and</p>

<p>safeguard the Baghdad-Haifa route.</p>

<p>(c) Palestine, which is now our most northerly defensive position</p>

<p>and contains the western terminus of the Baghdad route.</p>

<p>(d) Aden, which is essential to our Red Sea lines of</p>

<p>communication.</p>

<p>(e) Kenya, which is our second line of defence in Africa, a</p>

<p>valuable base of operations against Italian East Africa and</p>

<p>contains a second alternative line of communication to Egypt via</p>

<p>Mombasa.</p>

<p>3. It is of first importance that the Red Sea route should be</p>

<p>rendered secure as soon as possible and very considerable success</p>

<p>has already been achieved in reducing the Italian air and</p>

<p>submarine threats to it. Development of air route to route</p>

<p>Nigeria-Geneina (Sudan) as reinforcement route for aircraft and</p>

<p>light stores to Egypt is being pressed on, as is work on Baghdad</p>

<p>and Mombasa alternative routes.</p>

<p>4. Our policy in the Middle East must at present be generally</p>

<p>defensive although every chance of taking local offensive action</p>

<p>will be continued. Although difficulties of terrain, climate and</p>

<p>communications in Libya are limiting factors, the possibility of</p>

<p>attack on Egypt by German forces from this area is undoubtedly a</p>

<p>serious threat calling for increased scale of defence. Our present</p>

<p>forces are sufficient to deal with any purely Italian attack as</p>

<p>long as we can retain the Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. The</p>

<p>Italians could now muster between 300 and 400 bombers in Libya but</p>

<p>their morale is indifferent and maintenance poor. Although the</p>

<p>German Air Force is likely to be fully occupied in the near future</p>

<p>in attacks on the United Kingdom, their participation in air</p>

<p>attack on Egypt is not impossible and Alexandria might be rendered</p>

<p>untenable as Fleet base.</p>

<p>5. It is hoped that Turkey would oppose a German or Italian attack</p>

<p>through the Balkans on the Middle East. Although we cannot rely on</p>

<p>her to offer prolonged resistance, the threat to the Middle East</p>

<p>from this direction is comparatively a long term one. It is</p>

<p>important that Syria should not fall into enemy occupation. If the</p>

<p>status quo is to be disturbed by our enemies it is clearly</p>

<p>desirable that Turkey should resist. From the military point of</p>

<p>view the Turkish occupation of Syria would have much to commend it</p>

<p>though there would be political disadvantages.</p>

<p>6. The defence of Iraq is compromised by the situation in Syria</p>

<p>also by the possibility of disturbance of the internal situation</p>

<p>and by the growing hostility of Iran. Subject to agreement with</p>

<p>Iraq Government it is intended to reinforce Iraq with one division</p>

<p>from India.</p>

<p>7. Although we cannot count on the continuance of French</p>

<p>resistance at Djibouti, the success of our action against Italian</p>

<p>air and submarine threats promises well for the future security of</p>

<p>the Red Sea route.</p>

<p>8. It is intended to retain the fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean</p>

<p>as long as possible.</p>

<p>9. For the above reasons it is clearly necessary to strengthen our</p>

<p>defence forces in the Middle East at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>The situation is, however, governed by the probability of large</p>

<p>scale air offensive and even invasion of this country in the near</p>

<p>future and shortages of equipment to meet these threats. Our</p>

<p>policy must therefore be to concentrate our immediate efforts on</p>

<p>the defence of the United Kingdom and to start releasing equipment</p>

<p>for the Middle East when we can more clearly judge the situation</p>

<p>following the impending trial of strength here. This may not be</p>

<p>for two months, meanwhile we shall endeavour to send anything we</p>

<p>can spare, including if possible modern fighters, to re-equip</p>

<p>squadrons in Egypt and bombers to replace wastage. [6]</p>

<p>6 A supplement to this appreciation was received in cablegram Z183</p>

<p>dispatched on 13 July. It reported that the threat of invasion of</p>

<p>the United Kingdom was likely to end in September and the enemy</p>

<p>might then turn his attention to the Middle East, where major</p>

<p>operations were anticipated throughout the autumn and winter of</p>

<p>1940-41. It was hoped that the 6th Australian and 2nd New Zealand</p>

<p>Divisions could be reconstituted in the Middle East by the autumn</p>

<p>or early winter and that the Commonwealth and N.Z. Govts should</p>

<p>continue to prepare reinforcements for dispatch to the Middle East</p>
