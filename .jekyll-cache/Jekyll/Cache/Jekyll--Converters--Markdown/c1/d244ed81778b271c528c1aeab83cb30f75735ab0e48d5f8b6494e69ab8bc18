<p>SECRET</p>

<p>As you know, Fourth Session of Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is due to begin in Australia on 29th of this month.</p>

<p>We are anxious to avoid if possible a protracted dispute on the question of admission Indonesian Republic to associate membership such as has taken place at last two sessions. [1]</p>

<p>2. So far we have had no official indication that the Republic intends to send a delegation to this session. If a delegation arrives and applies for associate membership we shall of course do everything possible to ensure its admission in some capacity or other.</p>

<p>3. Please sound out Republican Government urgently as to its intentions.</p>
