I"<p>Canberra, 20 November 1962</p>

<p>On 26th October we received a copy of a letter addressed on 19th October to the Home Secretary by Sir Eric Harrison, <a href="#f1">1</a> in which Sir Eric asked for an assurance that the provisions of the Commonwealth Immigrantsâ€™ Act, 1962 will be applied against Australian citizens with some discretion in the future. After reading this letter, I wondered whether we were not putting our case a little too strongly. For instance, would we be prepared to give a similar assurance to that sought by Sir Eric if the British were to make similar representations on the operation of our own Immigration Act.</p>

<p>By and large, I believe that Australians wishing to enter Britain are being treated pretty fairly in terms of the British legislation. During the drafting stages of this legislation I had several talks with Norman Costar, and I believe that the British went a long way to meet our prospective difficulties by amendments to the legislation and instructions.</p>

<p>I note that two of the three cases mentioned by Sir Eric concern sailors, who are from their very calling something of a foot-loose body of men and were a source of trouble to the British authorities before the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrantsâ€™ Act.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you and Sir Eric are on the spot and may well have good reasons why you believe that particular individual cases should be taken upâ€”perhaps to establish an administrative principle of some importance to us.</p>

<p>My suggestion is, however, that I believe the Commonwealth Immigrantsâ€™ Act is operating very lightly as far as we are concerned and that we should avoid doing anything unnecessary which might lose us the sympathy of the British.</p>
