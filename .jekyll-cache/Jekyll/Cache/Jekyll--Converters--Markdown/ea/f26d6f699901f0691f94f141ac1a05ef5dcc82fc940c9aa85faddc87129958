I"H<p>Cablegram 36 LONDON, 12 January 1940, 7.10 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram [1], which arrived in time for the Prime Minister</p>

<p>[2] to read at the commencement of the War Cabinet this morning,</p>

<p>was invaluable. After full discussion it was decided to abandon</p>

<p>the contemplated action. Closest contact with the Norwegian and</p>

<p>Swedish Governments is to be maintained and desirability of</p>

<p>sending the Lord Privy Seal [3] to Scandinavia was discussed.</p>

<p>Personally I consider that such action would be ill-advised and I</p>

<p>anticipate that on further examination idea will be abandoned.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
