<p>977. Secret</p>

<p>While there is still no overt evidence that the revolt was inspired or materially assisted by Indonesia Sukarno has predicted that the rebellion will succeed and Abdulgani<a href="#f2">2</a> has suggested that the press should take the side of the rebels (see our telegram 972).<a href="#f3">3</a> However, apart from the Communist and Communist-influenced press we have, so far, seen no major editorial playing up this.</p>

<p>.. ,<a href="#f4">4</a> Martadinata<a href="#f5">5</a> was explicit when talking to Jones yesterday that he had no knowledge of any Indonesian activity and said that he would have expected to know if anything was going on. But we would not assume Martadinata would, necessarily, know or admit that he knew.</p>

<p>On the whole the publically expressed official Indonesian attitude has, up to now, shown as great a degree of restraint as could reasonably be expected in view of undoubted Indonesian sympathy for the rebels. But unless the revolt fizzles out the temptation to assist the rebels may become irresistible. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Indonesia will refrain indefinitely from reacting to remarks by Tunku Rahman, such as his accusations of Indonesian complicity.</p>
