<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 4054. [1]</p>

<p>I called on Sjahrir morning of 25th September. He expects to be in London another week during which he will see Attlee and Bevin, to put the Indonesian case in a general way. He hopes to go from here to Australia ‘if nothing intervenes’. He promised to let me know early next week his definite movements.</p>

<p>2. Sjahrir expressed great pleasure at Kirby’s appointment, but regret that the Belgian appointee, Van Zeeland should be a ‘conservative’. He expressed appreciation of all Australia had done and seemed genuinely anxious to visit Australia.</p>

<p>3. Dr. Subandrio has established in the last few days an office in London as ‘Indonesian representative’ and I will keep in touch with him.</p>

<p>4. Sjahrir is not aware whether Oesman had returned to Indonesia.</p>

<p>I said I had no information, but assumed so, as I had no recent references to him in Australian publications. [2]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Dispatched on 23 September, it instructed Heydon to ascertain whether Sjahrir (then in London) would be prepared to visit Australia to discuss the work of the Committee of Three.</p>

<p>2 Usman had not returned to Indonesia.</p>
