<p>1 Dispatched 23 February. It reported difficulties experienced by the British Military Mission and the Australian Legation in obtaining information concerning liberated prisoners of war, in particular in interpreting Article 2 of the British-Soviet agreement giving Britain rights of access to ‘points of concentration’. In an apparent attempt to 1imit such access, the Soviet Govt had so far refused to name any point of concentration other than Odessa. In AA:A1066, IC45/6/2/1, i.</p>

<p>2 See Document 34. A second communication was mentioned in cablegram 40.</p>
