I"Ö	<p>Cablegram 339 1 July 1940,</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In furtherance of the declared policy of fostering and developing</p>

<p>friendly relations in countries on the Pacific, Australia has</p>

<p>established a legation at Washington, and as you are aware has</p>

<p>taken the formal steps to establish one immediately at Tokyo.</p>

<p>We have ample evidence that Japan was disappointed that the Tokyo</p>

<p>and Washington Legations were not established simultaneously.</p>

<p>For some time the Consul-General for China [1], acting on definite</p>

<p>instructions from his Government, has been pressing for the</p>

<p>establishment of a legation in China simultaneously with that in</p>

<p>Japan. He has renewed representations during the past week. [2]</p>

<p>We have given consideration to this question in our review of the</p>

<p>general Far Eastern and Pacific situation this week.</p>

<p>From the aspect of post war economic and political conditions, on</p>

<p>the assumption that a substantial portion of China will remain</p>

<p>under the control of the National Government and by virtue of our</p>

<p>adherence to the League resolution to do nothing to weaken the</p>

<p>position of China in the face of Japanese aggression, a case can</p>

<p>be made out for the establishment of such a legation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we feel that such a step may be resented by</p>

<p>Japan, and would nullify the favourable effect of the decision in</p>

<p>regard to Tokyo.</p>

<p>It has already been suggested by Japan that Australia should</p>

<p>recognise the new order in Eastern Asia, as specifically referring</p>

<p>to the Wang Ching Wei Government. [3]</p>

<p>The position in the Far East is so unstable at the moment that it</p>

<p>is not inconceivable that the United Kingdom Government itself may</p>

<p>have to consider the advisability of recognising the latter</p>

<p>Government.</p>

<p>We do not wish to take any action which may irritate Japan while</p>

<p>at the same time we have a friendly feeling in relation to China.</p>

<p>Before arriving at a definite conclusion, I would be glad to have</p>

<p>the views of the United Kingdom Government on the question.</p>
