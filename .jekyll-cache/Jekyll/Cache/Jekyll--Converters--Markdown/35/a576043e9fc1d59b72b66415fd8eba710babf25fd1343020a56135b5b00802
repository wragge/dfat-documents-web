I"Ä<p>Cablegram N39 LONDON, 3 December 1943, 6.46 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Your telegrams N.2 and N.3. [1] Two definite and separate issues are involved:</p>

<p>(1) an arrangement with the Dutch for post-war defence and economic co-operation in respect to the islands north of Australia; and, (2) van Mookâ€™s contemplated migration to Australia. [2] With regard to (1), I will move quietly with van Kleffens [3] down the lines of your letter to Eden with reference to Portuguese Timor [4] and will keep you advised. The appropriate time for entering into a definite arrangement will probably be when the Pacific Conference visualised in your statement in Parliament [5] is held.</p>

<p>I share your view that van Kleffens should personally attend this Conference.</p>

<p>With regard to (2), I have now learnt that the Netherlands Government have formally approved proposals, which I gather have been under discussion for some time, which contemplate van Mook resigning as Minister for the Colonies and proceeding to Australia as Governor-General designate of the Netherlands East Indies, with a view to perfecting the organisation for the Dutch to take over control of their own territories as, and when, they are liberated.</p>

<p>Matter having proceeded so far, it could only be re-opened by a formal reference back to the Dutch Cabinet. I am afraid, therefore, the time has passed when I can do anything on a personal and informal basis with van Kleffens.</p>
