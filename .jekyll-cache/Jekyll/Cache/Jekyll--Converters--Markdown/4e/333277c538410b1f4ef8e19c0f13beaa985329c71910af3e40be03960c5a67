<p>I.L.O.</p>

<p>Preparatory Asian Regional Conference New Delhi 27th October to 10th November</p>

<p>It appears to be highly desirable that (a) Australia should be represented at the above Conference; and (b) the Australian Government representation should include a person either well versed or well briefed in the politico-economic issues of India, South East Asia and China, for the following, among other, reasons:-</p>

<p>(1) Australiaâ€™s presence is particularly requested, as it is in some sense regarded as a model and source of information for the Asiatic countries in relation to labour conditions, labour laws, etc;</p>

<p>(2) the desirability of regional co-operation. This has been emphasised as a fundamental part of the Governmentâ€™s policy;</p>

<p>(3) Solution of Asiatic labour problems by migration is likely to be canvassed, just as it was at the Montreal Conference in 1946, especially by Bajpai [1] (India);</p>

<p>(4) The important effects on Australiaâ€™s economy of greatly increased efforts towards industrialisation in Asia as part of a plan to raise living standards-including a greater demand for Australian capital goods;</p>

<p>(5) Asia will remain ripe for the extension of Soviet influence unless an improvement in labour conditions, labour laws etc. is brought about;</p>

<p>(6) An improvement in labour standards in Asia will depend in part on first raising the standard of health and educational services, and this is a sphere of activity in which Australia can be of increasing assistance. [2]</p>
