<p>Mr H. Read (Australian Wool Realization Commission) advised me this morning that Mr Sparkes, Chief Valuer, Sydney, had informed him on Monday that Japanâ€™s shortage of sterling is rather evident in Eastern markets.</p>

<p>(1) Japan is buying quite limited quantities at the Brisbane sales. Normally, she patronises these late Brisbane sales rather well.</p>

<p>(2) There is a good deal of wool purchased by Japan which is still in store unpaid for.</p>

<p>(3) Some wools have actually been on board ship but removed from the ship before departure because of financing difficulties.</p>

<p>2. It will be recalled that Mr Menzies [1] reported recently that several Australian buying houses were carrying their Japanese clients this season.</p>

<p><em>1 That is, H.C. Menzies.</em></p>
