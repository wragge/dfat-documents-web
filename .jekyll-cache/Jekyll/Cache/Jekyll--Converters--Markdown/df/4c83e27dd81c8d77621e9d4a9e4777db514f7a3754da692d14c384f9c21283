<p>Confidential</p>

<p>When I spoke to you in London about Britainâ€™s negotiations with the Community,<a href="#f1">1</a> you told me that the detailed case which Britain would be putting forward had yet to be formulated. Accordingly, rather than making any detailed proposals on the solutions, I confined myself to stating the problems as we see them. I mentioned that in the ultimate some amelioration of the damage to Australia could come from a longer transition period, but the request for a longer transition period was not part of our case and in any event it did not solve anything.</p>

<p>I told authorities of the EEC that it was not our intention to expect Britain alone to state Australiaâ€™s case and to identify what provisions need to be made in the new arrangements for the enlarged Community. I made it clear to the Commission that, while expecting the United Kingdom to state the Australian problems, we will at the same time continue to press what we conceive to be our minimum rights under GATT principles.</p>

<p>To avoid any discrepancy between the British identification of the problems and the Australian identification of our problems, I would be glad if you would let me know as soon as you are in a position to do so what the United Kingdom proposes to say to the EEC in respect of Australiaâ€™s problems and needs.</p>
