I"é<p>Cablegram 360 CANBERRA, 8 July 1942</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegrams 497 [1] and 498. [2]</p>

<p>1. In view of fact that we received cablegrams from Bowden up to</p>

<p>February 10th, and advice that he stated on the day before the</p>

<p>actual capitulation took place he proposed to remain, we are not</p>

<p>satisfied with the Japanese statement that he left Singapore for</p>

<p>the N.E.I. about the end of January. [3]</p>

<p>However, as there is a doubt about his present whereabouts, and as</p>

<p>Ross is outside Japanese control [4], we are prepared to proceed</p>

<p>with exchange scheme as a whole, on lines and on basis of</p>

<p>priorities originally suggested. [5] As, however, scheme</p>

<p>contemplates further ships at a later stage we would insist that</p>

<p>the Japanese be specially requested to agree to the repatriation</p>

<p>of Bowden and his staff as soon as their whereabouts become known.</p>

<p>2. As Free French have agreed to surrender Japanese from New</p>

<p>Caledonia for whom priority has been requested, we have</p>

<p>reconsidered this question. As military position in relation to</p>

<p>New Caledonia has substantially altered recently with the arrival</p>

<p>there of American forces and in regard to which internees probably</p>

<p>cannot be so well informed, we now withdraw our previous</p>

<p>objection.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 6 July (FA:A3195, 1942, 1.26571). It expressed</p>

<p>concern at the Commonwealth Govtâ€™s proposal to exclude from the</p>

<p>Free French.</p>

<p>4 See Document 2, note 2.</p>

<p>5 Between 27 August and 9 September two Japanese ships arrived at</p>

<p>Lourenco Marques carrying some 1800 U.K. and Dominion nationals</p>

<p>from Japan, Manchuria, Japanese-occupied China, Indo-China and</p>

<p>Thailand, while three British ships arrived with an approximately</p>

<p>similar number of Japanese who had been interned in the British</p>

<p>Empire. Among the Australians repatriated were the staff of the</p>

<p>former Legation in Tokyo and their families.</p>
