<p>There is still no reply from the PRC Ambassador<a href="#f1">1</a> although he had today 13 March his first meeting with the American Ambassador. I am beginning to wonder whether in fact there will ever be a reply other than what may be this indirect negative.</p>

<p>2. Should I keep on seeking an appointment?</p>
