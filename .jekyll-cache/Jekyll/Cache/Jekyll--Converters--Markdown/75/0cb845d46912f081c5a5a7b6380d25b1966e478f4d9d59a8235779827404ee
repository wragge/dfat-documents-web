<p>5 Bruce was informed on 12 October that Air Commodore F. H.</p>

<p>McNamara and Colonel J. H. F. Pain would represent the Air Force and Army respectively. Pain in fact became seriously ill before the talks began and was replaced by Major J. K. Coffey. As there was no suitable Australian naval officer in London Bruce was asked to arrange with the Admiralty for a representative to hold a watching brief over Australian naval interests. The Commonwealth Govt stressed the importance the Australian naval authorities attached to the development of naval bases at Darwin and Port Moresby.
