<p>PERSONAL FOR CASEY MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your conversations with Secretary of State [1] seem to us to be accomplishing one of their objectives of keeping Japanese guessing. I have had two visits from Consul General Japan [2] during last week especially for purpose of endeavouring to ascertain extent and nature of conversations.</p>

<p>He emphasises they are most disturbing and appear directed against Japan. Naturally I have been completely non-committal, and it is obvious his mind is most perturbed.</p>
