<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Dutch Army communique of 17th October announced four separate large-scale mopping up operations. Eaton’s description of situation cabled to you in our No. 629 [1] makes it clear that such operations would amount to full scale warfare. These moves are made in order that the position of Dutch will be stronger when the Committee of Three makes its decisions. It is urgent that there should be a decision on ‘cease fire’ order that is along the lines of ‘stand fast’ interpretation. If necessary, Security Council should instruct Committee not to proceed with negotiations until the order is observed. These operations on such a scale as at present are making a farce out of the original decisions, as casualties are on a greater scale than they were during the original fighting.</p>

<p>2. Please keep us advised, for Kirby’s information, on any action taken by the Security Council.</p>
