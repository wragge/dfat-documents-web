<p>Douglas Anthony, Australiaâ€™s Deputy Premier, said today that in its negotiations to enter the Common Market Britain had failed to keep its promise to Australia.</p>

<p>Britain had apparently â€˜washed its handsâ€™ to [sic] responsibility for Australiaâ€™s social problems, Anthony told newsmen at Heathrow Airport where he was leaving for Washington, DC for two days of talks on USâ€“Australian trade relations.</p>

<p>â€˜We had asked for a transitional period for our butter and sugar, yet nothing is going to be doneâ€™, he said. â€˜We did not come here as a bleating child holding on to a motherâ€™s apron string.â€™</p>

<p>â€˜We can stand up for ourselves, but a promise was given to us and it has not been fulfilled. I am wondering what we can trust in what is said to usâ€™, Anthony said.</p>

<p>He said his 10-day trip to Britain had apparently made no impression on the effects Britainâ€™s entry to the Common Market would have on Australiaâ€™s rural community.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no determination by Britain to push Australiaâ€™s case, he said.</p>

<p>â€˜I cannot see much hope for the Commonwealth if this is to be the approachâ€™, the Deputy Premier added.</p>
