I"N<p>Cablegram 59 WASHINGTON, 28 September 1938</p>

<p>Press have doubtless reported fully that President Roosevelt last night followed up his general appeal of last week by a message to Hitler alone urging continuance of negotiations to end crisis and that use of force would be unjustified and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Position here is that whilst ten days ago there was at least as much criticism of the United Kingdom Government’s action as support for it there is now a very general attitude of praise for Mr Chamberlain’s efforts and an increasing criticism of what is generally described as the reckless attitude of Germany.</p>

<p>But although we now have public opinion and sympathy there is every sign that this country is determined not to become embroiled.</p>
