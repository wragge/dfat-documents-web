<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>Announcement of main Cabinet appointments likely tonight. Small War Cabinet of five probable. The Prime Minister [1] remaining Minister of Defence, Chamberlain Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons. Halifax remains at the Foreign Office. Eden leaving the Dominions Office and I fear may become Secretary of State for Air: I trust not as he is not strong enough and has not the necessary drive.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Winston S. Churchill.</p>
