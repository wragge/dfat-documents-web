I" <p>Cablegram 58 WASHINGTON, 26 September 1938</p>

<p>Following for Hodgson personally and very confidentially.</p>

<p>I have had a talk this morning with Canadian officials who had no news but who were very worried about position their country will be in if worst happens. They fear that once pressure from what they term ardent British will increase determination French not to become involved and that there is likely to be unpleasant and acrimonious debate when Parliament meets. They inquired probable Australian attitude. I said that I had no information beyond press reports of Prime Ministerâ€™s [1] remarks which seemed to indicate full support of United Kingdom. They asked re New Zealand and I expressed view that their attitude at Geneva seemed to make their support of United Kingdom quite certain.</p>
