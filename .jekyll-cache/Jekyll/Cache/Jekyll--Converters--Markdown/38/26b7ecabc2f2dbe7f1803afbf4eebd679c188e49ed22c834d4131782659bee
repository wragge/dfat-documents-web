I"Ü<p>Cablegram 520 LONDON, 6 July 1940, 2.52 a.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL MOST SECRET</p>

<p>JAPAN. Chiefs of Staff appreciation strongly stressing</p>

<p>impossibility of facing war with Japan was before the War Cabinet</p>

<p>when reply further considered this afternoon. Discussion</p>

<p>apparently inconclusive but understood that majority view</p>

<p>necessary to give way on Burma road. As I believe a positive</p>

<p>policy such as I have always advocated is best course, I made a</p>

<p>last attempt even at this eleventh hour by putting in a memorandum</p>

<p>which I made clear expressed solely my personal views down the</p>

<p>following lines:</p>

<p>(i) If we do not give way there is danger of war.</p>

<p>(2) If we do give way probably not the end of Japanese demands.</p>

<p>(3) Give Craigie [1] instructions to put the position with</p>

<p>absolute frankness down the following lines:</p>

<p>(a) We desire good relations and broad settlement.</p>

<p>(b) Cannot merely agree to Japanese demands because of the</p>

<p>reactions of our own people to acquiescence in dictation and the</p>

<p>effect on the United States.</p>

<p>While anxious for good relations with Japan we cannot purchase</p>

<p>them at the price of losing American goodwill which is vital to us</p>

<p>in our desperate struggle in Europe.</p>

<p>(c) If we did agree by no means certain would lead to the</p>

<p>accomplishment of Japanâ€™s major objective, i.e., liquidation of</p>

<p>China position.</p>

<p>(d) If we do not agree and war resulted Japanese position</p>

<p>difficult because-</p>

<p>(a) though heavily engaged elsewhere the British Empire could</p>

<p>still be troublesome.</p>

<p>(b) Danger of United States declaring war. While United States</p>

<p>[public] [2] opinion bitter[ly opposed] to war in Europe large</p>

<p>section regard Japan as danger in the Pacific Ocean and at any</p>

<p>moment might swing in favour of hostilities.</p>

<p>(c) Damage financial and economic embargo of [sic] United States</p>

<p>and British Empire would inflict.</p>

<p>(d) If we defeat Germany we would be strong enough to enforce</p>

<p>retribution for any blackmail imposed on us now.</p>

<p>(e) If Germany defeated us and the Far Eastern position had not</p>

<p>been stabilized Germany would certainly come into the Pacific</p>

<p>Ocean.</p>

<p>(4) Having put reasons why trouble now would not suit Japan or us</p>

<p>Craigie should be authorized to suggest a broad settlement down</p>

<p>the following lines:</p>

<p>(1) United Kingdom prepared to use best endeavours to bring about</p>

<p>a settlement in China provided that Japan prepared to agree to</p>

<p>reasonable terms which safeguarded Chinaâ€™s independence.</p>

<p>(2) If Japan prepared to agree to such terms and a settlement with</p>

<p>China can be effected the United Kingdom Prepared-</p>

<p>(a) To afford financial assistance by way of loan up to an agreed</p>

<p>amount on favourable terms if requested to do so.</p>

<p>(b) To co-operate in the rehabilitation and development of China</p>

<p>and to agree to preferential opportunity for Japan in respect to</p>

<p>supply of consumption goods to China.</p>

<p>(c) To endeavour to obtain co-operation of the United States in</p>

<p>respect to (a) and (b).</p>

<p>(d) To discuss with Japan the stabilization of territorial</p>

<p>position in the Far East and to endeavour to obtain the co-</p>

<p>operation of the United States, the Netherlands and France in a</p>

<p>settlement.</p>

<p>(e) To assist in ensuring to Japan vital necessities in raw</p>

<p>materials.</p>

<p>(f) To agree to the open door in non-selfgoverning territories and</p>

<p>to discuss with Governments concerned increased opportunities for</p>

<p>Japan in self-governing parts of the Empire.</p>

<p>(d) might involve handing over some islands to Japan and (f) the</p>

<p>giving up of advantages British manufacturers have enjoyed in the</p>

<p>colonial Empire. If the war is lost these are immaterial. If war</p>

<p>is won the world will be constituted on so changed a basis that</p>

<p>the former will probably be immaterial and the latter is almost</p>

<p>certain to be the agreed settlement of the colonial problem.</p>

<p>Repeated to Washington No. 32.</p>
