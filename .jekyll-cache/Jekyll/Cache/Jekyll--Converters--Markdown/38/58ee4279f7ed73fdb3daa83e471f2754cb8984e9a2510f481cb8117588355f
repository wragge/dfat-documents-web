I"ó	<p>Cablegram 121[A] LONDON, 2 August 1942, 7.50 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>My telegram S.34 of 4th June. [1] There have been developments</p>

<p>during the past week of which it is desirable that I should inform</p>

<p>you. After the Cabinet Meeting on Monday last, I had a short</p>

<p>preliminary conversation with the Prime Minister with regard to</p>

<p>our representation here. It is unnecessary to indicate the tenor</p>

<p>of that conversation as subsequent developments make it clear.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I wrote to the Prime Minister the following letter:-</p>

<p>â€˜After our meeting last night, I dictated a short note to try and</p>

<p>clear my mind. Although in our conversation I said to you I did</p>

<p>not think anything in writing would be helpful, on reading the</p>

<p>note I am inclined to think it might be useful as a basis for</p>

<p>discussion when we meet again. I accordingly enclose it herewith.â€™</p>

<p>The note referred to is contained in my immediately following</p>

<p>telegram, No. 122[A]. [2]</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a long talk with Attlee who told me that the Prime</p>

<p>Minister had shown him my note and asked him to discuss it with</p>

<p>me.</p>

<p>As a result of that conversation I have today written to Attlee</p>

<p>the</p>

<p>following letter [3]:-</p>

<p>â€˜With reference my note to the Prime Minister of 27th July and my</p>

<p>conversation with you yesterday, the position as I understand it</p>

<p>is that, without any precise formula being laid down, we will</p>

<p>endeavour in the light of the frank exchange of views that has</p>

<p>taken place to work out in practice a mutually satisfactory</p>

<p>arrangement. I realize your difficulties and you can rest assured</p>

<p>that whatever I can do, consistent with my obligations to my</p>

<p>Government, to help you to overcome them, I will willingly do.â€™</p>

<p>I am hopeful that it will be possible to work out the â€˜mutually</p>

<p>satisfactory arrangementâ€™ referred to in my letter to Attlee and</p>

<p>subject to any instruction from you I propose to go ahead on this</p>

<p>line.</p>
