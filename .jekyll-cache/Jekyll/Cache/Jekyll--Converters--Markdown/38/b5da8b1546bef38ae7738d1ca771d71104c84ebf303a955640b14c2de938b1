<p>4627. RESTRICTED</p>

<p>The Consultative Committee today approved the August report of the Standing Committee on Technical Assistance which provides a constitution for an organisation which will be responsible for the provision of technical assistance under the Commonwealth scheme.</p>

<p>2. The proposals contained in the report and the constitution are in accordance with the instructions sent to the Australian Representative on the Standing Committee after interdepartmental consultation.</p>

<p>3. Since the report and constitution involve no new obligations beyond those accepted by Cabinet following Sydney Conference in May, I propose to accept the report on behalf of the Government.</p>

<p>4. By separate telegram I will comment on matters upon which you asked my views in your 414 to New York.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>
