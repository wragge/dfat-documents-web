I"™<p>Cablegram 1701 17 December 1940,</p>

<p>PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET</p>

<p>It seems to me desirable that I should accept outstanding invitation to visit London to discuss matters of mutual war importance. Commonwealth Parliament has gone into recess until March and I could leave towards middle of January. Could you confirm that this agreeable to United Kingdom Government. Would of course cable list of matters to be discussed.</p>

<p>I would like to fly to Egypt to make contact with Australian forces there and go thence to Great Britain by the quickest route.</p>

<p>Would be glad of advice as to what arrangements could be made for quick transit Egypt to Great Britain for self and party of say three others.</p>

<p>It would give satisfaction in Australia if a personal consultation of this kind could conveniently take place.</p>
