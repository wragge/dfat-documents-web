<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Mission from Indo-China has been here lately endeavouring to get aircraft 80 fighters 32 bombers and 10 training aircraft. United States has none available at Philippines. Berle [1] asked me today if I thought Australia would be able to supply even 15 or 20. I said general election would inevitably delay consideration of matters of such high political consequence and that I believed Australian Government would hesitate to take such action which Japanese might well consider bellicose.</p>

<p>However Berle asked if I would inquire and said even old planes of either British or American types would do, and that the United States would replace them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I reminded him of shortage of aircraft in Australia and that in any case Australian pilots could not deliver for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Berle believes moral and material help that even relatively small number of aircraft [could give] might tip the balance and result in French in Indo-China offering resistance to Japanese.</p>

<p>However, my own impression of situation is that Vichy has in fact capitulated in face of Japanese demands and that it is too late to try to organize resistance.</p>

<p>For reasons you will appreciate I thought it best not to turn down at once this suggestion for co-operation but glad if you send me reasoned reply which I can pass on to him. [2]</p>

<p>CASEY</p>

<p>2 The External Affairs Dept replied on 27 September: ‘Can be definitely said that no service types or service training types of aircraft can be made available from Australian resources for allotment to Indo-China at present or in near future.’ See cablegram 186 on file AA:A981, Indo-China 4.</p>
