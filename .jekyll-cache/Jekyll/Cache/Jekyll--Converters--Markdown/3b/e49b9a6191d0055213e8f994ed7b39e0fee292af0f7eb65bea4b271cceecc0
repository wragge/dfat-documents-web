<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Subandrio, Indonesia representative here, called 24th December and stated that he was trying to communicate with his Administration through Indian Government so far unsuccessfully. He said a United Kingdom Consul was probably going to Djockjakarta to observe and if necessary seek improvement of welfare of political detainees.</p>

<p>He hoped we might also send someone from Batavia. He alleges that Spoor has a plan for liquidation of Indonesian political leaders and intellectuals.</p>
