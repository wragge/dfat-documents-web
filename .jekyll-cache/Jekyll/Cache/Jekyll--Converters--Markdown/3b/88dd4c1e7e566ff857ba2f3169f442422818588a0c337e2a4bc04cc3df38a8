<p>Thank you for your pleasant message which I have welcomed. My colleagues and I very much appreciated your frank and informative contribution to our Cabinet Room discussion. <a href="#f1">1</a> It is good to know you took away a good impression of Australian development and optimism for our future which we share. You found here a predominantly British community proud of its history and heritage. A visit such as yours serves to keep our relations close and warm. I look forward to seeing you again whether in London or back here in Australia. Sincerely reciprocating your regards.</p>
