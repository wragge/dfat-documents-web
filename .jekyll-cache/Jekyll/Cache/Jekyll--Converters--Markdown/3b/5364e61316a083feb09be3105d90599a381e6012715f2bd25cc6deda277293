I"T<p>Cablegram 224 CANBERRA, 18 September 1943</p>

<p>Please deliver following personal message from Minister to Eden alone.</p>

<p>Begins.</p>

<p>I would refer you to D.650 and D.651 [1] and our reply No. 244 of 16th September. [2] You are well aware of my views on the topic of the Dominions, and I feel that unless the present practice is closely watched a great deal of serious misunderstanding will be created. Step by step the Dominions are being excluded and I foresee trouble unless a halt is called to present tendency.</p>

<p>In some respects the position is not as satisfactory as it was when Lloyd George was Prime Minister. This is a personal message for you but I have already expressed similar views at British Cabinet.</p>

<p>I would like you to discuss question particularly with Amery and Kingsley Wood who will I am confident prefer to regard the proper unit and party the British Commonwealth rather than United Kingdom only.</p>

<p>Best wishes. Ends.</p>
