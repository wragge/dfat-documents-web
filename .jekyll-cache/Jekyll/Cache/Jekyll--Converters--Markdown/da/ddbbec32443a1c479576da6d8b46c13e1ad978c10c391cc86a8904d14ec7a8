<p>When making proposals for an exchange of representatives in my telegram of 22nd November [1] I should have mentioned that whilst we should like to be able to announce in the near future that our two Governments have agreed to an exchange of representatives, we, for our part, should be very glad to take the first step without immediate reciprocity. We fully appreciate the difficulties you no doubt have in finding personnel for your rapidly extending representatives abroad and we should be very willing to wait for the Australian representative here until any such later date as would enable you and Dr. Evatt to take the necessary steps on your side.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to wish you and your colleagues in the Australian Government a very happy New Year.</p>
