<p>MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>As the time would not permit your receiving and replying to my telegram 205 [1] before meeting Supreme War Council tomorrow I have this afternoon seen the Prime Minister [2] and put the various points raised in it to him. I also put to him the views set out in my telegram 190. [3] I made it quite clear that all the views expressed were my own and that I had not been authorized by you to raise any of the points. His reaction was very strong that I was doing less than justice to the United Kingdom Government. We had a long conversation covering the points raised in my telegram in particular the Finnish episode and importance of south-east European position in particular Turkey. The Prime Ministerâ€™s attitude was that everything possible had been done with regard to Finland and that the Government was alive to the position in regard to south-east Europe and Turkey and everything possible was being done. I maintained that there were lessons to be learnt from the Finnish episode and continued to press the possibilities of more energetic action in regard to south-east Europe. While the Prime Minister was in no way weakened in his defence of Governmentâ€™s past and present actions I think some of points I stressed will stick and that the conversation was useful.</p>

<p>At the commencement of conversation Prime Minister was clearly resentful of criticism implied in views I expressed but happily this disappeared in the discussion and interview ended in a most friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p>His obvious preoccupation was lest I had created in your mind an unfavourable impression of the United Kingdom Governmentâ€™s conduct of the war.</p>

<p>I accordingly at the end of the interview again stressed that what I had been saying represented my own views, had been put forward solely in the hope of helping him and that he could reply completely on the co-operation and support of Australia.</p>

<p>I therefore suggest that you take no further action.</p>
