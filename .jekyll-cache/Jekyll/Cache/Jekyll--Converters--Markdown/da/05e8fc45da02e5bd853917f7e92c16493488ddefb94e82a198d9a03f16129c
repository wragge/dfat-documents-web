I"¸<p>Letter BATAVIA, 29 April 1938</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th April [1], in which you were good enough to inform me that His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has decided against the establishment of an air connection with Dilli.</p>

<p>2. In regard to your request for information as to further developments in this matter, I have the honour to inform you that the Manager of K.N.I.L.M. informed me in conversation a week or two ago that the Government of Portuguese Timor has lately been showing interest in the possibility of the establishment of air connection with the Netherlands East Indies by a service of K.N.I.L.M. and the matter was now receiving consideration. I said that this sounded very satisfactory, and that I hoped such a line might materialise.</p>
