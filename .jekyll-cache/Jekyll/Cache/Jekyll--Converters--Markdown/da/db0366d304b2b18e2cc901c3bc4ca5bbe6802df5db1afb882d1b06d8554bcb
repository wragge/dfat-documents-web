<p>8. Monetary policy, note issue, customs, foreign exchange regulations, trade policy will be unified for the Territory of the R.I.S.</p>

<p>9. As long as there exist financial obligations of Indonesia towards the Netherlands, and as long as there are guarantees given by the Netherlands for debts of the R.I.S., the monetary system and the system of the bank of issue of the R.I.S. will be arranged by agreement between the parties. The Netherlands will be represented in the board which will determine the foreign exchange policy of the R.I.S.</p>
