<p>2 Evatt informed the Japanese Minister to Australia, Tatsuo Kawai, of the contents of this cablegram in a letter dispatched the same day (on file AA: A981, War 69, ii). The Japanese Foreign Minister, Shigenori Togo, had already advised Officer on 8 December that a state of war existed between Japan and Australia as from that day.</p>

See the Canberra copy of no. 531 (on file AA: A981, War 53A) and the Tokyo legation copy (subsequently brought back to Australia by Officer) On file AA: A981, Japan 181, iv.</p>
