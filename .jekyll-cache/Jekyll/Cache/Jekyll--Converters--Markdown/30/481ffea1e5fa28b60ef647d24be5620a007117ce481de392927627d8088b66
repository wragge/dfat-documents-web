<p>United Kingdom view informally obtained pending written reply anticipated next week is in entire agreement with proposed Australian occupation of Heard Island. United Kingdom relinquishes all claims thereon which it may have and which Law Officers state are extremely tenuous. Suggest that if public statement be made the word ‘occupation’ not ‘annexation’ be used avoiding public suggestion of sovereignty claims at this stage. Machinery proposed for relinquishment of claim is still under discussion between legal officers of Foreign Office and Colonial Office.</p>

<p>1 Requesting early advice on annexation, as the party would leave for Heard Island on 14 November.</p>
