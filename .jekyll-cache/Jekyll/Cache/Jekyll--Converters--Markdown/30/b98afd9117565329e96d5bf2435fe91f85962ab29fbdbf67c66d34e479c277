I"õ<p>Cablegram 83 12 March 1941,</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 122. [1] Your advice regarding position of Japanese shipping companies in relation to ship warrants scheme is noted with interest. The scheme as originally applied to Japanese ships amended as regards bunker supplies to comply with the United Kingdom Governmentâ€™s latest request and with minor modifications in other respects to meet local conditions is still in operation in Australia. No relaxation is contemplated. Beyond the Consul- Generalâ€™s [2] statement no advice has been received that the Japanese Government guarantees non-enemy destination of all exports from Australia. Last year such a guarantee was given through the Consul-General to Commonwealth wool committee in respect of wool. We are requiring undertakings of non-enemy destination from individual consignees in Japan for exports of goods of strategical importance.</p>
