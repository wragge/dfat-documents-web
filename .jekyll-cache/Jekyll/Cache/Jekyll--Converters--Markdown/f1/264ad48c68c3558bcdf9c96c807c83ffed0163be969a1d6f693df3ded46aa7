<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>With reference to Dominions Office cablegram No. 532 [1], the</p>

<p>Government is appreciative of your own personal acknowledgement in</p>

<p>Part 2 of the difficulties which confront it in this matter.</p>

<p>2. It is frankly disappointed that the review of the Chiefs of</p>

<p>Staff dwells at some length on the strategical position in the</p>

<p>Middle East but does not even mention the position in the Pacific.</p>

<p>We know that we can count on an understanding by you of how</p>

<p>vitally important the Pacific must loom before the Australian</p>

<p>Government in reaching a decision on the disposition of its</p>

<p>limited forces.</p>

<p>3. It can be asserted that since the outbreak of war we have never</p>

<p>received from the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff an appreciation</p>

<p>that has indicated a full realisation of the possibilities of the</p>

<p>situation in the Pacific, either in respect of offensive action by</p>

<p>Japan or offensive action by the United Nations to defeat Japan.</p>

<p>4. Australia has been critically threatened on two occasions-</p>

<p>firstly following the fall of the Malay Barrier, and secondly</p>

<p>following the threatened advance through the Coral Sea. Japan is</p>

<p>now consolidating her position in New Guinea and the Solomon</p>

<p>Islands and has made a landing in Papua which threatens our</p>

<p>important advanced base at Port Moresby, which is vital to the</p>

<p>defence of the north-eastern coast against enemy landings and the</p>

<p>maintenance of the passage through Torres Strait for the supply of</p>

<p>Darwin.</p>

<p>5. It is imperative to force the enemy back to his bases in the</p>

<p>Mandated Islands in the north-east and to drive him out of Timor</p>

<p>in the north-west. The Government desires that the Commander-in-</p>

<p>Chief, South-West Pacific Area, shall have at his disposal for the</p>

<p>defence of his base and for offensive operations in the Pacific</p>

<p>all the Australian Forces it can place at his disposal.</p>

<p>Furthermore, superior seapower and airpower are vital to wrest the</p>

<p>initiative from Japan and are essential to assure the defensive</p>

<p>position in the South-West Pacific Area.</p>

<p>6. For the reasons stated, it is impossible for us to do more than</p>

<p>agree to an extension of the period for the temporary retention of</p>

<p>the 9th Division in the Middle East. As the Commander-in-Chief of</p>

<p>the Australian Military Forces strongly advises against the</p>

<p>breaking up of ancillary units for reinforcements because of the</p>

<p>effect on morale, approval has been given for the despatch of two</p>

<p>months’ reinforcements on the average scale of activity, the total</p>

<p>number being 1,989. These, with the 3,203 reinforcements recently</p>

<p>available in the Middle East, will provide a total of 5,192 for 2</p>

<p>1/2 months’ reinforcements on the intense scale of activity. The</p>

<p>Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East will therefore need to have</p>

<p>these facts in mind in his use of the Division.</p>

<p>7. The Commander-in-Chief, South-West Pacific Area, has had</p>

<p>assigned to him all the combat naval, land and air forces of the</p>

<p>Commonwealth, but we are gravely concerned about developing the</p>

<p>air strength for which we are capable of providing the personnel</p>

<p>and which our own advisers and the Commander-in-Chief, South-West</p>

<p>Pacific Area, consider the minimum for the defence of Australia.</p>

<p>This arises from the inability to obtain a definite assurance on</p>

<p>the supply of equipment. The Government’s willing agreement to the</p>

<p>temporary retention of the 9th Division in the Middle East is</p>

<p>therefore conditional on an assurance being given by the United</p>

<p>Kingdom Government that, in conformity with Ismay’s letter to</p>

<p>Evatt [2], its representatives in Washington will be instructed to</p>

<p>do their utmost to ensure the allotment of the aircraft required</p>

<p>for the re-equipment of the R.A.A.F. and the provision, as</p>

<p>personnel is trained and squadrons are organised, of the equipment</p>

<p>required for the programme of a total of 73 squadrons by June,</p>

<p>1943. The case for equipment is supported by the fact that 7,800</p>

<p>trained personnel have been sent overseas under the Empire Air</p>

<p>Training Scheme. It is also desired to raise the question of the</p>

<p>regular allotment to the South-West Pacific Area of Australian</p>

<p>squadrons with operational experience.</p>
