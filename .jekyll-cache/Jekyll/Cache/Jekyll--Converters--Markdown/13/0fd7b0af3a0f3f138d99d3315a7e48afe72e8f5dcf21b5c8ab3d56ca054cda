<p>PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>(Due to arrive Canberra 8.6.29)</p>

<p>My dear P.M.,</p>

<p>In an earlier letter I mentioned the advertisement by Corporation &amp; General Securities Ltd. [1], urging the public to â€˜invest Britishâ€™. This was one of a series of such advertisements prior to the issue of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works loan. I put in hand some enquiries about Corporation &amp; General Securities Ltd., and enclose herewith copy of a letter from a friend in the City.</p>

<p>I also enclose â€˜Timesâ€™ report of Corporation &amp; General Securities Ltd.â€™s recent General Meeting and other notices. It may interest you to know privately that their advertisements were written by Grondona. [2]</p>

<p>I am, Yours sincerely, R.G. CASEY</p>

<p>_1 Letter 193.</p>

<p>2 Leo St Clare Grondona, Australian-born publicist.</p>
