<h2 id="message-to-the-president-from-prime-minister">Message to the President from Prime Minister</h2>

<p>The following is the text of the message referred to in our immediately preceding telegram:<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<h3 id="begins">Begins</h3>

<p>Your Excellency,<br />
I have asked my Ambassador, Mr Woolcott, to see you personally to give you background information about my talks with the Chinese leaders. I have in mind that he particularly discuss with you press reports which could give a misleading impression of the substance of our discussions.</p>

<p>I am particularly upset about press reports which imply that comments had been made reflecting on Indonesia and your own distinguished leadership. You should know that during my discussions I was very conscious of the need to keep Indonesian interests in mind, and the Ambassador will be able to make this clear to you. I want you to know that I hold the relationship between Indonesia and Australia in the first importance and I attach great significance to the development of a close relationship between us personally.</p>

<p>With this in mind I feel it important to have a personal meeting with you as we had agreed in our previous exchanges.<a href="#f2">2</a> I should like to visit Indonesia at a time that is convenient to you, but the dates I have tentatively set aside are 10 to 12 October. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether these dates would be convenient to you, or any alternative dates you may have in mind around this period.</p>

<p>Malcolm Fraser</p>

  <li>1 In Cablegram CH375151 (30 June) Renoufinformed Woolcott that the Prime Minister wished him â€˜to see President Soeharto at the earliest possible moment and pass on to the President himself the contents of the message Dan has already delivered lower down the lineâ€™. He asked Woolcott to emphasise to Soeharto the importance which Fraser attributed to relations between Indonesia and Australia as well as â€˜the importance to both countries of the avoidance of Great Power conflict or interference in South East Asiaâ€™. Woolcott was also asked to â€˜assure the President of the high regard Mr Fraser has for him, for Mr Fraserâ€™s appreciation of what the President has done in Indonesia and Mr Fraserâ€™s feeling that very much in Indonesia depends upon the continuation of the Presidentâ€™s leadership of his countryâ€™. It concluded by advising Woolcott that the immediately following cablegram contained the text of a message which Fraser wished the Australian Ambassador to pass to Soeharto.</li>
