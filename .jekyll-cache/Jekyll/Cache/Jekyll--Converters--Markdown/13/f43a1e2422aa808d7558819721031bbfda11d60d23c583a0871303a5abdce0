<p><strong>Off to Marketâ€”1962</strong></p>

<p>This journey to London promises to be one of the most exciting, stimulating and interesting of the series. The Common Market talks will dominate the Prime Ministersâ€™ Conference, and in a very real sense we shall be standing at a cross road of history. Here truly is a â€˜Grand Design.â€™ Few issues can have been of more consequence, to the British race and to the future shape of the world. Not a simple clear-cut issue this, but one with many fascinating facets requiring much solid work over years and clear thinking looking beyond the narrow national interest. That national interest is, itself, full of prickly consequences for the participants and wrong judgment or failures of accomplishment could wreck any of the Governments concerned. What luck to be at hand as the drama unfolds. [â€¦]</p>
