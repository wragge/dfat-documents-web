I"ö<p>Cablegram unnumbered 5 July 1940,</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>On further reading proposed reply to Japan [1] and latest news</p>

<p>regarding increased power of militant party in Japan we are</p>

<p>impressed by view that if Great Britain not in fact sending</p>

<p>materials of war along Burmese Road there should be no difficulty</p>

<p>about undertaking [? not] to do so. Press cables to Australia</p>

<p>suggesting that Great Britain insisting upon the right to supply</p>

<p>war material to China are doing harm to public opinion which feels</p>

<p>that such materials are badly needed by British countries. Suggest</p>

<p>therefore that agreement regarding prevention of passage of such</p>

<p>material can properly be made. This applies Hong Kong Frontier as</p>

<p>well as Burma. [2]</p>
