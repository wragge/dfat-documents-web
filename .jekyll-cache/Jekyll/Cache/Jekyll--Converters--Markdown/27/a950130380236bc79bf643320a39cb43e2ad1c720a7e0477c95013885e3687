<p>Matter has been taken up officially with United States authorities through the military mission.</p>

<p>2. Conversation already held indicate that United States reply will probably be on the following lines:</p>

<p>(a) Extent of support cannot actually be forecast, but will have to be decided according to the situation obtaining at the time.</p>

<p>(b) Possibility is envisaged of a United States squadron operating in the Tasman Sea or around the islands to the northward in case the scale of Japanese attack and/or commitments elsewhere of allied naval forces made such a step advisable.</p>

<p>(c) Possible assistance to Allied naval forces in the protection of trade proceeding eastwards from Australia and New Zealand with special reference to convoys.</p>

[4] Navy Department has raised the pertinent question-with whom should the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet communicate with regard to co- operation with Allied naval forces. As a case in point with whom should he make arrangements for trade protection in the area under discussion: with Chief of the Naval Staff Australia, Chief of the Naval Staff New Zealand, or Commander-in-Chief, China.</p>
