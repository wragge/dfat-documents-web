<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>Have received following from the authorities here:</p>

<p>â€˜It is understood on reliable authority that Chinese Consul- General at Sydney [1] has reported to his Government that he discussed with the Commonwealth Prime Minister the question of Australian diplomatic representation at Chungking. The Consul- Generalâ€™s account is that Mr. Menzies told him of reference to London and answer received, substance of which was that, after reviewing reasons for both acceptance and refusal, which disclose an irreconcilable difference of opinion, Australia was requested to decide the question for herself. Owing to a difference of opinion in Commonwealth Cabinet no decision was reached, but the matter is being further considered by Cabinet, and Mr. Menzies is said to have stated that he would himself vigorously support the proposal. Mr. Menzies is said to have added that there had been some slight difference in the situation since Japanese arrests of United Kingdom nationals and that there might be a good chance for proposal of representation in China being adopted.â€™</p>
