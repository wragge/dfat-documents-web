I"¤<p>6th January, 1927</p>

<p>PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>My dear Prime Minister,</p>

<p>I think you will be interested to see a cutting from the â€˜Economistâ€™ which refers to your visit here and to your speeches in America in the nicest way. [1] From such a source, the tribute (although of course qualified) is somewhat remarkable and you must have created a deep impression upon the editor (W. T. Layton) at Cadburyâ€™s [2] lunch to the Liberal journalists.</p>

<p>I am also enclosing a cutting from the Manchester Guardian on the first poster displayed by the Empire Marketing Board [3] As you know I am one of the two members who run the poster Sub-Committee of the Board and it is very pleasant to receive this tribute from such a paper as the Guardian. I have had copies of this huge poster sent to the Department of Markets and I hope it will be displayed in the Australian capital cities.</p>

<p>I am enclosing four copies of a pull of a recent Empire Marketing Board press advertisement. It is I think original both in design and in copy. Perhaps you may care to have a copy sent to some of your Ministerial colleagues. I have sent one to Mr. Paterson. [4]</p>

<p>I enclose a verbatim copy of your Agricultural speech. It reads very well. Iâ€™ve sent another copy to Mr. Paterson.</p>

<p>I have been very busy with Gepp [5] on a number of matters connected with development.</p>

<p>I am forwarding a copy of the first number of Haden Guestâ€™s [6] paper. I have left the Board of this journal but I think it deserves help. Could you possibly suggest to some influential person that it should be taken by Australian Clubs and get him actively to help it towards a circulation in Australia.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL</p>

<p>_1 An editorial note on 1 January praised Bruceâ€™s contribution to the Imperial Conference and contrasted his â€˜growing consciousness of world problems and a sense of balance and proportionâ€™ with the â€˜narrow and fallacious fiscal obsessionsâ€™ he demonstrated at the 1923 Conference.</p>

<p>3 On 1 January the paper described Highways of Empire, the map painted by a leading poster artist, Macdonald Gill, as â€˜a jolly thing, packed with entertaining detail â€¦ Imperialism without tearsâ€™. It showed â€˜England blushing a patriotic scarlet and ridiculously small as the heart of the world, which is exactly what is wantedâ€™ and â€˜Across the bright blue seas-the highways of Empire-the British ships swarm and cluster round the great ports like bees on the threshold of the hiveâ€™. The map measured 20 feet by 10 feet and was one of the largest colour posters to have been issued. A hoarding large enough to take it was not available in Manchester.</p>
