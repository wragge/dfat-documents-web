<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Received 25 November 1943</p>

<p>The Canadian Minister [1] has shown me copy of a telegram from Ottawa, the contents of which have been on the basis communicated to you [2], indicating that the Canadian Government is now considering signature of a treaty on the lines of the British Treaty and including the right to travel, reside and carry on commerce.</p>

<p>I am seriously concerned at the possibility that Canada may sign this treaty and leave Australia as the only country with diplomatic relations with China which has not formally abolished extraterritoriality.</p>

<p>Although we have a logical reply to this in our offer of either a treaty or an exchange of notes, this would not prevent the Chinese bringing strong public pressure to bear on us to sign the treaty on British lines. I consider Chinese failure to reply to our last proposal [3] is because they hope Canadians will accept the treaty on British lines leaving only Australia outstanding. Such a contingency should be avoided at all costs and I strongly urge that if you are still unprepared to sign the treaty including Articles 6, 7 and 8, of the British Treaty [4] you should make representations to the Canadian Government to delay their signature.</p>
