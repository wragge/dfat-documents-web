<p>It is safe to assume that, as with other Communist regimes in the Soviet orbit, goodwill cannot be bought by mere concessions. It seems at present unlikely that official recognition or admission to the United Nations would change the fundamental character of the regime or at least in the short term, would induce the Peopleâ€™s Government to alter its course.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>1 The first meeting of the Australiaâ€“New Zealandâ€“United States Pacific Security Council took place from 4â€”6 August 1952. The Council was formed as a result of the signing on 1 September 1951 of the ANZUS treaty, whereby Australia, New Zealand and the United States agreed to consult and act in response to threats in the Pacific to the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties. Document 34 was written by Australian authorities for tabling at the first meeting.</p>

<p>2 Discussion at the meeting was dominated by military issues, although Acheson stated that any political settlement following a ceaseâ€“fire in Korea would be â€˜very difficultâ€™ and that the United States â€˜was determined that the Chinese must not be allowed to secure any concessions outside Koreaâ€™.</p>
