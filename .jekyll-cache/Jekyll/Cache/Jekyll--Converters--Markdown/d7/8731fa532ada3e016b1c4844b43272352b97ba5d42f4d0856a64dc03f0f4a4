<p>Secret</p>

<p><strong>Visit to Papua and New Guinea by Indonesian Ambassador</strong></p>

<p>The Administrator has reported on the visit to Papua and New Guinea by the Ambassador for Indonesia, Major-General Kosasih, <a href="#f1">1</a> accompanied by his Military Attache, Colonel Sudiono,<a href="#f2">2</a> and Third Secretary, Mr. Mozes Weror. The main points in the Administrator’s report are—</p>

<p>(i) There was an orderly demonstration at the airport on April 13th by approximately 50 West Irianese, numbers of whom carried banners protesting about the Indonesian depredations and mal-administration in West Irian;<a href="#f3">3</a></p>

<p>(ii) The interest expressed in economic development in Papua and New Guinea;</p>

<p>(iii) The expressed ignorance of the Ambassador about border crossings;</p>

<p>(iv) The Ambassador’s evasiveness on most questions in press conference;</p>

<p>(v) Admission by Ambassador of major economic difficulties in West Irian and its poor rate of development in comparison with Papua and New Guinea;</p>

<p>(vi) His emphasis on ‘act of determination’ rather than ‘plebiscite’ in relation to West Irian’s future;</p>

<p>(vii) Lack of incidents in other centres of Territory;</p>

<p>(viii) Determination of Mr. Weror to play down his alignment with Indonesians and associate himself with his own people’s aspirations;</p>

<p>(ix) Clandestine meetings of Mr. Weror with West Irianese at the home of Benedictus Sarwom where West Irian current affairs were discussed;</p>

<p>(x) The noticeable silence of Weror in the presence of the Ambassador and the Military Attache;</p>

<p>(xi) Weror’s advice to West Irianese in Port Moresby to obey the law and avoid political demonstrations;</p>

<p>(xii) The Ambassador’s open sponsorship of liaison and co-operation between Australia and Indonesia in New Guinea including liaison between West Irian and Papua and New Guinea;</p>

<p>(xiii) The Ambassador’s declining to be drawn out on political questions; and</p>

<p>(viv) The favourable social acceptance by all members of the party throughout their visit.</p>

<p>2. The Administrator has subsequently commented that, in his personal discussions with him, Major-General Kosasih several times stressed the desirability of Australia assisting the Indonesian officials who were engaged in the development of West Irian. He was clearly impressed by what he saw being done in Papua and New Guinea and aware of the enormous task facing the Indonesian officials in West Irian with the limited resources available to them. He mentioned several times the desirability of the best use being made of the $U.S. 31 million being provided by the Dutch through the United Nations.</p>

<p>3. The Administrator has further commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I am not sure whether his references to the exchange of liaison officers were to a separate proposal or just an extension of and cover for training of Indonesian officials. Bearing in mind that the atmosphere in the Territory in relation to West Irian is very unfavourable towards Indonesia, {I} should not be asked to receive too many Indonesian officials in the Territory for instruction and training. Indeed it might be preferable from our point of view if the necessary briefings were given in Australia. I have stronger reservations about exchange of liaison officers.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. The Administrator’s views are consistent with your recent approval that there should be no extension of visits by West Irianese or Indonesians to Papua and New Guinea until the Indonesians give clear evidence of their readiness to allow reciprocal visits.</p>

<p>3 In conversation with Jockel on 30 May, Kosasih said that he had ‘not been concerned’ by the demonstration and had made no public comment on it, even though there had been ‘suggestions that he do so’; he had ‘not even reported the matter to Djakarta’ (NAA: A 1838,303611411/6, Part 6).</p>
