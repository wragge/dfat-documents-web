<p>SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your 73.[1]</p>

<p>I agree with you that we should take all steps necessary to ensure that we are fully informed on E.R.P. and related questions. I would have preferred the establishment of informal liaison arrangements between officials to obtain the more detailed information referred to in paragraph 3 of the Commonwealth Relations Office Telegram No. H.115.[2]</p>

<p>However, in the light of your telegram I am prepared to participate in an informal and unannounced committee provided you can ensure that it is merely a means of keeping us more fully informed on the financial and other aspects of interest to Australia. It must not in any circumstances become, or appear to become, a forum for discussion of policy on the economic and political issues surrounding E.R.P.[3]</p>
