I"ó'<p>[LONDON], 13 July 1942</p>

<p>I had nearly an hour with Cripps this morning. I told him that I</p>

<p>had come to see him because of the state of complete frustration</p>

<p>into which I was getting. Cripps interjected at once that I was</p>

<p>not the only person suffering from such a feeling.</p>

<p>I then explained to him what was causing my present attitude. I</p>

<p>said it was caused by two things-the first was that as a member of</p>

<p>the War Cabinet I did not appear to be getting any information or</p>

<p>being consulted about anything and that I was not at all sure that</p>

<p>my position was not the position of the other members of the War</p>

<p>Cabinet-the second was that when one initiated anything nothing</p>

<p>appeared to happen. I instanced on the second point the Note I</p>

<p>sent to the Prime Minister with regard to the Air against the Sea.</p>

<p>[1] I then outlined to Cripps what had happened, including the</p>

<p>report by Slessor and Brind and Portalâ€™s rejection of it.</p>

<p>I found that Cripps had been in touch with Slessor and had some</p>

<p>knowledge of what had been happening and he added to my knowledge</p>

<p>the interesting information that Pound and Portal nearly came to</p>

<p>blows when the report was up before the Chiefs of Staff Committee.</p>

<p>I stressed to Cripps that this aspect showed an impossible</p>

<p>position. Nothing was more urgent than to get this question put on</p>

<p>a proper basis and yet all that had been achieved in a month was</p>

<p>to find ourselves at the point from which we had started plus an</p>

<p>intensification of the feeling between the Air Ministry and the</p>

<p>Navy.</p>

<p>I suggested that this was intolerable and unless we could alter</p>

<p>that state of things we should end up by losing the war. Cripps</p>

<p>agreed and said that his mind had been turning in the direction of</p>

<p>an advisory body to the Minister of Defence, which would consist</p>

<p>of individual members of the three Services who would be</p>

<p>completely divorced from their particular Services. I said that I</p>

<p>quite agreed with that idea provided that in addition to being</p>

<p>advised by this body the Prime Minister would consult regularly</p>

<p>with his War Cabinet. I also suggested that to this body might</p>

<p>well be added a fourth member dealing with questions of scientific</p>

<p>research and new weapons.</p>

<p>I then told Cripps the approach that had been made to me on this</p>

<p>question, outlining to him the discussions with Butler and the</p>

<p>move on to John Anderson. [2]</p>

<p>Cripps agreed that these two questions were of major importance.</p>

<p>He tended to the view, which I think is probably right, that they</p>

<p>have to be dealt with separately, and then gave many examples of</p>

<p>the people who had communicated with him on the scientific side</p>

<p>complaining that the organisation was not working satisfactorily</p>

<p>and in many cases that their own individual services were not</p>

<p>being utilised.</p>

<p>I then urged on Cripps that it was no use our merely sitting there</p>

<p>and discussing the position and coming to the conclusion that</p>

<p>things were not as they should be, we had got to do something to</p>

<p>remedy it.</p>

<p>Cripps agreed with this but stressed the difficulty of handling</p>

<p>the Prime Minister who had such very definite preconceived</p>

<p>notions. In any case Cripps urged that it was necessary to know</p>

<p>exactly what you wanted altered, how you wanted it altered and</p>

<p>that the members of the War Cabinet should be agreed upon the</p>

<p>point. He said that it was no use the War Cabinet approaching the</p>

<p>Prime Minister if everyone had got different ideas; that the Prime</p>

<p>Minister would then play one off against the other and demonstrate</p>

<p>that the situation as it was, was as satisfactory as it could be.</p>

<p>I then reverted to the suggestion of the three military advisers</p>

<p>to be divorced from their respective Services, and said that that</p>

<p>at least would be a start and that if the Prime Minister could be</p>

<p>persuaded to accept that and reasonable consultation with the War</p>

<p>Cabinet could be ensured, the position might gradually be righted.</p>

<p>With this Cripps agreed, but he then showed that his own mind was</p>

<p>becoming worried about the position. He said quite frankly that</p>

<p>there were a considerable number of people in the country who</p>

<p>looked to him to ensure that things were all right and he clearly</p>

<p>was doubtful whether he was quite honouring his obligations to</p>

<p>them. It also came out in the conversation that Cripps has not had</p>

<p>any personal contact with the Prime Minister for some time. From</p>

<p>this I would rather gather that his visit to Chequers when he was</p>

<p>going to raise the question of Duncan and Sinclair, about which he</p>

<p>spoke to me when I last saw him [3], had not materialised. I</p>

<p>judged from the general tone of the conversation, which was very</p>

<p>different from that when we met before, when Cripps indicated that</p>

<p>he was in very close touch with the Prime Minister, that recently</p>

<p>he had been held more at arms length.</p>

<p>The conversation, which had started on the note that unless I</p>

<p>could get my position more satisfactorily dealt with I was</p>

<p>doubtful if I could go on, rather turned at the end in the</p>

<p>direction of Cripps feeling very much the same way in regard to</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<p>I judged that Cripps is considerably worried by the position and</p>

<p>is somewhat perplexed as to what line he should take. I think the</p>

<p>one thing which weighs with him very much is that he does not</p>

<p>feel, in taking a definite line, he would get any real support</p>

<p>from the other members of the War Cabinet.</p>

<p>After we had drifted for a little time into the above atmosphere</p>

<p>we came back to the question of what we should attempt to do, and</p>

<p>Cripps then sent for a Memorandum which he said he had not</p>

<p>prepared himself but with which he was in very considerable</p>

<p>agreement. [4] When the Memorandum arrived he gave it to me and</p>

<p>suggested I should glance through it. As it was a fairly long one,</p>

<p>and obviously dealt with the position in some detail, I said that</p>

<p>I was afraid that was not much use to me as I took a little time</p>

<p>to absorb anything. Cripps then suggested that I should take the</p>

<p>Memorandum with me and read it quietly. This I agreed to do and</p>

<p>the conversation then ended.</p>

<p>With regard to the Memorandum, it was a fairly long document and</p>

<p>broadly the proposal it made was down the lines of the three</p>

<p>military advisers divorced from their respective Services, but it</p>

<p>proposed that the Secretary of State for Air, and the Secretary of</p>

<p>State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty should be</p>

<p>abolished, and all their powers be concentrated in a new Minister</p>

<p>for War, who really would be the successor to the Minister for</p>

<p>Defence.</p>

<p>With regard to the three particular Services it was contemplated</p>

<p>that a Minister should preside over the Navy Board, the Army Board</p>

<p>and the Air Council, but that they should all three be under the</p>

<p>direct control of the Minister for War.</p>

<p>It also contemplated the abolition of the Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>organisation and the Cabinet Secretariat, the two being merged</p>

<p>into the War Ministry.</p>

<p>This proposal is working in the right direction but to attempt to</p>

<p>bring it all about at one blow seems to me to ignore practical</p>

<p>difficulties. I accordingly sent the Memorandum back to Cripps</p>

<p>with the letter attached hereto. [5]</p>

<p>1 Bruceâ€™s note of 16 June to Churchill (on file AA: M100, June</p>

<p>1942) dealt with a matter currently in dispute between the</p>

<p>Admiralty and the Air Ministry, viz. the best use to be made of</p>

<p>long-range aircraft (see J. R. M. Butler, Grand Strategy, vol.</p>

<p>III, part II, HMSO, London, 1964, PP. 533-40). Bruce argued that</p>

<p>resources should be devoted not only to bombing Germany, but to</p>

<p>providing â€˜effective air action against the seaâ€™ and urged â€˜the</p>

<p>immediate appointment of a small high powered Committeeâ€™ presided</p>

<p>over by â€˜a Cabinet Minister not associated with either the Navy or</p>

<p>Air Forceâ€™ to examine â€˜how our aerial offensive power against the</p>

<p>sea can be strengthened both on a long-term basis and</p>

<p>immediatelyâ€™. A portion of the note is quoted in the Second</p>

<p>Enclosure to Document 52. At a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on</p>

<p>24 June, Portal strongly opposed Bruceâ€™s suggestion but it was</p>

<p>agreed that he and Pound should each nominate an officer to review</p>

<p>the general policy for employment of the air forces on the basis</p>

<p>of the priorities laid down by Churchill and Roosevelt at</p>

<p>Washington in December 1941. Accordingly, Rear-Admiral E. J. P.</p>

<p>Brind and Air Vice Marshal J. C. Slessor produced a report on 2</p>

<p>July (not found on Commonwealth Govt files) which supported the</p>

<p>Navyâ€™s case.</p>

<p>2 Sir Henry Tizard had approached Bruce to enlist his support for</p>

<p>a plan to co-ordinate matters relating to new weapons and</p>

<p>scientific investigation. R. A. Butler and Sir John Anderson had</p>

<p>also been consulted on the matter. See Bruceâ€™s note of a</p>

<p>conversation with Tizard on 8 July (on file AA:M100, July 1942).</p>

<p>3 See Bruceâ€™s note of a conversation with Cripps on 2 July (on the</p>

<p>file cited in note 2). Cripps appears to have intended suggesting</p>

<p>to Churchill that Sir Andrew Duncan and Sir Archibald Sinclair be</p>

<p>removed from the War Cabinet.</p>
