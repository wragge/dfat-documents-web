<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram. [1]</p>

<p>We feel that in view of the nature and size of his audience,</p>

<p>President Roosevelt’s remarks will probably reach a wider circle,</p>

<p>possibly in distorted form and may have repercussions. We,</p>

<p>therefore, thought it advisable to instruct His Majesty’s United</p>

<p>Kingdom Ambassador to sound a note of caution in Washington. Lord</p>

<p>Halifax accordingly asked Mr. Hull very confidentially whether the</p>

<p>President’s remarks represented a concerted White House - State</p>

<p>Department policy, whether the President had considered his</p>

<p>proposals in relation to American pledges and whether the State</p>

<p>Department had considered the question of French Pacific</p>

<p>possessions in the light of a possible post war security system in</p>

<p>that area.</p>

<p>Mr. Hull replied that he had no more knowledge of the matter than</p>

<p>Lord Halifax. It is plain, therefore, that the President’s remarks</p>

<p>did not represent any settled policy in which the State Department</p>

<p>was concerned. Mr. Hull said that he did, from time to time,</p>

<p>remind the President of the pledges given in relation to France</p>

<p>and added that he supposed that the President and Mr. Churchill</p>

<p>would be talking about the matter more closely at a later date.</p>
