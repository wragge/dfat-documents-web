<p>MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Your P.45. [1]</p>

<p>After most anxious consideration Government has decided that it cannot agree to the proposal that 7th A.I.F. Division should be diverted to Burma. [2]</p>

<p>2. A.I.F. Divisions were to be sent to the vital Netherlands East Indies sector, to help stop the southern thrust of the enemy. it has apparently been decided by Wavell [3] that this sector is not to be reinforced further. To carry out the same objective the destination to which they should now proceed is obviously Australia, which is in imminent danger of attack, which is an essential allied base and which is the nearest area of concentration south of Netherlands East Indies.</p>

<p>3. Cable just received from Lavarack [4] regarding Wavellâ€™s suggestion of diversion to Burma finishes as follows:-</p>

<p>â€˜Not personally in position to judge Australian home defence position owing considerable absence. If this reasonably satisfactory believe Australiaâ€™s best interests served by course suggested. This despite natural desire Australian Corps assist direct defence own homeland if considered necessary.â€™ Position is that mainly owing our efforts overseas, home defence position is, in opinion of our Chiefs of General Staff, not satisfactory. Therefore we cannot approve of the proposed diversion.</p>
