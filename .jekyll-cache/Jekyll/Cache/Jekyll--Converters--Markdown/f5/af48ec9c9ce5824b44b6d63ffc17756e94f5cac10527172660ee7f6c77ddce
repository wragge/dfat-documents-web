I"g<p>Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 17 February 1942, 3.53 p.m.</p>

<p>Personal for Minister for External Affairs to be decyphered by Tilley [1]:Your telegram 16th Feby [2], following from Sir Stafford Cripps [3] begins:-</p>

<p>Personal from Cripps to Evatt alone: Secret and confidential.</p>

<p>I was delighted to hear from and of you and very much hope that you will be coming to this country before long to represent Australia for a time at least.</p>

<p>I fully realize your outlook and have the greatest sympathy for it. I have had a long talk to Bruce [4] who asked me to see him this evening, and his views are very similar to your own as to the necessity for drastic changes here. I am doing my best to persuade those in authority to act in this direction and shall not undertake any public opposition until I am convinced that persuasion from within is of no avail.</p>

<p>I regard the facade of unity as of the greatest importance internationally at the present moment and the present supreme leadership essential to be retained, unless there is complete resistance to reorganization.</p>

<p>You can rely on me to do my utmost to help in the direction that you wish.</p>

<p>Judging by my overwhelming correspondence there is a strong feeling in the country that we must reorganize our Government.</p>
