  <li>RESTRICTED IMMEDIATE</li>
</ol>

<p>Your 233<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and our 223<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We are firmly of the opinion that it is not desirable at present to attempt an Exhibition directing attention principally to the Colombo Plan and possibilities of its implementation. For this reason and because of the kind of Exhibition contemplated by Ceylon it is essential that the Ceylon Government make it clear in organizing the Exhibition and in any publicity that it is primarily national in nature with a section on the Colombo Plan incorporated. Name should be changed to some more general term such as ‘Colombo Exhibition’. Our soundings of other members of Consultative Committee indicate that there is general agreement on this principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministerial approval would be dependent upon participation by other members of Consultative Committee, as well as on costs, etc. We would prefer, for general reasons, that as far as practicable you leave it to others to raise these points, and you should avoid appearing to be unduly critical of the proposal. Please report as fully as possible views advanced by Ceylon and others at the meeting.</p>
  </li>
