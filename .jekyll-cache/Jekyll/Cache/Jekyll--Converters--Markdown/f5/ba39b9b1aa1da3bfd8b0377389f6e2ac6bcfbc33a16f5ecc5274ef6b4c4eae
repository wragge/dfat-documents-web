<p>PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>My dear Prime Minister,</p>

<p>Yesterday I took Harry Gibson [1], of the Melbourne Trades Hall, out to lunch and we had an interesting talk.</p>

<p>Through Major Fuhrman [2], Gibson had wired to me from Geneva asking for information about Imperial Preference as he desired to discuss the subject with the other British Empire Workersâ€™ Delegates. He told me that a very useful beginning had been made towards the idea of regular meetings of the Empire Workersâ€™ Delegates, and I was delighted to find how clearly he appreciated the possibilities latent in such meetings. Unfortunately, owing to the British General Election, the British Delegation was weak, the only firstclass man among the six or seven advisers to the official Workersâ€™ Delegate being Ernest Bevin [3], of the Transport Union.</p>

<p>Gibson stated strongly his opinion that, in the past, the Australian Workersâ€™ Delegate has been ineffective at Geneva and this for two reasons: firstly the fact that the delegate changes each year and comes alone without technical assistants, and, secondly, because some of the delegates have regarded the whole affair as a holiday. Gibson would like to see some element of continuity and mentioned the dispatch of a technical assistant with the Workersâ€™ Delegate, the technical assistant to be a man who had already had experience as a delegate. Gibson thought that Australia would thus be able to pull her weight and the scheme might lead to effective Inter-Imperial collaboration in this field with generally beneficial effects in other fields of Imperial economic cooperation.</p>

<p>I have arranged for Gibson to lunch with me again in ten days time when I am hoping to get Tom Johnston [4] to meet him.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL</p>
