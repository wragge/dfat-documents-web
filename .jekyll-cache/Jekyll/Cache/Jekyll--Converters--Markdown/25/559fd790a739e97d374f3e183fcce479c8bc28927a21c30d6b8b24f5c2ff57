I"ñ<p>Letter CANBERRA, 23 June 1947</p>

<p>PERSONAL</p>

<p>I have been meaning to write re Denfeld and Manus-and now attach two telegrams, one from the United Kingdom and our reply. [1] These, I think, together with announcement made on his departure (copy attached) are as much as there is to it.</p>

<p>The man was only here for three days-and that during a week-end.</p>

<p>Discussions were informal and lasted only a few hours. It was clear United States have no intention to spend money south of their new possessions, but it is equally clear Denfeld has a service interest in the whole area. Hence, no interest in Manus, but considerable interest in staff talks and staff consultation.</p>

<p>This is not unacceptable to us. No other bases were discussed at any stage.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Presumably cablegram 123, dated 17 June, requesting information on progress of discussions between Australia and the United States on Manus, and Document 205.</p>
