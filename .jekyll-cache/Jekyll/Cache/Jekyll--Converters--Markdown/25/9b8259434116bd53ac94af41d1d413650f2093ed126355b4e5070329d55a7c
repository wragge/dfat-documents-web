<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 611. [1] At risk of reporting what you may already know, Chairman J.I.C. yesterday evening disclosed the receipt of a telegram from F.O. meeting of Bevin and Stikker. [2] Stikker was adamant that further police action was necessary as all indications are that there will be need [3] for [4] have Dutch army domination in Batavia. [5]</p>

<p>1 Document 292.</p>

<p>2 The reference is presumably to a meeting between Stikker and Bevin in Paris on 26 October.</p>
