<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 230. [1]</p>

<p>1. I have now seen United Kingdom Consul-General who tells me Republican Ministers also visited him. Among other things he urged them to make a final attempt to induce Republican cabinet to issue statement that orders were being given for cessation of hostilities and for withdrawal, and that it was assumed Dutch would do the same without delay.</p>

<p>2. He agrees that Van Mook and most of his advisers are completely adamant and that no useful purpose would be served by any approach to the Dutch authorities here.</p>

<p>3. We both feel, and he has so reported to his Government, that pressure at The Hague alone may now avert war.</p>
