<p>IMPORTANT TOP SECRET &amp; PERSONAL</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram, control of Japan. [1]</p>

<p>My immediately following telegram [2] contains the draft amended terms of reference for the Far Eastern Advisory Commission which were worked out here in agreement with the United States Delegation as the proposal which the United Kingdom representative on the Commission would put forward as soon as the Commission met in Washington and which the United States Government would then support. It was on this understanding that the Foreign Secretary wrote to the United States Secretary of State as in paragraph 5 of my telegram under reference. We should be grateful if the amended terms of reference and the fact that the United States Government are prepared to support them could be treated for the present with the utmost secrecy.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Bevin has asked Mr. Byrnes privately to ensure that the position is not prejudiced by publication of the terms of reference originally proposed by the United States Government [3] and has suggested that no more need be published at this stage than the fact that a Commission of representatives of certain powers is being set up and will hold its first meeting in Washington.</p>
