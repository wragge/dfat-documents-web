<p>SECRET</p>

<p>I had a long talk today to Hopkins, formerly Secretary of Commerce, who lives in the White House. I am on confidential terms with him. This may be used as a discreet channel to Presidentâ€™s [1] ear.</p>

<p>President has returned completely refreshed and determined to tackle main problems. Statement on increased help to Britain despite financial difficulties is first shot. He will continue to emphasize menace to United States to justify his standpoint particularly since getting Churchillâ€™s recent communication. [2] President was well aware of realities of British situation and realises that great responsibility rests on himself as regards the future.</p>

<p>I suggested to Hopkins that it might be mutually valuable if American Federation of Labour were to suggest invitation to representative of the Australian labour man [3], possibly politician, to visit this country. He said he would suggest this to them.</p>
