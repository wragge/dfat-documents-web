<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR ACTING PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 37. [1]</p>

<p>In extension of the first paragraph of telegram No. 313. [2]</p>

<p>Both yours and Curtin’s [3] statements [4] admirable and equally met the situation here. They were released and pushed by the Legation and Bailey [5] to all press and radio sources.</p>

<p>Additionally I sent copies to the Secretary of States [6], to a number of leading Congress men and to all useful quarters.</p>

<p>Both statements carried by all press news services and published practically all over the United States, in fact far wider publication than original offending messages. Radio networks, on request, co-operated splendidly. National Broadcast Company particularly, repeated the statements all day in net-work news- summaries and in late evening news round-up.</p>

<p>By reason of inference that Australian Labour was at least hesitant on war Curtin’s statement particularly useful.</p>

<p>Types of headlines in important papers as follows Australia Vows Full Aid in War.</p>

<p>Australia Sends Pledge.</p>

<p>Australia-British Rift Denied, Axis Plot Charged.</p>

<p>Australia Denies Disunity with Britain.</p>

<p>Australia Denies German Propaganda.</p>

<p>Australia’s Wholehearted Participation in the War Unaffected.</p>

<p>Justice Frankfurter [7] sent the following telegram to Evatt [8] ‘Congratulate you on Mr. Curtin’s statement. Please express to him a stranger’s admiration for confirming so eloquently Australia’s dedication. Warm regards.’</p>
