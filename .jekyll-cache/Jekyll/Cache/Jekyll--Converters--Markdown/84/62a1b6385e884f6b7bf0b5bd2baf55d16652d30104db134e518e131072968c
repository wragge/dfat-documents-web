<p>MOST IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 28th October, [1] I am in general agreement with the point of view you put and hope you will, like me, send preliminary appeals to the United Kingdom Government to be in no hurry with an answer to the French Government and to give the Dominions full opportunity of expressing their views.</p>

<p>Matter is one of utmost importance both for war and peace thereafter.</p>
