<p>1. Minister has had preliminary talk with Langenhove, the permanent Belgian representative to United Nations, regarding the designation of the third country for the Security Council arbitration committee on Indonesia.</p>

<p>2. Langenhove said his Government favoured the United States.

Langenhove was noticeably cool to mention of Killearn.</p>
