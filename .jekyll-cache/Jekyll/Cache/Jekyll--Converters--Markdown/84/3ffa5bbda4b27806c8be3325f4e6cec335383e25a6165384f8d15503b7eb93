<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Your No. 74. [1]</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the suggestion is there should be loaned from the public administration a suitable officer or whether it is desired we recommend to the Republicans a person whom we regard as being suitable. It seems to us that it would be in the best interests of the Republicans for them to appoint a person whom we might recommend rather than to have on loan from us an officer of the Commonwealth public administration as this might be open to criticisms by Republican supporters.</p>

<p>Please advise. Meanwhile we are getting into touch with likely persons.</p>
