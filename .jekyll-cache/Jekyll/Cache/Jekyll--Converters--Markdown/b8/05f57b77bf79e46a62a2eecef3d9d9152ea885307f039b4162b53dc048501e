<p>Following personal for Minister External Affairs from justice Frankfurter. [1]</p>

<p>[Begins] I have seen, of course most privately and confidentially, your message to Casey [2] and Presidentâ€™s reply. [3] I can assure you of most anxious and sympathetic understanding here of the circumstances and the needs immediately touching the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I know that point of view of the President is taken in full light of the whole situation and I believe in the interests of Australia in the long run and which may not be a very long run. Regards.</p>
