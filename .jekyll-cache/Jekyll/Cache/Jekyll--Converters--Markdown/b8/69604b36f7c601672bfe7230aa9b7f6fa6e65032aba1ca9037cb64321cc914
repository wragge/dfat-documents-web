<p>SECRET FOR PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>I talked with Inskip [1] last night as to the international situation. He is as you know a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. [2]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>RUSSIA. Negotiations with Russia are proving difficult. [3] I emphasised to him our great interest in not throwing Japan into the arms of the Axis Powers. Although the Japanese are proving difficult in respect of International Settlements, the view is held here that if a major conflict broke out in Europe immediate Japanese participation is unlikely.</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>The High Commissioner [4] arrives in London on Monday evening [5] and he will communicate with you in relation to further developments.</p>
