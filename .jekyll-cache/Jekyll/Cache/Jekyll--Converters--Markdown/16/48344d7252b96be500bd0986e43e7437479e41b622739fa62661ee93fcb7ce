I"ß<p>Cablegram 222 CANBERRA, 18 November 1944</p>

<p>PERSONAL FOR STIRLING ONLY IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Please convey the following personal and private message from me to Cranborne alone- Begins-May I ask you to study terms of telegram No. 325 to Australian Government. [1] It might well do harm in several directions. I hope you will be able to do something tangible to meet our views not only in this matter but also on all aspects of the recent Australian - New Zealand conclusions reached at Wellington. I think it may still be possible to reconcile divergent approaches, but even if it is not we should be able to agree to differ. Telegram 325 recalls Colonial Office despatches of the distant past.</p>

<p>W. S. Robinson [2] arrived yesterday and sends his regards to the Prime Minister, Mr. Bracken and yourself.</p>

<p>Best Wishes. Ends.</p>
