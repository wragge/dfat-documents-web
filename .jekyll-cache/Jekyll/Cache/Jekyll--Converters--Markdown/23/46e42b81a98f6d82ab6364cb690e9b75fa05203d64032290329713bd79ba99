<p>144. Secret</p>

<p><strong>Indonesia and Malaya</strong></p>

<p>I saw Tunku this morning and reiterated points in your telegram 125.<a href="#f1">1</a> Tunku said he was now exercising restraint. However, in past Malaya had looked up to Indonesia and Indonesians were endeavouring to take advantage of this. To maintain Malaya solidarity it was necessary to answer occasionally some attacks where possible through information service.</p>

<p>2. On four suggestions, Narasimham had brought to Razak (my 133)<a href="#f2">2</a> Tunku agreed on need to end public exchanges between Malaya and Indonesia and that there could be advantage in talks about incidents at sea. He denied that Malayans had supported Sumatran dissidents and stressed that P.R.R.I. refugees had only been given asylum on condition that they avoided politics (I would <em>not</em> expect him to agree to their expulsion).</p>

<p>3. When I urged early exchange of Ambassadors Tunku admitted that he had told Ghazali<a href="#f3">3</a> that he was opposed to accepting Djatikasumo.<a href="#f4">4</a> He did <em>not</em> like his looks (untrustworthy eyes), or some statements made when Consulâ€“General in Singapore. I made a strong case for accepting Djatikasumo based on damage of refusal, on his being good choice and on my own personal experience of him. Tunku agreed to reconsider decision after consulting Lee Kuan Yew and Lim Yew {Hock}.<a href="#f5">5</a> He would only agree to appoint Malayan Ambassador in his own time and I could not shake him on this.</p>

<p>4. Tunku assured me that Malaya was now making major effort to win international support for Malaysia. As well as intensive diplomatic effort, he was writing personally to Governments throughout the world explaining that new federation was giving independence in accordance with wishes of people concerned.</p>

<p>5. Towards end of our meeting, Tunku tended to lapse back into view that it was necessary to stand firm and that concessions were useless in unstable condition of Indonesia today. He feels intuitively that this is correct policy and that Indonesia must break up soon. My attempts to argue gained little headway but I should be in stronger position after visiting Djakarta. Tunku said he would endeavour to see me again before my departure but after Puasa<a href="#f6">6</a> when he could explain more lucidly his viewpoint.</p>
