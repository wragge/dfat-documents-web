<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>A representative of Asiatic Investment Company named Buchan has just been to see me in regard to Timor oil position before leaving for Sydney by air today.</p>

<p>He professes to desire to negotiate with the Australian Government with a view to his Company co-operating. I advised him to make a frank explanation of the position. He was clearly anxious for information of progress made by Oil Search, but I merely said I had no recent information.</p>
