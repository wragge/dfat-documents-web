<p>PERSONAL TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your No. 6 of 12th January. Approach by Pakistan representative.</p>

<p>In conformity with Government policy, the export of arms is not being permitted to any country and no exception can be made of India, Pakistan or any Indian State.</p>

<p>2. The only communication we are aware of from the Commonwealth Relations Office on this subject is a message transmitted by the United Kingdom High Commissioner here on 31st December, in which it was mentioned that the United Kingdom Government would endeavour to satisfy as far as possible through military procurement channels reasonable demands for the three services of each Dominion and in which we were asked our policy. In our reply the United Kingdom High Commissioner was informed of the steps taken to prohibit arms exports. No communication was made to the Indian or Pakistan Governments, it being decided to await any approach before notifying our attitude.</p>

<p>3. You should accordingly inform the Pakistan High Commissioner that it is regretted that established Government policy does not permit the export of warlike stores from Australia to any country.</p>

<p>Any similar request from India would therefore meet with the same reply.</p>
