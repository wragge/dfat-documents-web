I"E<p>Cablegram 178 CANBERRA, 10 August 1945</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Reference radio reports Japanese acceptance of surrender. We assume that no reply will be sent by the United Kingdom Government until full information is communicated to Australian Government and our reply received in London. Recent telegrams received indicate that our views will be considered [1] but we have no real assurance that decisions prior to consultation will not be made.</p>

<p>This matter is of vital importance to us.</p>
