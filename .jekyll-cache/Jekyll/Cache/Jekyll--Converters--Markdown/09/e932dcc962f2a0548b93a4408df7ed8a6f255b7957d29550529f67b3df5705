I"“<p>Cablegram Department 73, TOKYO, 12 February 1948, 9.30 a.m.</p>

<p>My telegram 7. Following is summary of Jacksonâ€™s broadcast from Seoul on February 10th.</p>

<p>He spoke as Chairman of the Sub-Commission set up to interview Korean political personalities of all shades of political opinion. Committee had already interviewed a large number of Koreans but there was still a considerable number in Northern Zone of Korea and in custody or under surveillance in North or South whom they had been unable to interview. Two invitations had been sent but as yet no reply had been received. Jackson repeated terms of invitation and assured those invited that anything they said to Commission would be treated with the utmost confidence.</p>

<p>Jackson also read text of a letter to the American Commander in Southern Zone and the Russian Commander in Northern Zone asking for their co-operation in releasing from custody any Koreans whom Commission requested to testify. A reply promising co-operation had been received from the American Commander but no reply had yet been received from the Russian Commander.</p>
