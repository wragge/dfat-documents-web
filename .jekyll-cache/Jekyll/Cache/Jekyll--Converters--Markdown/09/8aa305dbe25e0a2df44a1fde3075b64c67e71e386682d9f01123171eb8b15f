<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>Although the appointment of Caldecote [1] in my view distinctly unhappy he will be as effective as Eden. He does not possess the personality or drive necessary to put over Dominion views with the War Cabinet and has not a receptive or constructive mind. The appointment of a discarded Lord Chancellor is not complimentary to the Dominions.</p>

<p>Malcolm MacDonald [2] would have been much preferable.</p>

<p>For your very personal information, I would have welcomed the appointment of Lloyd George [3] as with his personality and force it would have been possible to get something done.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Caldecote succeeded Eden as U.K. Dominions Secretary on 15 May 1940.</p>

<p>2 U.K. Minister for Health. He had been Dominions Secretary in 1935-38 and 1938-39.</p>

<p>3 U.K. Prime Minister 1916-22.</p>
