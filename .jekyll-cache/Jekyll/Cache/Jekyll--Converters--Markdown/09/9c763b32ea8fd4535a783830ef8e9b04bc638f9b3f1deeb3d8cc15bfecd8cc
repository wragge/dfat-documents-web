<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Pending my return and further instructions, F.E.C. decision on Japanese whaling should not be pressed by Australia. At the same time Australia should not herself take steps to request postponement. [1]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>On 4 September the subject of Japanese whaling was removed from the Commissionâ€™s agenda with the unanimous agreement of FEC members. Debate was effectively silenced until the United States foreshadowed plans for a 1948-49 expedition.</p>

<p>1 Chifley reported this decision to Attlee in reply to Document 404.</p>
