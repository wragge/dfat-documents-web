I"j<p>Letter [CANBERRA], 10 July 1944</p>

<p>With reference to your letter to me, dated 30th May [1], regarding your proposal to set up an organisation for post-hostilities planning in international affairs, I have examined this matter closely but feel that I cannot concur with such an organisation being set up.</p>

<p>I feel that it would ultimately result in a sort of super department exercising jurisdiction over other departments which could only, in regard particularly to Treasury and Commerce, result in friction.</p>

<p>There are matters, of course, which are wholly within the province of your Department, and as such your Department is most competent to deal with them. Apart from that, however, I feel that your proposal is not one which I could support.</p>
