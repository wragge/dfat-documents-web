<p>MOST SECRET IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>For Bruce from Evatt.</p>

<p>Your 31[A]. [1] The Australian Government, like Canada, would be delighted if the Government of Eire saw its way clear not only to remove the German and Japanese representatives but to declare a state of war with both countries.</p>

<p>But the message from de Valera [2] is not addressed to this Government and the High Commissioner for Eire [3] would hardly be authorised by de Valera to risk further rebuffs. In the circumstances we hestitate to intervene in such a matter, especially in view of what has already happened.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, it might be best for you to give no answer unless strongly pressed, and then to give no answer in writing.</p>
