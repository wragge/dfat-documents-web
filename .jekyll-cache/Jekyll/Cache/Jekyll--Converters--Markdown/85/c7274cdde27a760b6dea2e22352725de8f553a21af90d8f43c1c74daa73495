<p>2. Dealing with the actual proposals:</p>

<p>(b) Adherence of Russia is vital. For that reason, if necessary, the preamble should be made acceptable to that country.</p>

<p>(c) We feel that the order of signature should be alphabetical throughout.</p>

<p>(d) As Indiaâ€™s status is not yet that of a self governing nation the inclusion of name might be questioned.</p>
