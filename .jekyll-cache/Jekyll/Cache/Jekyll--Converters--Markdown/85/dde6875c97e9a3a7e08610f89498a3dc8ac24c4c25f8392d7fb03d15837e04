<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Canadian Government has recently suggested to Commonwealth Relations Office that there should be very informal talks in which other Commonwealth Governments might be associated regarding instructions to be given to diplomatic and consular officers overseas in the event of emergency.</p>

<p>Canadians feel this would facilitate co-operation between representatives of all Commonwealth Governments in such a case, particularly in matters such as evacuation of British subjects.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Relations Office has accordingly enquired of ourselves, New Zealand and South Africa whether we wish to join in talks here and request early reply.</p>
