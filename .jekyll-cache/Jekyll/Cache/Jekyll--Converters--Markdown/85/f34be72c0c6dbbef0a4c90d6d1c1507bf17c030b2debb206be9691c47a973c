I"F<p>Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 9 May 1940, 8.52 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your telegram May 8th. [1] Quite appreciate reason McBrideâ€™s [2] visit. Suggest desirable that he should come earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>Reference to Economic Warfare, when your cable received my mind was crystallising as a result of examination of the position to the view that any ordinary representative in the Department would achieve little and have little value for us. Idea of man of standing of Owen Dixon [3] suggests new possibilities, but examination of whether practicable and useful will take few days.</p>
