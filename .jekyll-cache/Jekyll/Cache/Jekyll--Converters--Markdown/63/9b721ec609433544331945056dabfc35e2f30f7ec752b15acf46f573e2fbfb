I"ú<p>Letter BATAVIA, 18 October 1937</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th September [1] with which you were good enough to enclose copies of correspondence with Mr Pascoe, who holds an option over the concession granted to Mr Staughton. [2]</p>

<p>2. I note that Mr Pascoe is now awaiting the result of the representations made at Lisbon.</p>

<p>3. In the meanwhile I have written to Major da Fontoura [3] enquiring for any information he can give as to the possibility of additional areas being granted to Mr Pascoe.</p>
