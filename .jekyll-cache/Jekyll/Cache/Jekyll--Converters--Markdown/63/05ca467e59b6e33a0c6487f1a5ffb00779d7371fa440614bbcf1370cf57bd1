<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Reference my immediately preceding telegram 54. [1] I have just returned from a weekend in the Ruhr and Limburg during which I was in touch with Landale by telephone.</p>

<p>2. You have to appreciate that the Netherlands Government is intensely jealous at the moment of any suggestion of diplomatic relations with the Indonesian Government (vide my telegram 46 [2]) and so the approach to Sjahrir referred to in paragraph 2 of your telegram 36 [3] was [certain] [4] to arouse both suspicion and hostility.</p>

<p>3. In the second place, their own discussions with Indonesians on economic matters are proceeding with the usual maddening deliberation and so they are very fearful of outside intervention.</p>

<p>4. Thirdly I am sure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs genuinely desires good relations with us and that was why he took the initiative reported in my telegram 50. [5] I hope I will be authorised to make a suitable reply.</p>

<p>5. A minor point is that the Dutch are incapable of quick action and a request for visas at less than twenty-four hoursâ€™ notice was certain to create difficulty. Also De Ranitz[â€™s] attitude reported in paragraphs 1 and 2 of your telegram 37 [6] does not seem to agree with reports he has sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here.</p>

<p>6. I urge again as I did in paragraph 4 of my telegram 50 that whenever possible we raise such matters informally here before steps are taken which commit us to any course of action. I am sure you will do everything to prevent the matter becoming public vide paragraph 3 of your telegram 38. [7]</p>
