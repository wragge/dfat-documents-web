I"Â<p>Cablegram 390 [1] LONDON, 4 June 1941</p>

<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>Polish Government has approached me with regard to Polish Minister for Foreign Affairsâ€™ [2] request to you of 11th March for the establishment of a Polish Consulate-General in Australia. He states that his Government have established Consulate-General in Canada and more recently fin] South Africa and New Zealand and now wish to appoint to the post of Consulate-General in Canberra (sic) an official â€˜de carriereâ€™ with diplomatic experience as soon as consent of Australian Government is forthcoming.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that there was already a Polish Consulate-General in Sydney (E.A. Consular List for 1941) but presumably the present occupant [3] is not a career man.</p>

<p>I told Raczynski [4] I would telegraph you and ascertain present position.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
