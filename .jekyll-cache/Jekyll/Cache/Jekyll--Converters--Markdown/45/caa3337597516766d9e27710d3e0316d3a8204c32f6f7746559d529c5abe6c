I"Å<p>Cablegram K228 BATAVIA, [25 December] 1948, 6.40 p.m.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT RESTRICTED</p>

<p>We shall endeavour to report in terms of the Security Council‚Äôs resolution in time for meeting on December 26th and show clearly Netherlands as aggressors.</p>

<p>2. In practice it will be impossible to enforce effectively the cease-fire hostilities order without some arrangements for demarcation lines and withdrawal of Netherlands forces. Doubtless the Dutch will claim they now control all territories in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Please number my en clair telegram today K.227.</p>
