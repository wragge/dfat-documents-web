<p><strong>Indonesia/Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>In discussions with colleagues and the Government to which you are accredited, please take all available opportunities to stress the following points:â€”</p>

<p>1. Australia remains anxious to explore every avenue of possible agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>

<p>2. Malaysia is now an international fact of life and an accepted member of the United Nations. No question of recognition or non-recognition by individual states has any relevance to its established international existence.</p>

<p>3. For Indonesia to seek to crush or destroy it is not only a breach of the United Nations Charter but an act of aggression which must earn general disapprobation.</p>

<p>4. The presence of Indonesian trained, controlled and led guerillas on Malaysian territory and their reinforcement under cover of the Kennedy negotiated cease fire, is not a â€˜political questionâ€™ to be negotiated.</p>

<p>5. Malaysia tried hard at both the Tripartite Foreign Ministersâ€™ meeting to reach an accommodation with Indonesia but clearly this cannot be achieved until the present process of re-inforcing the Indonesian guerillas in Malaysia is reversed and their withdrawal begins.</p>

<p>6. Negotiations for the re-establishment of normal relations between Malaysia and Indonesia can only be between sovereign states recognising and respecting each otherâ€™s territorial integrity.</p>

<p>7. Maphilindo cannot prosper when one partner claims the right to invade the territory of another and stimulate a revolution in it.</p>
