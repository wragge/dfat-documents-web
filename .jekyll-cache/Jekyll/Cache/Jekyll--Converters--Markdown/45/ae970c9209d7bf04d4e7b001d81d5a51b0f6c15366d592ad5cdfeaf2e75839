I"T<p>Cablegram 530 WASHINGTON, 8 June 1944, 7.50 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Following for Forde, Acting Prime Minister, from the Prime Minister. 1. My view of the Monetary Conference is that Australia should find the notice for representation on the Ministerial level [1] too short and that we should in the circumstances regretfully intimate accordingly while agreeing to send an expert to the Conference who could be Brigden.</p>

<p>2. In view of events in Europe the United Kingdom is really wishful to avoid discussion now but is being pushed by the President who desires material helpful for local political scene.</p>

<p>3. Melvilleâ€™s memo [2] indicates not wise for Australia to be tied up at this stage to plans devised regardless of our special circumstances. 4. I feel we should avoid the level of representation at the Conference which would imply Governmental participation in any findings reached though I doubt that findings can be reached.</p>
