<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 30 [1]</p>

<p>I reported in my telegram No. 71 [2] the reluctance of the Acting President to express any opinion at present and Sun Foâ€™s support of the proposition. As Sun is a very lukewarm supporter of negotiation, his attitude is more calculated to embarrass the efforts of the Acting President than to help them.</p>

<p>2. The only response from the Communist side was in a broadcast from North Shensi on 13th February. It was against any mediation or intervention. But as these broadcasts are for propaganda purposes mainly, I am waiting in hope of getting some clearer indication of the real views of the Communist leaders. Such can come only by very indirect ways which take time.</p>

<p>3. The Acting Presidentâ€™s efforts to open negotiations are at a very delicate stage.</p>

<p>His personal emissaries in Peking are believed to be on the point of making direct contact with Mao Tse Tung. Shao Li Tse, the Acting Presidentâ€™s chief emissary, is said to be â€˜somewhat optimisticâ€™. But there are strong influences at work to wreck negotiations (see Leeâ€™s telegram No. C4, paragraph 3) and it would be very easy to do so.</p>

<p>4. I think that it is best to make no move for the moment but to allow time for Li Tsung Jen to work on the lines he thinks best.</p>

<p>If he appeared to be faced by failure the time would be ripe probably for a fresh suggestion.</p>

<p>1 Dispatched 21 February, it expressed surprise that officer had made no mention of Ministerâ€™s suggestion on mediation or possible response from other party.</p>
