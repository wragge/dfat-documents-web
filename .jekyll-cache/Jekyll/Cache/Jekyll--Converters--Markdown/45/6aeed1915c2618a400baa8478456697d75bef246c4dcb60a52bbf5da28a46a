I"B<p>Cablegram 128 6 October 1939,</p>

<p>I have issued the following statement to Australian press this afternoon begins- ‘The report which has appeared in certain newspapers this morning of a projected meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers in London next year is due to a misunderstanding of something said by me yesterday.</p>

<p>When asked whether I would be the Minister to go to London I said “No”, but indicated unofficially in answer to a question that at a later stage of the war the precedent established in the last war when Dominion Prime Ministers attended in London might conceivably be followed.</p>

<p>I might add that no arrangement, tentative or otherwise, has been made for me to go to London. I have plenty to do here.’ (Statement ends).</p>
