<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Working Group on Portuguese Timor</p>

<p>Three things are clear:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Portuguese will do nothing for the Timorese.</li>
  <li>The United States will not support Portuguese colonialism.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The Indonesians will move against the territory; if they achieve their end by force (and there is nothing to prevent them), it will be a most serious encouragement to irresponsible and expansionist elements in Indonesia and it will do the greatest harm to Australiaâ€™s long-term interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The United States and the United Kingdom are looking to Australia to take some initiative to avoid the Western world finding itself in a situation where a nationalistic revolutionary power, backed by Russian arms, can achieve its ends by force of arms. This power is at Australiaâ€™s doorstep.</li>
  <li>I want a Working Group on Portuguese Timor to explore all possible measures: and to analyse developments which, if they can be initiated or encouraged, would produce the least embarrassment to Australiaâ€™s foreign policy and national interests.</li>
  <li>The deliberations of the Working Group are to be kept highly confidential; and it should report within three weeks. <a href="#f1">1</a></li>
</ol>
