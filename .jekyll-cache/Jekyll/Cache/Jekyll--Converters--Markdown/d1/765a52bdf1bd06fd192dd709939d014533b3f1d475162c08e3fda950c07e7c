I"¯<p>Cablegram 63 28 May 1940,</p>

<p>Reference telegram No 98 of May 28 [1] I think it advisable that you return to Washington immediately and remain during the forthcoming critical period. The idea and belief of the Prime Minister [2] was that you would communicate his message personally to the President [3] and support it with your own representations.</p>

<p>It is felt that an indirect communication loses its intended effect and it is desired you ask an interview immediately you return to supplement and support the Prime Ministerâ€™s message.</p>
