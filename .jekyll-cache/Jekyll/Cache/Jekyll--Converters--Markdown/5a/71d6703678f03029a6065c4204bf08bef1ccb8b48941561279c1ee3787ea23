I"ì<p>Cablegram M75 LONDON, 22 April 1941, 6.13 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Reference my earlier cable re conversation with Dill [1] and the probability of giving Blamey [2] a higher post in the Middle East organisation, I am now authorised by the Prime Minister [3] to say that subject to our approval it is proposed to appoint Blamey Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. This does not mean that he has the reversion of post of Commander-in-Chief should Wavell for any reason go elsewhere because the position would naturally then be looked at afresh. However it is not only a high compliment to Blamey of whose work Wavell speaks in most glowing terms, but should give satisfaction in Australia as a guarantee that our leader will have an effective voice at the right time.</p>

<p>Please telegraph concurrence of yourself and Spender. [4] If you concur as I am sure you will, please send me en clair word â€˜yesâ€™ most immediate. [5] I will make announcement in a broadcast that I am making to Australia tomorrow morning. You will realise that for this to be possible every degree of urgency is required.</p>
