<p>Reference is requested to paragraph 20 of the report of the Consultative Committee Meeting<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup> held in Colombo in February in which the Government of Ceylon proposed a â€˜Colombo Plan Exhibitionâ€™. It is presumed that the report of that meeting has by now been accepted by the Governments concerned and that the proposal to hold an exhibition in Colombo in February 1952 of resources, products and cultures of each country would be agreed to in principle.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Ceylon Government as convenors of the Exhibition would like very much to invite His Majesty King George VI, who is expected to be in Ceylon for a few days in February 1952 to open the Exhibition formally and it is hoped that other Governments will agree. Subject to this arrangement the Exhibition can then commence about February 12th, 1952, and run for about 2 weeks. The Exhibition may comprise the following sections with special reference to the economic development of South and South-East Asia as envisaged by the Colombo Plan: Agricultural, Industrial, Social, including public health etc. and Cultural including arts, music and dancing etc. Participating Governments may suggest the inclusion of other sections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ceylon Government would be happy to make available without charge all ground space required for National Pavilions, as well as artificial lighting for Pavilions and for the Exhibition as a whole. In regard to other obligations of participants, it is suggested that Articles XV to XXVI of the Convention of 1928 relating to International Exhibitions should be adopted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards organisational arrangements, the Ceylon Government is setting up a small Committee of 3 Cabinet Ministers to undertake on its behalf the planning and organisation of the Exhibition. This Committee will be assisted by an Executive Secretariat, at the head of which will be a senior administrative officer as commissioner. As part of this machinery there will be various panels to deal with various organisational aspects of the Exhibition and the Chairman of each of these panels will form an Advisory Committee to the Commissioner of the Exhibition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure effective co-ordination at the international level, it is suggested that the representatives in Ceylon of participating countries should form a special liaison Committee and it is hoped that countries not represented in Ceylon will assign a special officer to Ceylon for the purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of Ceylon is most anxious that the Exhibition should be fully representative of all countries within the region of South and South-East Asia, as well as of those outside which are members of the Consultative Committee. It is our earnest hope, therefore, that all these countries will agree to participate and will notify their willingness to do so at a very early date. We should also welcome any comments or suggestions that any Government might wish to make at any time concerning the planning and organisation of the Exhibition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This invitation to participate in the Exhibition is being extended to all countries in South and South-East Asia regardless whether or not these are participating in the Colombo Plan. Ends.</p>
