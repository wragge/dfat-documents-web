I"<p>Cablegram 366 CANBERRA, 13 January 1944</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>POLAND-U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>1. You will recall strong interest expressed in this question in</p>

<p>telegram No. 202 to Dominions Office of 4th August, 1943. [1] We</p>

<p>assume that, with crossing of the 1939 Polish boundary by Soviet</p>

<p>forces, renewed efforts are being made to find a solution to the</p>

<p>Russo-Polish problem. Press reports speak of meetings between Eden</p>

<p>and Polish Prime Minister. [2]</p>

<p>2. We have had no information on this subject and in view of our</p>

<p>responsibilities’ we are concerned at the development of events.</p>

<p>Polish Prime Minister’s statement of 6th January [4] suggests that</p>

<p>rapprochement is unlikely and we do not need to stress grave</p>

<p>embarrassment which would result if an understanding were reached</p>

<p>between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States</p>

<p>of America as to the future frontiers of Eastern Poland without</p>

<p>the knowledge of the Australian Government.</p>

<p>3. Please represent to Eden our urgent wish to be kept fully</p>

<p>informed of all stages of present discussions.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 On file AA:A989, 43/715/5/2, i.</p>

<p>2 Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.</p>

<p>3 i.e. Australian representation of Polish interests in the Soviet</p>

<p>Union.</p>

<p>4 Probably a reference to the Polish Prime Minister’s speech of 5</p>

<p>January, on file AA:A989, 44/715/5/2, ii.</p>
