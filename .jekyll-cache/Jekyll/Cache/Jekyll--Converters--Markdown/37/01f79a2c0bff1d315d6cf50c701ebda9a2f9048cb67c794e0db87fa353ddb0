I"•<p>Cablegram unnumbered 6 December 1939,</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Am asking Dominions Office to obtain permission from Washington for me to announce that early in New Year you will be appointed Minister to Washington.</p>

<p>Greatly appreciate your cable [1] and your willingness to serve wherever needed but on full reflection and discussion consider that you are out-standing for Washington post to which I attach enormous importance.</p>

<p>Have discussed it with Maie [2] who I think agrees.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
