<p><em>Mr Whitlam</em> said he had been very discreet at lunch earlier that day when Mr McEwen had forecast doom and disaster for the Australian agricultural industry if permanent special arrangements were not made for it. It was natural for the Country Party to make the loudest possible complaint, but its importance should not be exaggerated. He wished to give Mr Rippon a firm undertaking that the Australian Labour Party would never do anything to impede British entry into the Community. If he himself were British he would want to join. He was certain that Britain would be stronger in than out and could contribute more to the stability and well being of the Western world. <em>Mr Rippon</em> said that Britain must be strong to be of any use to anyone. We judged membership of the Community to be a paramount British interest and hoped, although we did not always say out loud, that we would be able to influence the Community. And in particular those of its policies with which we did not entirely agree, in a more liberal and outward looking direction.</p>
