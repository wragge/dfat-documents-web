<p>In considering E.C.A.F.E. relations with S.C.A.P. I propose suggesting in committee the E.C.A.F.E., in co-operation with the Government concerned, consider plans for developing industry in the whole area so as to avoid continuance of the ill-balanced pre- war economy with Japanese domination of the market, which is unavoidable otherwise. Would appreciate your urgent comments.</p>
