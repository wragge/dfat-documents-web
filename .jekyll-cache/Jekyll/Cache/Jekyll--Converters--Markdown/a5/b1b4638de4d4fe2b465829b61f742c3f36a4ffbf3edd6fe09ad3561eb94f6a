<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Timor. I understand Dominions Office are shortly telegraphing to United Kingdom High Commissioner, Canberra [1], with regard to representations on behalf of Commonwealth to Portuguese Government concerning Timor to which Portuguese Government have not yet replied despite a recent reminder. They are also mentioning the rumour that Japanese are trying to do a deal with Portugal under which in return for Japanâ€™s guaranteeing Macao, the Portuguese would adhere to the Anti-Comintern Pact, recognise Manchukuo and grant Japan air base in Timor. It seems improbable that Portugal would grant air base and I understand Foreign Office have heard nothing about any such suggestion from the Dutch. I am mentioning the matter as Dominions Office telegram is not yet finalised and its contents may take a little while to reach you.</p>
