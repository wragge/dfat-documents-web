<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegrams 206 [1] and 208 [2]-Mandates.</p>

<p>Although in paragraph 4 of your 206, it is stated that Secretary of State said at Dominions Office Meeting he had formed conclusion that Australian proposal was best and recommended its acceptance, we must point out that draft United Kingdom Resolution, set out in your 208, differs from declaration proposed in paragraph 3 of our 139 [3] to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. In particular, the following is omitted:</p>

<p>â€˜We do not regard the dissolution of the League as lessening the obligations imposed on us by the mandate which we regard as of full force and effect.â€™</p>

<p>After discussion with the Minister, we feel we must maintain views expressed in paragraph 3 of our 139.</p>
