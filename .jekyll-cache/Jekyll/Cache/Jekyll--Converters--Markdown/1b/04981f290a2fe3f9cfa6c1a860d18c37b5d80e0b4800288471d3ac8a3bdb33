I"Í<p>Cablegram UN254 NEW YORK, 12 March 1947, 7.27 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Security 300.</p>

<p>1. When the Council resumed debate on Japanese mandates today it had before it a cablegram from New Zealand requesting- (a) New Zealand participation in discussions, and (b) Participation by Netherlands, Canada, India and Philippines if they so desire.</p>

<p>As a result of our further discussions with Mudaliar [1], the Indian Liaison Officer at United Nations Headquarters also presented a letter requesting Indian participation.</p>

<p>2. The United States freely assented to New Zealand and Indian participation although declaring that it did not assent to the reason stated by New Zealand, namely â€˜that disposition made for these islands is an essential part of any plan for the control of Japan and the peace settlement with that countryâ€™ and was, therefore, â€˜a matter of interest to those states who took an active part in the war against Japanâ€™. While denying that other states named were necessarily interested, the United States stated that if they requested to be heard within a reasonable time it would join in inviting them.</p>

<p>3. Australia briefly supported the United States proposal to invite New Zealand and India and expressed concurrence with the view that if others applied they should also be invited.</p>

<p>4. The Council agreed to invite New Zealand and India and expressed willingness to admit other states if they apply and instructed secretariat to ask Governments to send duly accredited representatives.</p>

<p>5. The President [2] then proposed adjournment. We formally lodged the Australian amendments [3] and United Kingdom lodged the amendments given in our Security 302. The President refused to allow any further discussion.</p>

<p>6. The debate will be resumed next Monday.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Sir A. Ramaswami Mudaliar, President of the UN Economic and Social Council.</p>
