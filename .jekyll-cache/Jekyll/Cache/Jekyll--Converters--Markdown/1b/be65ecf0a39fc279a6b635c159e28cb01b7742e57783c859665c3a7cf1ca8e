<p>SECRET</p>

<p>I have your personal telegram [1] and the matter received my immediate consideration.</p>

<p>No crews available for Dutch ships owing to Indonesian seamen‚Äôs strike. Dutch ship VAN SPEZAAK fully loaded with mercy cargo ready for sailing since 24th September is still in Sydney Harbour.</p>

<p>To overcome deadlock suggest you convey to Lieut. General Van Mook desirability of chartering Dutch ships to Australian Government to ensure early despatch all ships carrying mercy cargo.</p>
