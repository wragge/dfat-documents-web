I"	<p>Circular cablegram D18 LONDON, 12 January 1940, 10.55 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister, begins:-</p>

<p>Consideration has recently been given to the desirability of</p>

<p>issuing, on some suitable occasion, a joint Anglo-French</p>

<p>declaration engaging not to conclude a separate Peace. It has been</p>

<p>[ascertained] [1] that the French Government are in favour of this</p>

<p>proposal which it is thought would be of value primarily from a</p>

<p>psychological point of view and for countering German propaganda</p>

<p>designed to drive a wedge between the Allies.</p>

<p>2. A draft declaration has been prepared in the following form:-</p>

<p>‘The undersigned duly authorised thereto by their respective</p>

<p>Governments declare as follows:-</p>

<p>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern</p>

<p>Ireland and the Government of the French Republic mutually</p>

<p>undertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate</p>

<p>nor conclude an armistice or Treaty of Peace except by mutual</p>

<p>agreement.’</p>

<p>3. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be glad to</p>

<p>learn whether His Majesty’s Government in the Commonwealth of</p>

<p>Australia would wish to be associated with such a declaration. In</p>

<p>that event it is suggested that the following wording should be</p>

<p>substituted at the beginning of the second Sentence:-</p>

<p>‘The Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, the Commonwealth</p>

<p>of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa and the</p>

<p>Government of the French Republic.’</p>

<p>4. It will be observed that the draft set out in paragraph two</p>

<p>above does not exclude the possibility of separate agreements</p>

<p>being concluded by each of Dominion Governments but it is</p>

<p>unnecessary to emphasise the enhanced effect of the solidarity</p>

<p>which would result from joint signature by five of His Majesty’s</p>

<p>Governments.</p>

<p>5. The Government of India are being consulted as to whether they</p>

<p>would wish to be included.</p>
