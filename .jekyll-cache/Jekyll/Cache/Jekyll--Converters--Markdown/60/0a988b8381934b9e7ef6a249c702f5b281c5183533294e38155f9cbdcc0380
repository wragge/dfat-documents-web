<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram No.37 [1] and your 34. [2] Portuguese Timor. We still think it of the utmost importance that General Wavellâ€™s [3] opinion should be sought, as he and not our Chiefs of Staff is responsible for the area which includes Portuguese Timor. We would urge that steps be taken at once to obtain his advice.</p>

<p>We would mention that General Wavell has sent an enquiry [4] to our Chiefs of Staff on this subject and they have forwarded a brief reply [5] indicating that it is proposed to withdraw Allied forces from Portuguese Timor upon arrival of 700 Portuguese troops and suggesting that full information be obtained by him from London.</p>
