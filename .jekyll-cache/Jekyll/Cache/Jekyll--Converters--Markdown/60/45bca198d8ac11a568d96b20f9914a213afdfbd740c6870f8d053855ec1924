<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 102.</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Our general attitude on sending KIRBY to N.E.I. was made clear during OFFICER’S farewell interview with STIKKER 8th October although reference was not made on that occasion to probable condition of lifting of blockade.</p>

<p>2. In view of U.S. action you describe, assume no move on our part should for the present be made to mention to Ministry of Foreign Affairs probable conditions attaching to KIRBY’S availability. If Dutch should make further approach (see our telegram No. 142 [1]) are we authorized specifically to mention conditions? 3. Quinn returning U.N. delegation today. [2]</p>

<p>2 In Cablegram 104, dispatched on 12 October, the Department of External Affairs advised Landale that it was placing responsibility on the United States for the success of the negotiations, that the position had been put to Teppema, and that there was no need for him to take any further action for the moment.</p>
