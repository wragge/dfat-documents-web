<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>If you have not already replied regarding attendance Asian Conference glad of immediate comment.</p>

<p>Prime Ministerâ€™s reaction at the moment favourable but awaiting your comment.</p>

<p>Invitation now received and made public and the United Kingdom already suggesting we should not accept without consultation with them. This is a regional matter of vital importance to us and the United Kingdom has failed to appreciate our primary concern and to give support. It seems to me we must attend looked at from any point of view.</p>
