I"Ú<p>Cablegram 13 8 September 1940,</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>My No. 11. [1]</p>

<p>In response to suggestion from United Kingdom Government we have agreed to dispatch of H.M.A.S. Adelaide to Vila, with date of arrival September 7, having in mind possibility that local situation in New Caledonia might necessitate dispatch of vessel to Noumea. United Kingdom Government now propose that Adelaide should escort Sautot [2] to Noumea with commission as Governor from de Gaulle. [3] Please telegraph immediately your views on this proposal along with any information you have about movements of Dumont dâ€™Urville. Commission to Sautot is ready in draft and we have been asked to express our views urgently to London. Texts of United Kingdom messages referred to are being dispatched tomorrow.</p>
