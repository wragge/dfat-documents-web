<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>For Evatt from Glasgow.</p>

<p>Your telegram 31. [1] Mutual Aid General Agreement.</p>

<p>Canadians have now agreed to amend article 10 by substituting for the words â€˜the expansion of International commerce by the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriersâ€™ the words â€˜the expansion of commerce through appropriate international agreements on commercial policyâ€™. The agreements, including the article in this amended form, were signed in Ottawa yesterday with the United Kingdom and Soviet Governments. I understand that Davis has been instructed to inform you of the above, and also of two minor amendments to articles 9(c) and II. [2]</p>

<p>I feel that elimination of reference to tariffs and trade barriers is most satisfactory from our point of view and would strongly recommend that we now meet [Canadian] [3] desire for early signature of agreement. [4]</p>
