<p>2 The Acting High Commissioner in London, J. S. Duncan, subsequently kept in touch with the U.K. Dominions Secretary (Malcolm MacDonald until 28 January, then Sir Thomas Inskip), and reported on meetings in cablegrams to Lyons, no. 23 of 28 January, no 32 of 6 February and no 41 of 17 February 1939 (EA: A2937, European Situation). On 6 February Duncan told Lyons that â€˜Inskip hesitated about being very explicit but appeared to feel that situation was easier and tension somewhat lessenedâ€™, and on 17 February that â€˜situation vis-a-vis Germany is for the present less tenseâ€™.</p>
