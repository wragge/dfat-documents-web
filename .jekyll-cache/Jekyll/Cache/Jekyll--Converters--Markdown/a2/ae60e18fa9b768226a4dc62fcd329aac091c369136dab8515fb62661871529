<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>From Naval Attache [1] for Chief of Naval Staff. [2] TROPIC No. 6.</p>

<p>Various proposals have been put forward by the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations [3] regarding the transfer of portion of the U.S.</p>

<p>Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>2. These proposals vary from the transfer of a force comprising three battleships, four light cruisers, and two squadrons of destroyers-(this force is nearly equal to the force to be transferred after the U.S. enters war, see ABC-1 [4], Annex 3, paragraph 57) to the transfer of a large proportion of the Pacific Fleet.</p>

<p>3. These suggestions are now being examined by the U.K. Chiefs of Staff in the light of the present situation and in relation to certain hypothetical movements of British Naval forces; doubtless you will be consulted before any concurrence is given to the serious weakening of U.S.-British forces in a possible Eastern theatre of war.</p>

<p>4. It has already been decided to move one U.S. aircraft carrier and five destroyers from the Pacific to the Atlantic to replace U.S.S. â€˜Rangerâ€™ who is due for long refit.</p>

<p>5. Although the strategical soundness of some of these proposals is very much open to question, they do at least show a refreshing tendency on the part of the U.S. Naval authorities to get away from the conception of keeping a large fleet based on Hawaii carrying out the half-hearted role of attempting to contain the Japanese fleet by its mere presence. My TROPIC No. 3 [5] â€˜refers.</p>

<p>6. One must assume that the movements envisaged above, together with the plan outlined in my Tropic No. 5 [6] are not only designed to give as much practical aid to us as possible within the limits of present non-belligerency, but will also have the effect of increasing considerably the chances of some incident which might easily hasten the entry of the U.S. into the war.</p>
