I"ð<p>Cablegram K204 BATAVIA, 9 December 1948, 6.45 p.m. Received 10</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Cochran has received instructions that report mentioned in paragraph 6 of K 202 [1] should be detailed as possible and should [include the texts] [2] of Critchley-Dubois plan [3] and Cochran plan. [4] Naturally I shall support him in this.</p>

<p>2. The report will necessarily largely depend on the account given by the parties to the Committee, of the breakdown of the direct talks. The Republicâ€™s report [5] has already been received and the Committee is awaiting the report of the Netherlands Minister who should have reached The Hague today. [6]</p>

<p>3. I returned to Batavia today after two daysâ€™ visit to Djokjakarta and I am convinced that the establishment of the Interim Federal Government without the Republic will result in stiffening of the Republic attitude and in diminution, to vanishing point, of already slight prospects of negotiated settlement. I understand that Cochran has reported to his Government in similar terms.</p>
