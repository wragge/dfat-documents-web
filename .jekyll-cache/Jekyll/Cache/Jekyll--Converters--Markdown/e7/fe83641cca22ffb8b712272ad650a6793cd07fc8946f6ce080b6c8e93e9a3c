<p>197.Secret</p>

<p>The Tunku did not state categorically in House<a href="#f3">3</a> that â€˜deadlineâ€™ for Malaysia was August <em>1962</em> but nevertheless this is his hope. He said Singapore would have to decide on merger by August or he would consider closing causeway.<a href="#f4">4</a> He had said earlier (our telegram 173)<a href="#f5">5</a> that he would go to London <em>before</em> August for â€˜final talksâ€™ on Malaysia and Minister for Transport (Sardon)<a href="#f6">6</a> did say in House on 2nd May â€˜we hope to have Malaysia by 31st Augustâ€™.</p>

<p>2. Malayans take an optimistic view of Borneo developments. They have always tended to assume that the Cobbold report will be favourable and although constitutional changes may take some time that they will be in a position to proclaim Malaysia on Merdeka Day.<a href="#f7">7</a></p>

<p>3. Tunkuâ€™s statement reflects continuing Malayan anxiety about Singapore. There is an increasing tendency to consider that the threat of Communist subversion must be dealt with firmly as a precondition for merger. At the weekend Razak<a href="#f8">8</a> told me that with the Cobbold Commissionâ€™s report on the way, the proposal for incorporating the Borneo territories had gained a momentum that would be difficult to stop. He thought that this progress need not be influenced by delay over Singapore.</p>
