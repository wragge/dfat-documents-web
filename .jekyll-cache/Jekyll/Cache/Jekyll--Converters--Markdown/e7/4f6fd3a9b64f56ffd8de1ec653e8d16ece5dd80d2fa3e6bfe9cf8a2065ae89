<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>For the Prime Minister. Russia.</p>

<p>Question of position of Dominions in the event of negotiations between United Kingdom and Russia for treaty being successfully concluded has been receiving some consideration.</p>

<p>Position as I see it is as follows:</p>

<p>It would be acceptable to Russia that Dominions should be parties as well as United Kingdom, but most improbable that Canada or South Africa would be willing.</p>

<p>It would be admirable if agreement acceptable to all Dominions could be arrived at and embodied in a treaty to which they were parties. It would, however, be undesirable that some Dominions should be parties, as this would be interpreted as indicating a divergence of the attitude towards Russia in the British Empire.</p>

<p>As unanimity almost certainly unobtainable wisest course would seem for treaty to be solely between United Kingdom and U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>In such case unless declaration made by any Dominion to the contrary, which unlikely, general assumption would be that Dominions were in accord with what had been done.</p>

<p>I shall be obliged if you will let me have your views. [1]</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>1 On 26 April the External Affairs Dept replied that since the treaty affected European reconstruction and frontiers it was primarily a matter for the U.K. Govt and that the arguments advanced by Bruce against formal participation by the Dominions were accepted.
