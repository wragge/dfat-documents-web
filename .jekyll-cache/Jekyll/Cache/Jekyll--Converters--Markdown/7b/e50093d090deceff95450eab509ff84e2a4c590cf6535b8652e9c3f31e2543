<p>The document I handed to the Chinese Ambassador last Thursday had been returned in the mail this morning with the following cover. Beginsâ€”</p>

<p>Mr Ambassador, because of the fact that the document, which you handed over on March 23 1972, wrongly names the Taiwan province of our country, hereby we have but to turn ( <em>sic</em> ) it to you.</p>

<p>The Embassy of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China to the Republic of France. Ends.</p>
