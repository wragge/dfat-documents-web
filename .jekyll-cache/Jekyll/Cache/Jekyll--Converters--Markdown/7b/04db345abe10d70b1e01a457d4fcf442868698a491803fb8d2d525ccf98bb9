<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Your 438 and 444.[1]</p>

<p>1. It would seem undesirable for Interim Committee to which several member states have not appointed representatives to make recommendations as to its own continuance.</p>

<p>2. It might be useful if at next session of Assembly President were authorised to consult with member states not represented on Committee to see whether agreement is possible on re-constituted committee which would (a) serve as a Standing Committee of the Whole with time-saving functions in connection with the preparation of the agenda of regular session;</p>

<p>(b) carry out non-contentious assignments allotted by General Assembly;</p>

<p>(c) deal definitively with international conventions of a political character.</p>

<p>3. If Committee is nevertheless determined to make recommendation on question of continuance please explore these views informally and report reaction.[2]</p>

<p>_[1] Cablegram UN444, dispatched 4 August 1949, sought comments upon the continuation of the Committee.</p>

<p>[2] The delegation reported that it found considerable support for the views when it put them forward in committee on 10 August 1949.</p>
