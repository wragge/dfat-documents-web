I"’<p>Cablegram 6 (extract) WASHINGTON, 5 January 1940, 11.17 p.m.</p>

<p>Information: Legation will of course be devoid of all information</p>

<p>except from sources one has opened up and the press unless some</p>

<p>arrangement is made with the Embassy. [1] Suggest I arrange to</p>

<p>continue to have access to press reports done by the British</p>

<p>Library of Information in New York and various consular reports on</p>

<p>which to a large extent my present information is based. As</p>

<p>regards information on the outside world, the Minister will, of</p>

<p>course, be making his own arrangements as regards Australia, but</p>

<p>as regards Europe suggest External Affairs in London be instructed</p>

<p>to send the Minister duplicates of all his information ‚ÄòLon.‚Äô</p>

<p>letters, etc. and that I arrange with the Embassy to have access</p>

<p>to ‚ÄòIntel‚Äô series of weekly political intelligence summaries, etc.</p>

<p>As we will be without any technical advisers, I suggest that the</p>

<p>Foreign Office be asked to allow us access to the three service</p>

<p>Attaches.</p>

<p>These proposals as regards information, etc., are, of course,</p>

<p>requests for facilities neither Canada nor South Africa enjoy, but</p>

<p>in view of our special relations here and in London, I do not</p>

<p>anticipate that the Foreign Office would raise any objection. [2]</p>

<p>2 Hodgson replied: ‚ÄòInformation: Mr. Stirling is being asked to</p>

<p>ascertain Foreign Office‚Äôs attitude as regards access to Service</p>

<p>Attaches at Embassy and also as to possibility of supply of copies</p>

<p>of Foreign Office print. He will be instructed to send duplicates</p>

<p>of his despatches and to repeat his more important telegrams.</p>

<p>Presume that ‚ÄúIntel‚Äù series covers adequate information conveyed</p>

<p>in Dominions Office ‚ÄúIntel‚Äù telegrams. If not, Mr. Stirling could</p>

<p>be asked to supplement. It is proposed that Legation should</p>

<p>receive regular information telegrams from here covering</p>

<p>Australian developments.‚Äô (See cablegram 3 of 9 January 1940 on</p>
