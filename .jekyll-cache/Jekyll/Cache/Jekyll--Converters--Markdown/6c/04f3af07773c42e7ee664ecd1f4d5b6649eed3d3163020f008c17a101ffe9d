<p>Please see our 127 [2] to New York of yesterdayâ€™s date.</p>

<p>As you will see, we recognise that the Security Council may not be able to agree on measures to force the Dutch to comply with the resolution in full and are accordingly prepared if necessary to acknowledge the possible value of a conference on the lines proposed by the Dutch, subject to definite safeguards. In any further talks with the State Department, however, you should emphasize that we would expect United States to take the lead in pressing the Security Council to follow up its resolution [3] to the fullest possible extent.</p>
