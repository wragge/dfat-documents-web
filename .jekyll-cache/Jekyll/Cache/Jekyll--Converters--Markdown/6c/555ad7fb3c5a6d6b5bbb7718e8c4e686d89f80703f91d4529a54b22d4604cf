<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>I had long discussion last night with VREDENBURCH who is here obtaining (I understand) instructions for political discussion with Republic.</p>

<p>2. I endeavoured to urge on him points that KIRBY emphasised here [1]- need to allow Republic fair play and show some confidence in them and in particular that new â€˜puppetâ€™ states should not be created pending the coming plebiscites.</p>

<p>3. Vredenburch was friendly as usual but showed strong hostility to Republic which he described over and over again as tyrannical dictatorship. He was pessimistic about possibility of any political agreement and opposed to an idea of arbitration though he admitted the need for what he termed â€˜the right sortâ€™ of Committee of Good Offices.</p>
