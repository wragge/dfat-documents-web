<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Schermerhorn most confidentially confirmed to United Kingdom Consul-General yesterday that the threat of war has been averted for the present but that it would be foolish to imagine that the crisis is over.</p>

<p>United States Consul-General has communicated to Indonesian Government an aide-memoire dated 28 June urging them to co-operate without delay in immediate formation of interim government. This will probably be a contributory factor in keeping the door open.</p>

<p>Text follows in my immediate following telegram. [1]</p>

<p>Report from Djokjakarta states that working committee of KNIP ratified Soekarnoâ€™s decree whereby he assumed all government powers, and also the formation of a presidential cabinet.</p>
