I"õ	<p>Cablegram K127 [KALIURANG, 5] [1] June 1948</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>In close consultation with us the Americans have now drafted an overall plan for a settlement along the lines of paragraph 3 of my telegram K.124. [2] We intend to seek Belgian approval of plan as soon as possible with the object of submitting it to the parties early in the week.</p>

<p>2. Last night, however, Hatta received a letter from Van Mook in which the latter said that he was disturbed to find differences of opinion between the delegations as to the interpretation of the Renville principles. [3] He therefore invited Hatta to Batavia on June 14th to consult with himself and his colleagues as the best means of furthering a settlement.</p>

<p>3. The Committee received a copy of the invitation together with a request from Van Mook that, in view of the delicate situation, the Committee should do nothing which could disturb the matter.</p>

<p>4. Vredenburch who is behind this latest move is seeking delays.</p>

<p>As I have reported earlier, the Dutch policy appears designed to bring about a breakdown without giving the Committee an opportunity to clarify the position of the parties. The latest move will make it most difficult to obtain Herremansâ€™ agreement for the submission of an overall plan to the parties.</p>

<p>5. Our probable course will be, (a) to press ahead as far as possible as proposed in paragraph 1.</p>

<p>(b) to suggest to Hatta, in view of Van Mookâ€™s implication that talks between the delegations have failed, that (1) he ask the Committee whether it is in a position to assist in negotiations by suggesting a possible settlement, (2) he reply to Van Mook expressing surprise that the latter should suggest bypassing Committee before it has had an opportunity to assist in reaching a settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p>(c) To endeavour to assist the Republic on Russian and Foreign Affairs issues generally on which the Dutch will adopt a tough attitude if Hattaâ€™s reply to Van Mookâ€™s letter is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>6. This week will be crucial and I believe it essential that the Committee now take the initiative and keep it. The possibility of strong Dutch diplomatic action in Washington should not be overlooked.</p>
