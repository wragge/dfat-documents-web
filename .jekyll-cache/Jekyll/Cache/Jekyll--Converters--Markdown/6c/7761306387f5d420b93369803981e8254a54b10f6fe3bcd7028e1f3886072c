<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>In my view seriousness of Norwegian situation and its repercussions cannot be exaggerated as I can see no alternative in face of present position to immediate withdrawal of all Allied forces with exception of those in Narvik area. I need not stress secrecy of above opinion.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
