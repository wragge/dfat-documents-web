<p>4 In Cablegram 4465, dispatched from London on 17 December, Evatt cabled to Burton that: â€˜You should have consulted me about Canberra but it is a very gallant undertaking and we are proud of you. â€˜The reference was to Burtonâ€™s decision to stand for preselection in 1949 as the Australian Labor Party candidate for the federal seat of Canberra. Burton failed to gain preselection for the seat.</p>
