<p>3 Circular cablegram B207 from the Dominions Secretary, dated and received 2 September 1938, not printed, said that Lord Runciman believed that publication of Dr Benes’s proposals (see Document 244, note 2) would have ‘an evil effect’ and the United Kingdom Government had accepted his decision. Lord Runciman was pressing Benes to go ‘to the utmost limits’ to meet Sudeten demands, and had sent two messages to Hitler through the Sudeten Party leader, Konrad Henlein (see Document 248).</p>
