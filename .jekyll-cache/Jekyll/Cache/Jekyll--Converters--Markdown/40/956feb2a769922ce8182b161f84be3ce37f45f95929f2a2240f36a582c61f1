<p>1. Monckton [2] and his colleagues had Dominion representatives in Moscow at an informal gathering last evening when he gave us copies of telegrams D.364 [3], 1050 [4], 1051 and 1052 [5] and arranged that we should be kept posted with developments of the Reparations Commission while in Moscow.</p>

<p>2. The first meeting of the Commission took place yesterday. Apart from setting up a Steering Committee consisting of two British, two American and two Russian representatives it only discussed generalities during which the Soviet indicated- (a) Germany should not be allowed to retain chemical industries or have scientific research;</p>

<p>(b) Standard of living of Germany should not be better than mid- European;</p>

<p>(c) Soviet claim textile machinery in Germany was more than required and proposed this machinery should come to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics;</p>

<p>(d) Destruction of German metallurgical industries has been such that 75 per cent of German metal workers could be used in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>

<p>3. The Australian Governmentâ€™s views as expressed in your telegram 97 were conveyed by me to Monckton.</p>
