<p>1. We do not think Commission should, in any event withdraw.</p>

<p>2. First attempt should be to postpone elections until the conditions referred to in our 92[2] paragraph 2 are fulfilled.</p>

<p>3. If authorities will not agree with postponement, commission should observe the circumstances of elections and report to the Assembly.</p>

<p>4. It should, at the outset, make it clear that the elections would be held against its advice and its continued presence in Korea is to give the Assembly a full report of the circumstances, i.e. factual confirmation of the Commissionâ€™s opinion advising against conduct of elections under conditions then existing.</p>

<p>5. Inform your colleagues that in this matter members of the Commission should be free to report separately and jointly to the Assembly, or, as a minimum requirement, that a majority report should be accompanied by a minority report if there is no agreement.</p>

<p>6. The United States authorities in Korea should be informed of the Commissionâ€™s decisions in this respect.</p>
