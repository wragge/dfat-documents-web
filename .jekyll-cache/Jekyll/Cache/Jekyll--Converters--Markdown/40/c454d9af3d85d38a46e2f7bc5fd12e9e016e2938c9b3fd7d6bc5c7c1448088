<p>The position with regard to Palestine is in my judgment the most critical in the history of the United Nations. The choice now is between a complete washout and a positive solution. In such a situation abstention can only mean a direct invitation to the two groups in Palestine to fight it out on the battlefield with the United Nations, which is supposed to maintain peace, not even offering a just solution. I therefore beg you both to put this position most urgently before President Aranha, to whom I send my deepest regards. The situation turns on the votes of Latin American countries over whom he has a wide and justly deserved influence. It is contrary to the self-respect of any nation to evade such an issue and I earnestly request the President to intervene in the way he deems best to produce a result with justice to all the parties and the future interests of United Nations. In the ad hoc committee I struggled for two months so that the delegates would finally face up to the issue on the vote and it would destroy all this work, losing [2] the enormous cost of time and energy [spent] on Palestine. Assembly itself [would lose] in prestige if as a result of all this nothing positive was achieved. Indeed it would reduce the high status of the Assembly to the discredited status now occupied by the Security Council.</p>

<p>To you both and all the Secretariat and especially to President Aranha, who worked so hard to make the Assembly a success, I send my greetings and felicitations. I believe the joint efforts of us all have made a success of the present Assembly but that it is necessary to come to a positive decision on Palestine.</p>
