I"ñ<p>Cablegram P290 CANBERRA, 23 December 1948</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>We have not received your report [1] but it is disturbing to find from the press an adjournment without a vote taken. You will recall that, when we raised the matter originally, the aim was to call for a vote without debate on the question of cease-fire, and, when Council meets again, you should move closure and insist on immediate vote. Ministerâ€™s telegram of 20th [2] has just been received and, in relation to this, see last sentence of paragraph 5.</p>

<p>1 i.e. Hodgsonâ€™s report on the Security Council discussion on Indonesia in Paris on 22 December (see Document 437). 2 Document 393.</p>
