<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Michiels, Netherlands Ambassador in London, told Commissioner General [1] during his passage through Singapore that he was joining the Netherlands Prime Minister in Batavia to advise primarily on external repercussions of extremist Dutch action in Indonesia.</p>

<p>He made no secret of his dislike for the assignment.</p>

<p>2. In conversation with Governor of Singapore [2] with whom he sought interview to ask advice Michiels went further and said he expected to play a decisive part in the establishment of new Indonesian regime. Gimson gathered that he and not Drees would be most responsible figure in this regard. Michielsâ€™ own idea is to set up Interim Federal Government and ask for Shahrir to join it.</p>
