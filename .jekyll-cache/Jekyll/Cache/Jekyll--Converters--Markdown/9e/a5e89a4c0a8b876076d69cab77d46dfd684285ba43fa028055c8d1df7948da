I"^<p>Cablegram 461 [1] CANBERRA, 21 July 1941</p>

<p>Your telegram 445 Lease-Lend. [2]</p>

<p>We are pressing on with organisation for dealing with acquisition</p>

<p>of goods under Lease-Lend. Following is present position in</p>

<p>relation to requirements listed in your paragraph 3. (a) Generally</p>

<p>speaking through import licensing civil imports from United States</p>

<p>of America have been limited to essentials. No relaxation of</p>

<p>standards of what is essential will be permitted but rather the</p>

<p>procedure of progressively intensifying restrictions will be</p>

<p>continued.</p>

<p>(b) (1) Instructions have been issued to all Commonwealth</p>

<p>Government Departments to place all orders for goods from United</p>

<p>States of America with Australian Section of British Purchasing</p>

<p>Commission, New York. This applies also to orders which previously</p>

<p>have been placed through the United Kingdom Ministry of Supply.</p>

<p>(2) List of Service requirements for 1941/42 will shortly be</p>

<p>cabled to New York. These will be followed by necessary detailed</p>

<p>specifications etc. as soon as possible.</p>

<p>(3) Lease-Lend Clearing House for non-warlike goods is being set</p>

<p>up on the basis of the existing import licensing organisation. All</p>

<p>private orders for goods listed which are approved by Clearing</p>

<p>House will be placed with Australian Section British Purchasing</p>

<p>Commission as Government orders for procurement under Lease-Lend</p>

<p>if possible.</p>

<p>(4) Clearing House organisation will not be operating effectively</p>

<p>for few weeks.</p>

<p>(5) Clearing House will (in collaboration, where necessary, with</p>

<p>appropriate Department) attempt to obtain consolidated orders for</p>

<p>goods listed in your paragraph 5 and also for other machinery,</p>

<p>railway, docks and harbour equipment, telephonic and</p>

<p>communications equipment, and civil aircraft as advised by</p>

<p>Australian Minister in Washington. [3]</p>

<p>(c) No further Government orders for goods in classes referred to</p>

<p>will be placed privately in United States of America. Non-</p>

<p>Government orders will be centralised once the Clearing House is</p>

<p>operating.</p>

<p>(d) In distributing goods outside Government departments we cannot</p>

<p>see any satisfactory alternative to charging on the basis of</p>

<p>estimated cost including incidental cash charges which may be</p>

<p>incurred in respect of Lease-Lend goods. Proceeds of sales would</p>

<p>be used-</p>

<p>(i) in case of sales to Government contractors to be set against</p>

<p>gross cost to Department concerned;</p>

<p>(ii) in other cases to be used for war expenditure.</p>

<p>We are satisfied that only by this means can adequate control and</p>

<p>economy be secured. Should it be necessary for private interests</p>

<p>to act as agents for government in distributing goods they will</p>

<p>not be permitted to make profits. Any remuneration will be on</p>

<p>basis of commission or direct payment for services.</p>

<p>We will advise as early as possible on further developments.</p>
