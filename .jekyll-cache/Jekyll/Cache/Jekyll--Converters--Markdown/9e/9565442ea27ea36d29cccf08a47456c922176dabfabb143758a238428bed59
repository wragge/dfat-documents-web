I"Â<p>Cablegram 63 LONDON, 24 January 1940</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>As a result of French representations (Dominions Office D.37) [1] action against Narvik shipments further examined by War Cabinet today and proposal for laying mine fields in Norwegian territorial waters considered.</p>

<p>In my view there is an absence of clear thinking as to objectives and consequences of contemplated action.</p>

<p>I have accordingly urged United Kingdom Government that it is unreasonable to ask for concurrence of Dominions in action which might have the most far-reaching consequences unless they have been fully informed of grounds which led to decision, of possible consequences that may result, and of steps that could be taken to meet them.</p>

<p>Endeavouring to arrange meeting tomorrow with Prime Minister [2] and Halifax. [3] I am hopeful that as a result of such meeting full information down the lines indicated above will be cabled for your comment before final decision taken by War Cabinet. [4]</p>

It reported the opinion of the French Govt that â€˜on the grounds of moral effect, particularly among the neutrals, the blockade of Narvik and the appointment of vessels to Petsamo should be carried out with a minimum delayâ€™.</p>
