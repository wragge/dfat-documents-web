<p>MOST SECRET FOR PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram. [1] On arrival Henderson [2] in conference with the Prime Minister [3] and Halifax [4] over three hours. Subsequently Cabinet sat till nine p.m. and then adjourned till tomorrow Sunday morning. Proposed that Henderson should return with reply tomorrow afternoon. I gather Cabinet discussions fairly satisfactory to Prime Minister’s working for reply on broad and liberal lines but some members difficult. As indicated in my previous cable I consider vital that reply down such lines and if you concur I would strongly urge that you should cable in time for Cabinet tomorrow your views as they would carry great weight and would strengthen the Prime Minister’s hand.</p>
