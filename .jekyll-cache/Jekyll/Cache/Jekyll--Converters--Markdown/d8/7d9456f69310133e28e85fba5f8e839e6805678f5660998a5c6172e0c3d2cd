I":<p>Cablegram 83, CANBERRA, 3 April 1948</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram today H102. Palestine.</p>

<p>1. It is in our view quite wrong to assert that question of fighting was not considered by Committee and by Assembly. It was at all times fully in mind and scheme finally adopted was based on careful consideration of all facts including in particular need for one which would avoid conflict.</p>

<p>2. In our view scheme could have been implemented peacefully had all members of Assembly faithfully adhered to Assembly decision and it seemed to us that it was only as a result of what were regarded by them as signs of weakness in support of decision that Arabs took steps to oppose it.</p>

<p>3. Your telegram under reference is quite contrary to our knowledge of the proceedings of the Assembly and its Committees dealing with this subject. All aspects were fully considered and we do not consider that the Special Assembly should be asked to reconsider the decision of the Assembly on such grounds as you give.</p>
