I"Ð	<p>Australia House, London, 23 March 1962</p>

<p>You will recall that in our discussions on Wednesday I stressed my concern about some aspects of the draft paper on cereals which has been referred to the Australian Government for comment.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>While I value the expressed recognition in the paper of the special problems presented by Australian soft wheat, I explained that I was seriously concerned at my inability to get a clear understanding of what was meant by some of the phrases in the draft paper which are inexplicit and capable of several alternative interpretations.</p>

<p>For instance, I sought a clear definition of what is intended by â€˜conditions (as regards the levy system) which would assure comparably competitive conditions of accessâ€™; and again, what is intended by the proposal that wheat arrangements in the transitional period â€˜should not operate in such a way as to prejudice Australiaâ€™s opportunity to sell traditional quantities on fair competitive terms.â€™</p>

<p>Even at the conclusion of our talks I did not have an understanding of what such phrases as those referred to above really meant for us in terms of what your Delegation has in mind as to the quantity of wheat we could expect to sell, over what period of time and on what kind of price determination.</p>

<p>It would come as a surprise to me if the British Delegation, before it were to submit proposals of the type embodied in the Cereals paper, did not have clearly in mind what such proposals would mean for Australia.</p>

<p>I would be reluctant to believe that for any reason the British Government would not be prepared to reveal its thoughts to me fully on a matter which, as I explained, is of great significance to us in terms of both trade and political importance.</p>

<p>My inability to obtain the degree of clarification about the Cereals paper which I think is essential is among the foremost reasons why I am most anxious to see you on April 13 upon my return from the Continent. I would certainly hope that you would feel able at that time to provide a detailed analysis of British thinking and of what the British Government is aiming to secure for Australia in terms of quantity, period and the basis of prices.</p>

<p>As I made quite clear to you, any figures you may give me in elucidating your thinking you may be sure will never be interpreted by me as a firm promise on your part to achieve these figures.</p>
