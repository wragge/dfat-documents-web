I"š<p>Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 4 August 1938, 5.11 p.m.</p>

<p>Reference Dominions Office cable Circular No. B.185. [1] Proposed statement by United Kingdom representative is in entire agreement with statement made on behalf of Australia at Assembly of League in 1936 and with policy agreed to at the Imperial Conference 1937.</p>

<p>In these circumstances presumably Australia will approve British proposals and I will be instructed to support them at the meeting of Assembly. If you agree I suggest a cable to this effect should be sent to British Government as soon as possible.</p>
