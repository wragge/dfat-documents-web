<p>Portuguese Timor: Humanitarian Concerns</p>

<p>Following represents Departmental views only.</p>

<ol>
  <li>With evacuation of Portuguese and others possibly to be completed today 24 August we expect attention to shift to security and humanitarian situations on Portuguese Timor. Governorâ€™s accounts of the deteriorating situation and appeals for help have been prominently reported and Portuguese Foreign Ministerâ€™s letter handed to UN Secretary-General23 August refers to Portugalâ€™s appeal to Indonesia and Australia â€˜asking for their support and assistance in the humanitarian tasks which must receive primary emphasis under the present circumstancesâ€™.</li>
  <li>We think that plight of local population will be in Ministersâ€™ minds.</li>
  <li>As with evacuation, while not giving the Indonesians a veto on what we do we should want to approach this question in consultation with them (though not on basis which takes further the process, implicit in the Portuguese Foreign Ministerâ€™s letter, of establishing us as a party principal).</li>
  <li>We are also of course aware that possibilities referred to in the last paragraph of your O.JA1399<a href="#f1">1</a> are relevant to relief operations.</li>
  <li>It occurs to us that visit of Pasquier of ICRC to Jakarta expected for tomorrow may give some scope for useful discussion. In particular we would like to know his reaction to suggestion that, despite its earlier rejection of Portuguese evacuation request, ICRC might organise, administer, or at very least lend its name to a relief operation through which national contributions, both governmental and non-governmental, could be made if practical difficulties of giving of effective assistance in the Timor situation could be overcome.</li>
  <li>We would also like you to discuss Pasquierâ€™s visit with Indonesians, and try to establish their reaction to a proposition on lines of preceding paragraph.<a href="#f2">2</a></li>
  <li>Foregoing is exploratory only, and in particular question of available funds, which are as you know very tight, has not yet been discussed with ADAA or Treasury.<a href="#f3">3</a></li>
</ol>

  <li>1 24 August. The last paragraph conceded that pressures on Indonesia to intervene in Portuguese Timor were growing, although there was general agreement that Indonesia would not move without a Portuguese invitation. See also note 1 to Document 182.</li>
  <li>2 Cablegram CH258808 (25 August) corrected the foregoing information. Pasquier was proceeding directly to Darwin on 27 August. Cablegram GE13662 (25 August) reported that the ICRC was treating Portugalâ€™s request with caution, as previous requests for Angola and Mozambique had been considered exaggerated and alarmist. One possibility was that the Australian Red Cross would be asked to assist with inspections and/or medical supplies and personnel.</li>
  <li>3 On 25 August Matias informed DFA that Pires had requested Lisbon to make an international appeal for nurses and medical teams, principally to prevent epidemics.Whitlamâ€™s view had been that Australia must make a humanitarian contribution, but the practical implications of the situation on the ground must be considered. Matias had been asked for more information about conditions and interdepartmental discussions were planned for 26 August (Cablegram CH258808, 25 August).</li>
