<p>I am delighted that you will be representing us at the forthcoming discussions on Germany and Austria. The defects of Paris must be remedied and it will mean much hard work for you. Thanks for the information you have sent already. The general Canadian attitude must be supported-our position is similar to theirs and we have equal rights to participate. Will be sending you full instructions very shortly.</p>
