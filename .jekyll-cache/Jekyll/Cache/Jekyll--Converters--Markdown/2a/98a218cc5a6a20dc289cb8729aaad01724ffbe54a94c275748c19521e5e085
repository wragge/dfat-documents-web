<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR CASEY</p>

<p>My telegram Number 32. [1]</p>

<p>Position here is one of confused thinking and apprehension of</p>

<p>American reaction if agreement is made re Burma road. Nevertheless</p>

<p>in my view, in [face] [2] of the Chief[s] of Staff report and the</p>

<p>fact that I gathered that the Prime Minister [3] is now convinced</p>

<p>that war with Japan must be avoided at all costs, there is little</p>

<p>doubt they will do so.</p>
