  <li>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</li>
</ol>

<p>From Critchley.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Committee finished Tuesday in much more cordial and optimistic atmosphere than seemed possible earlier. The Canadian contribution and the more enthusiastic statement by Kennedy made a considerable difference.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The press communiquÃ© has already been cabled in clear and report<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> will be sent by bag.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kennedy took the advantage of final meeting to clarify further the position of the United States of America. He made the following points:</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) The U.S.A. participated fully in discussions of the Committee as a member, not as an observer.</p>

<p>(2) Participation in the Consultative Committee did not involve participation in the Council of Technical Co-operation.</p>

<p>(3) His Government was not too happy about future meetings being held at a Ministerial level. Representation should be determined by the Government concerned in the light of discussions anticipated at the meeting.</p>

<p>(4) Basis of United States membership was that [the]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> committee [be] consultative and advisory, and would have no action of responsibility.</p>

<p>(5) Any United States aid would be bilateral.</p>

<p>(6) The United States intended â€˜to co-ordinate to the greatest extent possible its present and future progress and to take into account information obtained through discussions in the Committee meetingsâ€™.</p>

<p>(7) Meetings of the Committee should be located in Asia.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kennedy went on to say that in his view, the results of the meeting were favourable and he referred in particular to:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) enthusiasm, interest and cordiality among the representatives,</p>

<p>(b) evidence of co-operative efforts and self-help that existed,</p>

<p>(c) promise of considerable aid already made by the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada,</p>

<p>(d) evidence that the programmes were being actively reviewed and already being carried out.</p>
