<p>158. RESTRICTED IMMEDIATE</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>July 1st is the opening day in the period of six years for which Governments in South and South-East Asia prepared the economic programmes which were issued as the Colombo Plan Report.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governments which together issued the report on economic development in South and South-East Asia have already demonstrated the strength and effectiveness of co-operation devoted to and improving the welfare, preserving the freedoms, of mankind. In a way that had not previously been possible, the report brought to the worldâ€™s attention not merely the struggle against economic adversity that has to be constantly waged in Asia, but also the practical plans which the various Governments had themselves made in order to achieve their objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the short time which has elapsed since the Colombo Plan was published many achievements can be recorded on this first day. Governments in the area are steadily pursuing their programmes of development. Other co-operating Governments have defined the practical aid which they can offer. So far as Australia is concerned we shall continuously strive to send needed supplies to the area. You will know what eight and three quarter million pounds has been set aside by Australia as a contribution in the first year and from this six and a half million pounds worth of supplies have already been Offered and accepted as a gift from Australia. The Australian Government, which from the beginning of our discussions was convinced of the great opportunities for mutual help in the interchange of technical advice and assistance has watched with great satisfaction the development of this aspect of the Colombo Plan. We have offered opportunities for about 200 men and women to come as guests of the Australian Government to use our universities and to study techniques on our farms and in our administrative and technical Institutions. The services of a number of Australian experts have already been made available to Governments in the area and plans are being made for help in procuring Scientific and technical equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>July 1st is the beginning and it is a hopeful beginning. I join my colleague Mr. Gaitskell, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, in his messages to you and my other colleagues on the Consultative Committee conveying goodwill and confidence that the six year plans will come to success and that difficulties can be overcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Consultative Committee in whose discussions I am glad to say the United States has decided to participate there lies the opportunity for the future of reaching a fuller understanding of the problems which from time to time confront the participating countries of Asia. It is my hope that, working in harmony with the various organs of the United Nations in South and South-East Asia, the Consultative Committeeâ€™s discussions will provide a framework of ideas in which a growing number of participating countries can consciously direct their respective economic efforts towards common human objectives in that area of the world.</p>
