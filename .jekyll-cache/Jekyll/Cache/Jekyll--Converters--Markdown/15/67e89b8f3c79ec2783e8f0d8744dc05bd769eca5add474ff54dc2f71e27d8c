<p>16. Secret</p>

<p>Your 13.<a href="#f1">1</a> Our 11.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>The Minister<a href="#f3">3</a> replied by letter classified Secret.</p>

<p>Resume follows:â€”</p>

<p>Beginâ€”</p>

<p>1. Recognition is still before Cabinet.</p>

<p>2. For the Ministerâ€™s personal information the trend of discussion is that Canada will recognise and the matter is one of timing.</p>

<p>3. In Pearsonâ€™s own view the date will probably be about the end of March unless conditions change.</p>

<p>4. United States policy will be one factor though <em>not</em> the governing one. Enquiries have been made in Washington and results will be conveyed when received.<a href="#f4">4</a></p>

<p>5. Pearson would be interested to learn the Ministerâ€™s views as to likelihood of early Australian recognition.</p>

<p>6. It would be a happy circumstance if both Governments take the same action about the same time, though Pearson recognises circumstances may prevent this Ends.</p>

<p>Comment:</p>

<p>1. We learn that Pearson may shortly meet Jessup<a href="#f5">5</a> to discuss the subject.</p>

<p>2. Copy of Pearsonâ€™s letter follows next bag via London.</p>

<p>1 Document 13.</p>

<p>2 18 February. Replying to Canberraâ€™s Cablegram 13 (Document 13), it noted that Pearson was currently out of town, and communicated Pearsonâ€™s assurances that he would do his best to ensure a Canadian Cabinet decision on China by â€˜next weekâ€™, after which Spender would be informed.</p>

<p>3 That is, Lester Pearson.</p>

<p>4 On 3 March, Pearson communicated the results of enquiries in Washington. Points made were: that the US Government was not, at present, in a position to act on the recognition question; that Acheson had commented that no decision would be made without full consultation with Congressional Committees; that neither Congressional nor public opinion would be conducive to recognition for some time; that US opinion had been hardened by Pekingâ€™s attitude resulting in recent consular troubles and the withdrawal of US representation; that it was thus improbable that the Administration would act before Novemberâ€™s gubernatorial and midâ€“term Congressional elections; and, finally, that th.e desire to protect the future of the Nationalist Government was influencing the United States.</p>
