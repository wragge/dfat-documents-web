<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Feeling of United Kingdom Authorities now is- (1) That Dutch announcement [1] regarding political leaders is quite unsatisfactory but that- (11) Proposal [2] for earlier transfer of sovereignty, whatever its motives, might be basis for effectuating the Security Council resolution [3] and- (111) Important factor is the view of the United Nations Commission on which no information here as yet.</p>

<p>2. I get the impression that the United Kingdom feel that, provided there were real Indonesian Representation and the United Nations Commission were present, negotiation at The Hague might have better chance of success (in view of nature of present Dutch coalition) than negotiations at Batavia.</p>

<p>3. Unofficial observers here tend to regard Beel proposals as unadmitted surrender by the Dutch.</p>
