<p><strong>Portuguese Timor</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Joseph has shown me the attached last few pages of his draft on Portuguese Timor,<a href="#f1">1</a> which he had rewritten after discussions with Mr Forrester and myself.</p>

<p>I feel bound to point out that I do not agree with the approach outlined, as Mr Joseph knows. In essence, I believe we are already on a path that is</p>

<ol>
  <li>driving FRETILIN into the arms of the extreme left, and perhaps the Chinese</li>
  <li>giving the Indonesians the very excuses they need to intervene in P. Timor to prevent a â€˜communist takeoverâ€™</li>
  <li>and thus leading to an unpleasant period in our relations with Indonesia, with calls for suspension of aid, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not believe we should detach ourselves and do nothing-or wait to be asked to join some Indonesian/Portuguese arrangement that may never materialise.</p>

<p>I believe we need to take an initiative now to offer the Indons. a way out. We must get the idea across that they <em>can</em> live with an independent P. Timor, if we and they take measures to integrate it <em>economically</em> into our region and help make it viable. Its political co-operation would automatically follow.</p>

<p>P.S. I can elaborate further in discussion if you wish.</p>
