I"è<p>Cablegram D87 LONDON, 17 January 1945, 8.52 p.m.</p>

<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>My telegrams 18th December, 1944, D.1827 and 2nd January D.5. [1] Voting in the Security Council.</p>

<p>1. After further consideration here in the light of your reply [2] and those of the other British Commonwealth Governments, His Majestyâ€™s United Kingdom Ambassador at Washington has been instructed to inform the United States Secretary of State that His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to accept the Presidentâ€™s proposed compromise solution.</p>

<p>2. We have added that we are still not entirely clear as to the precise effect of applying to Chapter VIII, Section C, paragraph 1 the rule that parties to a dispute should N 0 T vote but we do not anticipate any difficulty on this score.</p>

<p>3. Lord Halifax has been asked to remind Mr. Stettinius that the question of voting is N O T the only one that remains to be settled before a United Nations Conference could be called, that all the difficulties will N O T probably have been got out of the way before next Three-Power meeting and that therefore he should N O T go ahead precipitately. Moreover the idea was that the invitation to the event[ual] conference should be in the name of three (or four) powers and consequently consultation will be necessary before the invitation is issued.</p>

<p>4. We are considering further the various questions raised in reply to my telegram D. No. 1827. Meanwhile please see the individual replies in my immediately following telegrams. [3]</p>
