<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Noel-Baker and McNeil this afternoon outlined to all High Commissioners the attitude of the United Kingdom to MacNaughtonâ€™s suggestion [1] that â€˜without prejudice to Security Councilâ€™s Resolution [2] on 28th Januaryâ€™ a meeting should be arranged under the United Nations Commission auspices at Batavia between the Republican Leaders and Netherlands Representatives to arrange for the return of Republican leaders to Djokjakarta and their proceeding to The Hague for a round table conference.</p>

<p>2. Australia, India, Pakistan and Ceylon were very critical of various aspects of this proposal, asking how it could possibly be â€˜without prejudiceâ€™ to the 28th January Resolution. Beasley emphasised the importance of the matter to the United Nationsâ€™ authority. There was no reason at all why political prisoners should not have been unconditionally released and other parts of the resolution implemented already.</p>

<p>3. It is clear that though McNeil and Noel-Baker merely said that this Canadian suggestion might make it possible for the Security Council Resolution to be carried out and they knew of no other way in which it might be carried out, that the United Kingdom, unless this afternoonâ€™s meeting has some effect, will support the Canadian proposal. McNeil and Baker were both at pains to emphasise that they thought no round table conference should be contemplated unless the Republicans attended it freely and after their return to Djokjakarta and with full powers from their Government. It also seems clear from an answer to one of Beasleyâ€™s questions that Bevin has already told Stikker, who is in London, that he favours the proposal.</p>

<p>4. The Minister [3] regards the proposal as quite unsatisfactory, emphasising that we should use our influence against anything short of effective implementation of the 28th January Resolution specially in matters which are essential prerequisites of negotiations.</p>
