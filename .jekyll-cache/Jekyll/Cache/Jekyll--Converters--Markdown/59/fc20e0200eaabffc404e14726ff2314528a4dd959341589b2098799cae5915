<p>413. SECRET.</p>

<p>TOKYO</p>

<p>Yesterdayâ€™s Press reported in fairly unequivocal terms that the Government had instructed the Delegation to return before the end of the year in view of wheat stalemate. I checked with Yoshino who said:</p>

<p>1. The Delegation had reported difficulty in sustaining the talks without wheat counter offer.</p>

<p>2. The Delegation had been advised it could return (singly if necessary through Olympic overcrowding of airways [1]) if it thought this desirable, but decision left at the discretion of the Delegation.</p>

<p>I did not think this worth reporting because I felt you would be told the decision by the Delegation. However, since this morningâ€™s press carried a Canberra report dated yesterday that â€˜the Officials of both Nationsâ€™ denied both the reports that the talks had collapsed and that the Delegation was being recalled, I have thought that you should know the background this end.</p>

<p>Yesterdayâ€™s reports could have been part of the anti-Kono campaign currently intensifying.</p>

<p>1 The Olympic Games were held in Melbourne from 22 November to 8 December 1956.</p>
