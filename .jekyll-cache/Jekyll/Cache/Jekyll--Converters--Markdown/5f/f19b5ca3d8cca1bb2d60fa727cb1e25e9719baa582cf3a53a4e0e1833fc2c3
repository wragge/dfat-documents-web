I"j<p>Cablegram 17 11 February 1937,</p>

<p>Your 23. [1]</p>

<p>Appreciate that in many respects it would be of value if Officer [2] remained in London over Conference but in view of announcement made both here and United Kingdom and wide interest aroused in Australia as evidenced many leading articles on our advance in foreign affairs, feel that there should be no undue delay in assuming post. Moreover understand Hood [3] now conversant with London end while Hodgson [4] with complete documentation on all foreign questions is accompanying me.</p>

<p>Announcement has been made that Stirling [5] will take up London appointment and he will most likely arrive London before Conference.</p>

<p>In view of above considerations you may wish to reconsider your telegram No. 23. Glad early reply.</p>

<p>LYONS</p>
