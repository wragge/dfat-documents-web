<p>Lim Yew Hock<a href="#f2">2</a> who is returning to Kuala Lumpur today for consultations had an hour with the Minister yesterday.</p>

<p>2. The Minister reaffirmed Australiaâ€™s military commitment and asked that Malaysia precede any formal request for Australian troops by close and regular consultations with us.</p>

<p>3. In expressing concern that current United States attitudes may be affected by Malaysian responses he urged the Malaysians to choose courses of action which would not afford the Americans any reason to be critical of Malaysia. Malaysia should not be provocative and should be careful to accept and explore any avenues which might lead to settlement.</p>

<p>4. In the Ministerâ€™s view Malaysia was correct to insist on withdrawal of Indonesian troops before agreeing to discussion of a political settlement and should not be drawn to a summit hastily. There should be a series of carefully phased steps beginning with a ministerial meeting agreeing on withdrawal. Provided execution of the cease-fire agreement was put in hand and there was acceptable evidence of intention to proceed with it, the meeting could draw up a clearly defined agenda for a summit. Substantial withdrawal should precede any summit meeting.</p>

<p>5. Lim Yew Hock mentioned the possibility of a summit under U Thantâ€™s chairmanship. The Minister thought that any such idea was fall back position. Malaysians should maintain for as long as possible their present position of avoiding a summit meeting until Indonesian troops have been withdrawn. If the pressure of events forced a retreat from this position the Malaysians might agree to a summit after an agenda and arrangements for withdrawal had been drawn up and to some extent implemented by a ministerial meeting. If this position, in turn, proved untenable a summit without agenda under the Secretary-Generalâ€™s chairmanship could be considered provided that withdrawal had been agreed beforehand and put partially into effect.</p>

<p>6. The Minister told Lim Yew Hock that although Malaysiaâ€™s presentation of its case was good it was essential to concentrate on building up a favourable image at the United Nations.</p>

<p>7. Full record of conversation by safe hand bag.</p>
