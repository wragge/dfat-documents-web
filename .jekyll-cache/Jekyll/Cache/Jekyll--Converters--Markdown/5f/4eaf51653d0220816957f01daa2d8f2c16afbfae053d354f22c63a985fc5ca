<p>SECRET</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Relations Office has approached us on the semi permanent headquarters for E.C.A.F.E. If the matter is raised in the current session of the Economic and Social Council you should support any United Kingdom motion seeking deferment until after the E.C.A.F.E. has made a recommendation.</p>

<p>If this is defeated, support Singapore. [1]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 The matter was not raised until the 3rd session of ECAFE in June 1948 when the Commission decided to retain the temporary headquarters in Shanghai until a permanent site was determined.</p>
