I"Ñ<p>Cablegram 5.39 (extract) LONDON, 9 October 1939, 8.05 p.m.</p>

<p>CLEAR THE LINE MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Draft reply was examined by the War Cabinet this morning but considered unsatisfactory and a sub-committee of the Prime Minister [1], Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [2], Chancellor of the Exchequer [3] and First Lord of the Admiralty [4] are redrafting it. I am expecting available ten tonight and will cable to you immediately. The Prime Minister of Canada [5] sent further cable today suggesting that President of the United States [6], the King of Italy [7] and the King of the Belgians [8] should be asked to formulate a basis for a European settlement.</p>

<p>Not considered likely that consent to act could be obtained particularly from the President of the United States and even if consents could be obtained, proposal not regarded as practical.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
