<p>Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Australia House</strong></p>

<p>I told Sir Keith Waller that I had an hour or so last night with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>He said he was aware of this.</p>

<p>I said it produced no particular outcome. In a way, it could be called a philosophical discussion. But this was not to say that the Minister did not put his views strongly. He did.</p>

<p>I said that for my part, I was trying to find a way through. I had spent a few minutes with the Prime Minister after I left Mr Bowen and I believed there was ground on which they would come together.</p>

<p>Sir Keith said for his part he hoped not. He was not any more interesting himself in it and wanted no part of the exercise.</p>

<p>I said that my interest was to get a solution. The Minister told me that he would give the Prime Ministerâ€™s letter further consideration. He would then be replying either by a letter or orally.</p>

<p>Sir Keith said his understanding is that the Minister will draft a letter and will discuss it in Canberra with him on Monday.</p>
