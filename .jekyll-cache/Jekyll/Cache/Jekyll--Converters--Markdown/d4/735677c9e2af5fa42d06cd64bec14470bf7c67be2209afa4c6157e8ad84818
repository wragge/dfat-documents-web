I"¤<p>Australian High Commission, London, 9 May 1972</p>

<p>7206. Personal And Confidential</p>

<p>I noted carefully the reference in the Foreign Ministerâ€™s Statement concerning the transfer of Australia House to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I think you know my views, but for the official record I wish to state that I disagree with what the Government is doing, and I desire to point out that although I have been the Head of this Mission for a period now approaching eight years, my views have not been solicited on this matter either by the Prime Minister or any member of the Administration at any time, nor have I been consulted.</p>
