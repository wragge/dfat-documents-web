<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>Appreciation of Middle East in Z.168 [1] in my view is mere</p>

<p>statement of obvious facts within the knowledge of any reasonably</p>

<p>competent person. It stresses the importance of our position in</p>

<p>the Middle East and in paragraph 8 shows what that position hinges</p>

<p>on. In subsequent paragraphs it indicates the possibility of our</p>

<p>not being able to maintain our position in various vital areas</p>

<p>referred to in paragraph 2 and in paragraph 9 it states the</p>

<p>necessity of strengthening our forces in the Middle East but</p>

<p>indicates little prospect of its being possible to do this for a</p>

<p>considerable time. It, however, gives no indication of what the</p>

<p>plan would be in the event of our having to retire from any of the</p>

<p>vital points mentioned. For example, paragraph 4 shows that we</p>

<p>have forces in Egypt sufficient only to cope with Italy so long as</p>

<p>we retain a fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. That Alexandria</p>

<p>might be rendered untenable as fleet base if Italy reinforced in</p>

<p>the air by Germany. In the event of these reinforcements being</p>

<p>provided Alexandria becoming untenable and Egypt having to be</p>

<p>evacuated no indication is given as to where it is contemplated</p>

<p>that forces now in Egypt would be withdrawn.</p>

<p>This is only one example but there are many others that will occur</p>

<p>to you.</p>

<p>The present arrangement is that I am to discuss this appreciation</p>

<p>as well as the Far Eastern questions raised in Dominions Office</p>

<p>telegram No. 228 [2] with Chiefs of Staff Committee.</p>

<p>Please send me any specific points you would desire me to raise in</p>

<p>this discussion.</p>
