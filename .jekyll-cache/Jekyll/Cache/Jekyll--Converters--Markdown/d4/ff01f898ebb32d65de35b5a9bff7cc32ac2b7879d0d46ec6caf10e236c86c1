An ABC reporter in Dili Tony Manati says five Australian newsmen are missing in the region. FRETILINâ€™s Secretary for Foreign Affairs Jose Ramos Horta said in Dili last night that Indonesian forces had swept through the town of Balibo, burning it out and decimating the force of fifty FRETILIN soldiers there.</p>
