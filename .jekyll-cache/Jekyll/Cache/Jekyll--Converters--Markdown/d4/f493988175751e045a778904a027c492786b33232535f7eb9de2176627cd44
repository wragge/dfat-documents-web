<p>Possible Visit by Minister for the Army</p>

<p><em>Against</em></p>

<p>1. If the Minister for the Army were in China while Australian troops were still in Vietnam, this could have a bad effect on public opinion and Army morale.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>2. It is impossible for a Minister of the Crown to make such a visit in a private capacity.</p>

<p>3. Mr Peacockâ€™s presence in China during the UN debate would be gravely misâ€“understood by our friends, especially the Japanese. It could make us look ridiculous at a time when we were fighting for the ROC seat and prejudice our efforts.</p>

<p>4. The fact that the Chinese have selected the Minister for the Army must give reason for caution.</p>

<p>5. A Ministerial visit on Chinese terms when we have been rebuffed in Paris and Belgrade might seem undignified.</p>

<p>6. A visit by a Minister unfamiliar with the complex China question would require lengthy briefing.</p>

<p>7. If a Minister makes one false step, it involves the Government in a measure of responsibility, with the possibility of wide adverse publicity.</p>

<p>8. We have been told that visits, Trade Missions etc. must await diplomatic relations. This must throw some doubt on the CRC initiative.</p>

<p>9. In spite of Kibeiâ€™s assurance of courteous treatment, we cannot disregard the possibility of a rebuff.</p>

<p><em>For</em></p>

<p>1. Visit by a Minister would be seen as an important step in our dialogue with Peking.</p>

<p>2. Selection of a junior Minister would be less of a commitment than say a visit by the Foreign Minister.</p>

<p>3. Our policy has been not to rebuff Chinese overtures but rather to encourage them.</p>

<p>4. It may be that the Chinese have decided that since a deadlock has been reached in diplomatic negotiations, they can renew the dialogue without loss of face through a Ministerial visit.</p>

<p><em>Trade Mission</em></p>

<p>We have reviewed the question of a Trade Mission and have concluded that there are no serious dangers or risks involved.</p>

<p>There need be no political gestures or discussions.</p>

<p>We have already suggested a Trade Mission to the Chinese.</p>

<p>Chinese acceptance of such a Mission would serve to confirm Kibelâ€™s statements about a Ministerial visit, should the Government wish to return to this idea.</p>

<p>If the mission succeeds, the Government will have scored a substantial plus.</p>

<p>If it fails, no great harm will have been done as the onus will be clearly on the side of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines, none of whom recognise the PRC, have already sent secret official trade missions.</p>

<p>We therefore recommend:</p>

<p>(a) that Kibel should be told we should like to send a semiâ€“official Trade Mission as soon as possible after the Canton Fair;</p>

<p>(b) that he should be told that there are practical difficulties in a Ministerial visit at this time;</p>

<p>(c) he should be authorised to tell the Chinese that we do not rule out the possibility of a Ministerial visit towards the end of the year.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>
