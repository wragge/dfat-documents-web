<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your 49. [1] Minister is impressed by your two messages.</p>

<p>He feels in first instance you might act on his behalf as President of United Nations Assembly and make contact and seek informal consultation with parties concerned. There is apparently no other intermediary able and willing to act. Minister is communicating with Secretary-General so that if your informal approach suggests further action would be useful Secretary-General might join Minister so saving lives of many innocent people. Offer of good offices in such circumstances is right and duty of every President who can contribute to a settlement in whole or in part.</p>
