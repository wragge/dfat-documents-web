<p><strong>Indonesian Infiltrations into Malaya</strong></p>

<p>I attach a copy of telegram 868 from Kuala Lumpur which refers to news of landings early this morning near Pontian in western Johore and also to possible landings on the east coast of Johore.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>2. We have had indications for several weeks now of Indonesian intentions to infiltrate into Malaya members<a href="#f3">3</a> of Malays and Chinese who have been given training by the Indonesians specifically for sabotage and terrorist activities in particular to coincide with the celebration of Indonesian Independence Day on 17th August. Some infiltrators have already been arrested by the Malaysian authorities during recent weeks. We also believe that arrangements have been made for infiltrating parties to link up with disaffected locals or infiltrators already established. The British and Malaysian authorities have for some time been aware of Indonesian plans, and have no doubt prepared counter measures.</p>

<p>3. We have no further information on these landings at the moment but it is on the cards that there could be further Indonesian-inspired activity, including sabotage attempts.</p>

<p>4. A copy of this note has been given to the Department of Defence for their Minister.</p>

<p>2 17 August. Subsequent cablegrams advised that 33 infiltrators landed at Pontian Besar, followed over the next two days by 30 at Kukup (southern Johore), and 41 at Benut (near Pontian).</p>

<p>3 Presumably, ‘numbers’.</p>
