<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 203. [1]</p>

<p>1. Immediately asked the Dutch for facilities to make reply over radio as the Dutch radio is the only means available and consequently showed them the text proposed.</p>

<p>They object to making of reply as well as the text, especially to second sentence, and have referred the matter to The Hague.</p>

<p>If you thought fit you might have it broadcast over Radio Australia in the Indonesian Session.</p>

<p>Is there any objection to my informing Jenkins of the text of the reply and that facilities were not given?</p>
