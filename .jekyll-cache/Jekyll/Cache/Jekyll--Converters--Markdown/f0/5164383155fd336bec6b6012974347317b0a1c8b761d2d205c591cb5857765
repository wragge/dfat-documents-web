I"Ÿ<p>Letter CANBERRA, 10 January 1946</p>

<p>I have the honour to refer to and thank you for your Note of 3rd January, 1946 [1], extending to the Government of Australia on behalf of the Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and China, an invitation to participate in the Far Eastern Commission on the basis of certain specified terms of reference.</p>

<p>It is observed that the Commission may only take action with the concurrence of four Powers, namely the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and China, in addition to the requirement of a simple majority. The Australian Government is strongly opposed to the inclusion of this veto power and must therefore give further consideration to the invitation.</p>
