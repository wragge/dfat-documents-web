<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Your telegrams. Hodgson reinstructed in strongest terms on receipt message through Heydon. Glad we are so much in accord. Your message to Hodgson very helpful. I am not reporting all our moves but at each centre we are pressing view point. Any messages personally from you to London and Washington would be helpful.</p>
