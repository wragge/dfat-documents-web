<p>MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Before I received your latest message [1], I had already replied to your earlier one [2] which you will have received. [3] My views are fully expressed there. We must assert our right of initiative and participation in matters directly affecting region. As you know whole notion of regional co-operation for Security and Welfare in this area was initiated by me and we must not lose present opportunity. Question of time and place is extremely important as I point out in my earlier message.</p>
