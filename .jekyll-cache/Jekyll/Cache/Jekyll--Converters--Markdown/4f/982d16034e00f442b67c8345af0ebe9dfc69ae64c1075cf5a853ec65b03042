I"%<p>Cablegram 136, LONDON, 10 May 1948, 8.30 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 102[1] and my telegram H. No. 179.</p>

<p>E.R.P. Commonwealth Liaison Committee.</p>

<p>You will have seen from my telegram H. No. 179 that in view of the interest shown by other Governments concerned we are anxious to go ahead with the establishment of the proposed Committee as soon as possible. We were sorry to learn from your telegram No. 102 that you did not feel that proposed Committee would be the best means of keeping Australia informed on E.R.P. matters. We feel that there may perhaps have been some misunderstanding as to our intentions in proposing the setting up of the Committee. It was not of course designed to supersede the existing normal exchange of views on policy by direct communications between Governments or by the present machinery for furnishing information through the High Commissioners in London. Our object was to provide a medium for communication of further information on E.R.P. subjects at the official level on an entirely informal and non-committal basis.</p>

<p>2. We hope that the above explanation may resolve the doubts felt by the Australian Government as regards their association with the Committee. We should of course be pleased to welcome an Australian representative if on reconsideration the Australian Government wished to participate.[2]</p>

<p>[2] The Australian Government replied that Beasley would convey its views to the UK Government.</p>
