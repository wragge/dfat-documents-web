<p>New Zealand: Closer Economic Relations with Australia</p>

<p>Reactions to the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Anthony last week have been cautious and optimistic.</p>

<p>2. Prime Minister Muldoon, speaking to journalists after Cabinet on 1 November, confirmed that Cabinet had approved the agreement reached with Mr Anthony. He repeated several times that the substance of the agreement would not be disclosed â€˜to anyoneâ€™ until it had been considered by both Cabinets (i.e., New Zealand and Australia). He said that the terminal dates remained non-negotiable but that there had been some changes on the question of access (â€˜I think we have been able to help him a little without damaging our own manufacturers. But I cannot go beyond thatâ€™). Mr Muldoon said â€˜we have an agreementâ€™ on CER, subject to confirmation from the Australian Cabinet, and added that Mr Anthony was â€˜hopefulâ€™ of obtaining this confirmation quickly. Asked about the situation should such confirmation not be forthcoming, Mr Muldoon said â€˜I think really we have just about got to the end of the possibility of negotiating any further changesâ€™.</p>
