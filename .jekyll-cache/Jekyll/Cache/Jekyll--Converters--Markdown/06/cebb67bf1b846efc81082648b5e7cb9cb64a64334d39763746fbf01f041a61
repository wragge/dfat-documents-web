<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Please convey following message to the President [2] with the utmost expedition. Begins.</p>

<p>General Douglas MacArthur having arrived in Australia the Commonwealth Government desire to nominate him as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in this theatre. [3]</p>

<p>The Australian Government feels that his leadership of the Allied forces in this theatre will be an inspiration to the Australian people and all the forces who will be privileged to serve under his command.</p>

<p>If this nomination is approved might I be informed of the text and time of any announcement. [4]</p>
