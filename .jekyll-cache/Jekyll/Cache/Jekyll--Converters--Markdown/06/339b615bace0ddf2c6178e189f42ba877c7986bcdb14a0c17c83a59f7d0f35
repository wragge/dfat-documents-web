<p>This note outlines the proposed program for discussions with New Zealand.</p>

<p>The Joint Working Party is to meet in Wellington this week (30 March to 1 April). During the Joint Working Party meetings an ‘exposure draft’ is to be discussed with New Zealand. This draft has been prepared as a possible basis for public presentation of a final CER package to meet the Government’s undertaking in relation to consultations with State Governments and other interested parties.</p>

<p>The text of the exposure draft is based largely on Part I of the draft Joint Report of Permanent Heads.<a href="#f1">1</a> Work on the draft is without prejudice to the preparation of a final version of the Joint Report of Permanent Heads in the light of further negotiations.</p>

<p>Mr Scully proposes to chair a meeting of Australian Permanent Heads on Tuesday 13 April in Canberra to discuss the exposure draft and Australia’s negotiating tactics.</p>

<p>A meeting of Australian and New Zealand Permanent Heads is then to take place, in Canberra, on Wednesday 14 and Thursday 15 April (carrying on to 16 April if required) with a view to producing an agreed draft for consideration by both Governments.</p>

<p>Mr Anthony is tentatively scheduled to visit New Zealand in the week beginning 19 April for further negotiations with New Zealand Ministers.</p>
