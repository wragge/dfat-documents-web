<p>IMPORTANT MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister: My Cite. M. 151. [1]</p>

<p>All of His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions have now</p>

<p>concurred in our proposal to proceed at the appropriate moment</p>

<p>with denunciation of the Commercial Treaty. [2]We are accordingly</p>

<p>informing the United States Government that we propose to take</p>

<p>this step immediately there is any overt act on the part of Japan.</p>

<p>2. The Commonwealth Government have stressed to us the importance</p>

<p>of following up the above action with intensified economic</p>

<p>restrictions. We fully agree with this view and hope to telegraph</p>

<p>detailed proposals as soon as we have received further indications</p>

<p>of the United States Government’s intentions; see my Circ. M.158.</p>

<p>[3]</p>

<p>3. In the meantime certain further possible measures have also</p>

<p>occurred to us. They are:</p>

<p>1. closing of the Japanese Consulate General at Singapore;</p>

<p>2. placing of Ishihara and Okura on the statutory list. [4]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Document 7.</p>

<p>2 The 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The</p>

<p>Commonwealth Govt in fact regarded this as a misinterpretation of</p>

<p>its views. See the cablegram of 19 July dispatched to Sir John</p>

<p>Latham, Minister to Japan, as no. 204 and to R. G. Casey, Minister</p>

<p>to the United States, as no. 631, on file AA : A981, Far East 20B,</p>

<p>i.</p>

<p>3 Dispatched 16 July. On file AA : A1608, A41/1/1, xxiii.</p>

<p>4 The Commonwealth Govt concurred in both these proposals. See</p>

<p>cablegram 451 of 19 July on the file cited in note 3.</p>
