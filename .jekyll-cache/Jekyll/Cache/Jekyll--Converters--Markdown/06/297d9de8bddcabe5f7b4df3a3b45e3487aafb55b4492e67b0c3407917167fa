<p>SECRET [BRONX] [1]</p>

<p>After telephoning to the President [2] the Chief of the United States Naval Staff [3] has told the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet [4] to make reconnaissance flights between Manila and Kamranh Bay as requested by Britain. Aircraft have been instructed not to approach Japanese ships in a manner to indicate offensive intention but are authorised to defend themselves if attacked.</p>

<p>Other than the above the President will not make any major decision involving the United States policy until he has had Cabinet discussions in Washington immediately on his return here tomorrow, Monday December 1st probably at 12 noon.</p>

<p>Secretary of State [5] said to the British Ambassador [6] this morning that it would be helpful if Thailand were to invite the British to take up line in Kra Isthmus but he scarcely supposed that they would do this until it was too late.</p>
