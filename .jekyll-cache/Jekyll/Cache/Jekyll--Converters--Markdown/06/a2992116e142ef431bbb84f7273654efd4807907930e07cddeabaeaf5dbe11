I"Í<p>Minute CANBERRA, 7 November 1947</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>The Security Council has three times ordered a cessation of hostilities in Indonesia: On 1st August, the Security Council called upon the parties â€˜to cease hostilities forthwithâ€™; on 25th August, â€˜to adhere strictly to the recommendation of the Security Council of 1st August, 1947â€™; on 1st November â€˜to cease any activities or incitement to activities which contravene that resolutionâ€™.</p>

<p>Djokjakarta Radio reported on 6th November that seven Dutch aircraft attacked Bandjarnegora on 4th November, killing 7 civilians, and wounding 4. Hilversum Radio is reported to have admitted that â€˜drastic measuresâ€™ were taken against Bandjarnegora in retaliation for the explosion of a land mine said to have been fired by the Republican Army Command in that township.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the responsibility for these actions, they show a clear contempt for the Security Councilâ€™s thrice repeated instructions. The Security Council cannot afford to show itself powerless in a more or less minor instance of unlawful warfare, if it is ever to wield the slightest authority in dealing with more serious breaches of the peace.</p>

<p>The alternatives are to ignore the violations of its instructions which are in effect made under Article 40, and res[ign] [1] itself to the impotence of the League Council, or to enforce its decisions now.</p>

<p>Moreover, as initiator of the Councilâ€™s action, Australia will have shown itself incapable of maintaining its standards if this challenge to the authority of the United Nations does not receive a strong reply from our representatives.</p>

<p>I suggest that the Australian representative might move that in view of the continued violation of the ceasefire, [a] Committee be instructed immediately to draw up plans for enforcement measures under Article 41 within a specified time.</p>

<p>2 Addressed to the Australian Delegation at the United Nations, the draft cablegram contained the points made in Throssellâ€™s minute together with the observation that while a proposal for the establishment of a Security Council committee to prepare plans for enforcement measures would probably encounter strong opposition, it was felt that even if rejected such a proposal would demonstrate Australiaâ€™s support for the United Nations and that it could go â€˜a long way to reduce the impression that the cease fire can be ignored with impunityâ€™. Shann forwarded Throssellâ€™s minute to McIntyre on 7 November with the comment that he not only supported Throssellâ€™s contentions, he had indeed suggested them.</p>

<p>Throssellâ€™s proposal for the establishment of a Security Council committee was not accepted and the draft cablegram was not sent, but a cablegram was dispatched at Burtonâ€™s direction to Kirby (Document 408).</p>
