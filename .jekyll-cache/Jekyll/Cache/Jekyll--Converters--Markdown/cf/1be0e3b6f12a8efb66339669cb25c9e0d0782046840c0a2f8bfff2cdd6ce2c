<p>288. CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>In informal conversation this afternoon Allison made the following comments which may be of interest:</p>

<p>(a) Since his return Dulles has discussed within the Department the question of the inclusion of the Philippines in Defence Arrangement and has found a strong disposition for the inclusion of the Philippines as an original signatory. Allison said that the inclusion of the Philippines would greatly assist the United States Government in resisting the Philippinesâ€™ claim for reparations and would put the United States in a stronger position to insist on the implementation by the Philippines Government of the Bell Mission report,[1] moreover, it was felt that the Philippines should be included in view of the fact that the United States had base rights in the Philippines.</p>

<p>(b) No decision had been reached concerning the possible visit by Dulles to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom had not extended an invitation to Dulles nor had Dulles let it be known that he would welcome any invitation. (See also our telegram No. 281 of 27th February.)[2]</p>

<p>_1 The United States Economic Survey Mission to the Philippines, of which D. W. Bell was chief, had reported to Truman on 9 October 1950. The report had recommended that, if the Philippines Government undertook steps to carry out the essential economic, financial and social reforms, a quarter of a billion dollar assistance programme over five years should be extended by the US Government with expenditure of funds subject to the supervision and control of a technical mission to be sent to the Philippines.</p>

<p>2 Satterthwaite had informally told the Australian Embassy that Dulles would meet with Franks that day, and that he would probably visit the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands to discuss Japanese Peace Treaty developments.</p>
