I"Ó<p>Australian High Commission, London, 7 December 1966</p>

<p>You asked me to let you have some information in greater detail in respect of particular cases of Australian citizens affected by the Commonwealth Immigrantsâ€™ Act. This message followed a talk that Sir Alexander Downer had with Sir Saville Garner and yourself on this subject.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>By sheer coincidence, I have seen some papers which have just arrived and which concern a young man whom I know well, as indeed I know his family. I can vouch for the authenticity of his claims and reactions, and I cannot do better than attach a copy of his letter to another friend of mine, Dr Moran of Toorak in Australia, as well as a copy of a letter from his father to the British High Commissioner in Canberra. They are self-explanatory.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>Good and sensible Australians undoubtedly are shocked by restrictions on their stay in England. The very thought that this could happen to them is so contrary to the mutual freedom of movement, backwards and forwards, which has obtained between Australia and England throughout our Commonwealth history and before. I mention this because, in sending the correspondence over, Dr Moran, who served in both World Wars, firstly with the British and secondly with the Australian Army, himself writes critically of current practice and mentions in passing that last time he landed in England his passport was stamped indicating that his stay was limited to three months, this despite the fact that he had lived in London for eighteen years and had engaged in practice as a consulting physician.</p>

<p>You will note that Canetâ€™s mother is an Englishwoman by birth and that the lad himself received part of his education at St Paulâ€™s School, Kensington.</p>

<p>The terseness of the notification from the Ministry of Labour to Canet has completely floored Dr Moran and the Canet family. This has involved unhappy reactions among people who all their lives have been the staunchest friends of England and English traditions. [â€¦]</p>

<p>Another case concerns the sister of an officer of this High Commission, a Miss Thompson, who for 12 years lived in the British Colony of Hong Kong with her sister and brotherâ€“inâ€“law, who is an English citizen. The latter couple have returned to live in England.</p>

<p>Because of her associations in Hong Kong with friends of her brother-in-law and sister and the fact that she has not been in Australia for so long, and also her natural inclinations and experiences in the latter part of her life, Miss Thompson in a sense feels more of an English citizen than an Australian. She is desolated at the thought of being required to return to Australia. I attach copies of papers which also deal with her case.<a href="#f3">3</a> She is in good health, has a job at Gallahers at Â£1,100 sterling per annum and assets worth at least Â£2,000 sterling.</p>

<p>There is also the case of Mr Barry Alldis, which I think was mentioned to Sir Saville by the High Commissioner, and I refresh your memory by enclosing a copy of a letter from the Hon Sir John Cramer, a Member of the House of Representatives in Canberra, to Sir Alexander Downer about this matter.<a href="#f4">4</a></p>

<p>Other cases about which we have some knowledge are summarised hereunder.</p>

<p><em>Mr D J K Keagan</em> â€”who came to England with an offer of employment with the â€˜Financial Timesâ€™. He claims the British Trade Commission in Sydney advised him to come to London and regularise his employment position on arrival, as there was insufficient time to do so in Australia. He was given an entry permit for six months and had great difficulty in having this renewed for a further six months. In fact, it was only done so on representations from this office. Mr Keagan is well qualified as a Bachelor of Economics and a journalist with the â€˜Australian Financial Reviewâ€™. He wishes to acquire more, appropriate, experience in London.</p>

<p><em>Mrs E Kenway</em> â€”a wellâ€“toâ€“do Australian property owner who has been visiting this country for many years and who was considerably distressed on being questioned as to her intentions when she came back to London after visiting her daughter in Athens.</p>

<p><em>Mr B J Young</em> â€”the nineteenâ€“yearâ€“old son of Colonel Young of the Australian Army Staff who had come to join his father for the rest of the latterâ€™s tour of duty. He was given an entry permit for three months only.</p>

<p><em>Mr G F V Cole</em> â€”a man of substantial means, aged seventyâ€“eight years, was given the usual six months entry permit. An extension was requested in the High Commissionerâ€™s name and the messenger who took the letter and passport to the Home Office asked whether, in view of the High Commissionerâ€™s interest, the endorsement could be altered whilst he waited. He was informed that the matter would receive consideration and we would be informed in due course.</p>

<p>There is also the case of Miss Diana Harvey, the daughter of a reputable citizen of Sydney, who arrived in the United Kingdom on 12th May last and who was unhappily deported that evening to Malaga, which had been her last stoppingâ€“place before arriving in London. To make matters worse, it so happens that her father was born in England I gather, and under the existing rules apparently she would have had a legal right of entry anyhow. This was a very unhappy case which has caused illâ€“feeling and resentment among those who know the family.</p>

<p>I think perhaps I have given you enough to work on. If there is any other way in which I can help you, please let me know[â€¦]</p>
