I"‡<p>Dispatch 44/1/2 (extract) WELLINGTON, 8 January 1944</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform you that on 7th January, the day prior</p>

<p>to my departure for Auckland on my way to Australia, I had a long</p>

<p>interview with the Prime Minister. Mr. Fraser discussed the</p>

<p>forthcoming conference to be held in Canberra and made several</p>

<p>observations which I think are of considerable interest.</p>

<p>2. Speaking of the future of New Caledonia, Mr. Fraser said that</p>

<p>he would not like to see the French ousted from this possession.</p>

<p>Such a step would, he felt, come about only from American pressure</p>

<p>and would result in complete American occupation. He expressed the</p>

<p>view that New Zealand would be willing to share responsibility for</p>

<p>the defence of New Caledonia.</p>

<p>3. Mr. Fraser also informed me that New Zealand had no wish to</p>

<p>upset the scope or authority of the British High Commissioner in</p>

<p>the Western Pacific. He took the view that everything must be done</p>

<p>to maintain Britainâ€™s interest in this area. (I might add that</p>

<p>there is a certain feeling here that Britain has already lost</p>

<p>interest in the Pacific and that the omission of any air links</p>

<p>between America and Australia and New Zealand in the proposals</p>

<p>decided upon by Lord Beaverbrookâ€™s inter-Dominion conference on</p>

<p>civil aviation [1] is held to be indicative of this trend.)</p>

<p>4. In speaking of future armistices, Mr. Fraser said definitely</p>

<p>that, despite his Governmentâ€™s previous attitude to the signing of</p>

<p>the armistice with Italy, New Zealand wished to play a full part</p>

<p>in arrangements so far as the Pacific was concerned.</p>
