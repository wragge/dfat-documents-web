<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 138. [1] INDONESIA.</p>

<p>1. First four paragraphs of the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement [2] (ending with restoration of peace) was published in Pravda today.</p>

<p>2. Today I had informal talk with Yerofeev, head of the second European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed the matter set out in the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement and expressed the hope that the Soviet Government would give full support in the Security Council to the Australian initiative. He was fully aware that the statement had been made but would not indicate disapproval of developments in Indonesia; he merely said that the Australian proposals would receive fullest consideration by the Soviet Government.</p>
