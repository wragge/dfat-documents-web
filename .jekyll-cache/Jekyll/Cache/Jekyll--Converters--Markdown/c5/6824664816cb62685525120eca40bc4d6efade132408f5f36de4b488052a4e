<p>Officials stressed that, on the question of the dairy trade between Australia and New Zealand, no commitment should be given by New Zealand to either a Government to Government agreement to limit dairy exports from New Zealand to Australia or a voluntary restraint arrangement concluded between the New Zealand Dairy Board and the representatives of the Australian dairy industry. To pursue such a course of action would be to step on to a very slippery slope indeed. All that could be said to the Australians at this stage was that any formal limitation on the dairy trade between Australia and New Zealand was unacceptable to New Zealand, notwithstanding any restraint which might have been exercised voluntarily by the Dairy Board in the past; such a formal limitation would represent a reduction in access and would hence be completely contrary to the goals of the Closer Economic Relationship. In New Zealandâ€™s view, the Dairy Board should be allowed to export such quantities of dairy produce to Australia as it considered appropriate in light of all the factors relevant at the time. This was the view that would continue to be transmitted to the Australians.</p>

<p>Officials also noted that the New Zealand Manufacturersâ€™ Federation had recently qualified somewhat the position that its representatives had outlined in person to the Committee some weeks ago. However, it did not seem that these qualifications would affect the conduct of the Permanent Headsâ€™ meeting during the coming few days; they might nevertheless be a factor in the Governmentâ€™s deliberations on the Permanent Headsâ€™ final recommendations.</p>
