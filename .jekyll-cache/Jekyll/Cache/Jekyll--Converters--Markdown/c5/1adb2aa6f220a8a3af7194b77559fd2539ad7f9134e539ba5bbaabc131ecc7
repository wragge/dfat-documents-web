I"Ë<p>Letter WASHINGTON, 26 February 1940</p>

<p>My telegram to you No. 32/40 of 23rd February [2], regarding the Worldâ€™s Fair in New York, raises at once the question of channels of communication on certain matters which I think should be settled without delay. I am sure you will agree that, on any question affecting this country, and involving Australian government policy, I should be advised first, even though it be a matter, such as the New York Worldâ€™s Fair, which as regards details is dealt with by Macgregor. [3] Otherwise I may be placed in an embarrassing position with the Administration here. I do not for a moment suggest that on matters of detail the Department should not communicate direct with Macgregor-in fact I think they should do so-but on matters of policy or anything which may involve discussions with or representations to the State Department, I think all communications should be sent to me in the first place and I hope you will be able to arrange this with your several colleagues.</p>

<p>_1 This letter was received in Canberra on or shortly before 27 March 1940 when Gullettâ€™s successor John McEwen forwarded a copy to the Minister for Commerce, A. G. Cameron, with a memorandum (on the file here cited) which read in part: â€˜The caw in question arose before die Minister had become established, and I believe the procedure for communication between the Commonwealth Government and the Legation is now well appreciated.â€™ The letter was received in the External Affairs Dept registry on 28 March 1940.</p>
