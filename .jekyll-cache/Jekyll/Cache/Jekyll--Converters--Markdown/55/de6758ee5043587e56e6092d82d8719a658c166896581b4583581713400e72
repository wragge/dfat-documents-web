<p>326 SECRET IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>CANBERRA</p>

<p>Your 389.</p>

<p>Your detailed report on discussions with Yoshino appreciated.</p>

<p>However, I am disturbed at the views which you are expressing on the likely attitude of the Australian Government, possible compromises and so on. I have arranged for you to be kept fully briefed on the progress of the negotiations for your background information and not for use in discussions with Japanese officials. I would therefore ask you to refrain from giving your interpretation of the Australian attitude unless specifically requested by us to do so. In the absence of such a request your advice should be confined to the supply of factual information.</p>

<p>You will appreciate that it is tactically unsound to become involved in simultaneous negotiations in Canberra and Tokyo.</p>

<p>Therefore in any further approaches you should endeavour to obtain Japanese reactions without commenting on likely Australian view.</p>
