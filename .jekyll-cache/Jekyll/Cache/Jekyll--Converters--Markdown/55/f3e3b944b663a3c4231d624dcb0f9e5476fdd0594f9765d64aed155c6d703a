<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>I duly received our telegram regarding the French suggestions on the subject of war aims. [1] I greatly appreciate your informing me of your views which have been noted with much interest. I also gave the question immediate consideration and had hoped to take it up with my colleagues in Council today but other questions requiring immediate determination made it necessary to defer its consideration. I shall telegraph you again immediately when such consideration has been given.</p>
