<p>SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>My telegram No.158 [1], your telegram 124. [2]</p>

<p>In absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is spending a few days in the country, I discussed the situation with the head of the Political Section this morning.</p>

<p>2. He was moderately reassuring about Van Mookâ€™s trip and expressed the opinion that there was no question for the time being of further military action.</p>

<p>3. He reverted to the subject of my telegram 159 [3] and indicated that they would like to see United States as a power and suggested as its representative Dean Acheson or Eisenhower but not a political figure.</p>

<p>4. He seemed to think that the objective should be the renewal of negotiations on basis of Linggadjati but the Indonesian Government would need to be strong enough to control its military. A first essential would be agreement on a joint commission to pacify disturbed areas.</p>
