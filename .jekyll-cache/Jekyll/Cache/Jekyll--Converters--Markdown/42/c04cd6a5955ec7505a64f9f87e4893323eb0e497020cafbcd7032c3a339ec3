<p>Top Secret</p>

<p><strong>Possible Use of Australian Forces in the Defence of Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>At its meeting on 18th January, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee considered Submission No. 588 by the Minister for Defence relating to a message from the United Kingdom Prime Minister dated 15th January on the situation in the Malaysian area arising from the recent build-up of Indonesian forces.<a href="#f1">1</a> Paragraphs 9–17 of the submission considered the availability of additional Australian forces for Malaysia in the light of the statement in Mr. Wilson’s letter that ‘there still remains a need for additional helicopters, SAS troops and a further infantry battalion.’ In reply, copy of which is attached hereto, (Annex A), no specific offer of additional forces was made.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>The Minister for Defence has forwarded to me two messages arising from his discussions with the Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur. Attached at Annex B is a copy of Kuala Lumpur cablegram No. 184 which records the results of Senator Paltridge’s discussion with Malaysian Ministers.<a href="#f3">3</a> In a subsequent message (cablegram No. 188 from Kuala Lumpur),<a href="#f4">4</a> Senator Paltridge advised:—</p>

<p>‘If, in view of present circumstances, Cabinet considers that an answer should be given quickly, I would be agreeable to advising the availability of 1 squadron of SAS and granting approval for the use of 3 RAR in Borneo.</p>

<p>2. A quick decision on the number of .303 rifles that can be made available should be possible and would be very much welcomed here.</p>

<p>3. Decisions on the other requests which have rather sharper problems could be deferred until after my return.’</p>

<p>3. In the light of our discussions in the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of Cabinet, I requested the Chiefs of Staff Committee to examine further the requests communicated by the Malaysian Government through Senator Paltridge and a copy of their report is attached at Annex ‘C’.<a href="#f5">5</a> In summary the Chiefs of Staff have recommended that:—</p>

<p>(a) our Strategic Reserve battalion 3 RAR (with supporting elements if required) and 1 SAS squadron of about 100 all ranks from Australia be made available for deployment to the Borneo territories on rotation;</p>

<p>(b) a further battalion from Australia should not be offered for service in Malaysia in addition to 3 RAR;</p>

<p>(c) no additional helicopters should be made available for deployment to Malaysia at present;</p>

<p>(d) Australia should not offer to assist in commando training, although some assistance by way of specialised equipment could be offered if required.</p>

<p>4. I submit the report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee for consideration by the Committee.</p>
