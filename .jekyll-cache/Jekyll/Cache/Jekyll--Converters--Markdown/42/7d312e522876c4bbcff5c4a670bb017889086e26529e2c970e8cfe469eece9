I"<p>Cablegram unnumbered SYDNEY, 17 January 1939</p>

<p>Professor Meldrumâ€™s [sic] letter [1] hardly calls for comment. It contains nothing new. With some of it I violently disagree. I strongly advise taking no notice whatever of it. Will write on my return from Western tour. [2] Regards.</p>
