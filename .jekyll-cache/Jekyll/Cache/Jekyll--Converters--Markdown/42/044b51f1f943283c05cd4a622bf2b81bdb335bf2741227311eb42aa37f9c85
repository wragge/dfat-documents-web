<p>We would be glad if you would inform the Commonwealth Relations Office that the Australian Government is willing to participate in informal talks regarding instructions to overseas representatives in event of emergency as suggested by the Canadian Government. We do not wish you to become committed to any course of action until we have had an opportunity to consider the matter further in the light of your reports on the initial discussions.</p>
