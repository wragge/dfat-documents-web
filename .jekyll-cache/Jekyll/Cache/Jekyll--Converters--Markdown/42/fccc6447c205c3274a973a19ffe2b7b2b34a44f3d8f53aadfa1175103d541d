I"=<p>Canberra, 22 August 1963</p>

<p>Secret</p>

<p>I have the letter of today’s date signed by your Deputy High Commissioner.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>The Minister for External Affairs and I have had an opportunity of discussing this matter. The views of the Australian Government may be put in this way—</p>

<p>(1) We think that the approach of the British Government to this matter is well justified. You will understand that we are not pressing the British Government to make further concessions; indeed, we think they have behaved most reasonably. Our support will be the same whether or not they decide to grant the further concessions of clerical assistants.</p>

<p>(2) If U Thant proceeds with due expedition and is not diverted from his course by extravagant Indonesian demands, we would still think it worthwhile that the Malaysia date should be somewhat deferred into September, the important thing being that the Secretary-General has been on the job and has arrived at conclusions.</p>

<p>(3) We attach importance to this because of the desirability of having understanding and, if possible, support on the part of the Afro-Asian nations.</p>

<p>(4) But if the effect of the present Indonesian demands is to persuade U Thant not to make a report or to indicate that his enquiries will be unduly prolonged, then in that event we think the British Government would be justified in saying that as dilatory tactics are not to be allowed to succeed, they will proclaim Malaysia on August 31.</p>

<p>(5) If by reason of impossible demands or obstructive tactics on the part of Indonesia, the present plans for the United Nations enquiry collapsed, the United Kingdom can count on the firm support of my Government for its decision in bringing Malaysia into being.</p>

<p>1  Gurth Kimber. The letter sought Australian support for Britain’s decision to stand firm on its final concession that the observer teams from Indonesia, Malaya and the Philippines each comprise 4 observers plus 4 clerical assistants. See editorial note, <em>UN Malaysia Mission</em>.</p>
