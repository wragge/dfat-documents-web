I"¼<p>Cablegram S[L] [1] 1 (extract) CANBERRA, n.d.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL FOR BRUCE TO BE DECYPHERED BY STIRLING [2]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>2. May I point out confidentially how embarrassing it is for the Government to have our decisions over A.I.F. ignored and to send [3] further request upon the same topic. You are (however) out of touch with home defence position here and that is necessarily a controlling factor. I have already wired to Cripps [4] as to the matter and greatly fear that if matter goes further damage may be done to the best interests of the Empire.</p>

<p>If I may say so Page [5] seems to have acted in (direct) opposition to his instructions and matters can hardly continue in this way.</p>

<p>3. I am obliged to you for your assistance over the Lend-Lease Agreement where intervention seems to have had some effect. [6]</p>

<p>1 All subsequent cablegrams in this series were prefixed SL(i.e.</p>

<p>special cablegram to London)and it seems probable that this one should also have been prefixed SL and not S, which was the prefix for special cablegrams from London to Canberra.</p>
