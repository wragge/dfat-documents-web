<p>The attached papers [1] were discussed at J.I.C. meeting today.</p>

<p>[2] Youâ€™ll see that there are many things quite out of line with us.</p>

<p>Apart from a few amendments the Câ€™ttee all agreed to the paper.</p>

<p>I have made it clear that Iâ€™m not in a position to endorse it.</p>

<p>See paras 7-15 &amp; 18-23. [3] The amended report will be sent up in a day or two. Miss Wilson can show you if you want. [4]</p>

<p>3 paragraphs 18-23 in the draft correspond to paragraphs 37-43 in Document 122.</p>

<p>4 Burton annotated the note: â€˜We have given our apprec[iation] [Document 121]: you should not take pan in discussion on absurd document such as this.â€™</p>
