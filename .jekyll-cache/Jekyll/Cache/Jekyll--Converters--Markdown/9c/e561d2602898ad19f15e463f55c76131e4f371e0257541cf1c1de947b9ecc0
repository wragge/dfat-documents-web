I"à<p>Letter MELBOURNE, 14 May 1943</p>

<p>With reference to our conversation this morning, and the â€˜aide- memoireâ€™ [1] which you kindly left with me regarding recent speeches by Dr. Evatt, you will appreciate that I am not in possession of the complete text of his statements [2] and am relying on the very abridged telegraphed press reports which you submitted. Even from these, however, it is clear to me that Dr.</p>

<p>Evatt did not imply more than that there should be friendly collaboration and co-operation as regards the territories in which our two countries are specially interested, and as regards which we will have definite obligations in the post-war period.</p>

<p>The use of the word â€˜partnerâ€™ may have caused some misunderstanding in your mind but as between the members of the British Commonwealth it is a word freely and commonly used, denoting a close association imbued with high ideals for the prosecution of a great purpose and a great cause. At the same time, the respective members of the Commonwealth are completely autonomous and independent.</p>

<p>I feel that Dr. Evatt was in reality paying a compliment to your people, in that he hoped that the close co-operation and comradeship established by the sacrifice of war would be carried into the paths of peace, to the mutual advantage, prosperity and security of our respective peoples.</p>

<p>2 Curtin subsequently received the full text of an address delivered by Evatt at Holland House, New York, on 26 April and on 21 May forwarded a copy of it to van Aerssen (see file AA:A989, 43/600/5/1/2).</p>
