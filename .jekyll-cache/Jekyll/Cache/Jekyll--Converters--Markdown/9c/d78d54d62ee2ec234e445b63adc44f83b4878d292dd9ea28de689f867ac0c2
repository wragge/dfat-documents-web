<p>TOP SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>After discussion with Prime Minister I feel I should tell you that he is strongly of opinion that discussions on cease fire cannot be allowed to drag on. He feels that the Committee should announce to both parties a time limit of say one week or so and that if no solution has been reached by that time Committee should report matter back to Security Council.</p>

<p>2. You will now have received Dr. Evattâ€™s interpretation of 1st November resolution [1], which should assist in bringing pressure on the Dutch under threat that reference back to Security Council will show them clearly in the wrong.</p>
