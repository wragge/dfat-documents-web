<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Netherlands Delegation propose to sponsor Indonesia as a whole for associate membership with two seats on the delegation for the Republic if they desire. [1] The Netherlands Delegation believes that Renville principles of 19th January [2] drawn up by the Good Offices Committee [i]s adequate authority. Delegation from the Republic present and will not accept Netherlands sponsorship. Will apply for associate membership sponsored by India in these circumstances. Your instructions authorise me to support admission of the Republic as observer. Should I support their application for admission as associate member? Understand United Kingdom and New Zealand will oppose independent application of the Republic.</p>

<p>Appreciate urgent reply. Matter likely to arise Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>2 Presumably Documents 23 and 24.</p>
