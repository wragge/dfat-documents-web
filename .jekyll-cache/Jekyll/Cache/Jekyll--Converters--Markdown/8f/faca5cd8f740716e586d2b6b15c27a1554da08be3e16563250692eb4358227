I"j<p>Cablegram EC12 LONDON, 14 September 1945, 9.28 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>After a weeks struggle during which I have been in the closest touch with the British Government and representatives of other countries on the Council of Foreign Ministers we have succeeded in obtaining an invitation to attend the Council on Monday next in connection with disputed territorial adjustments between Italy and Yugoslavia. The particular matter is not itself of supreme importance to Australia but I think it will establish the right to be heard on all aspects of the Peace Settlements of greater concern to us, e.g. the Pacific. I regard this result which also extends to the other Dominions as being due almost exclusively to Australiaâ€™s initiative followed up by timely support from the British Labour Government. My immediately following en clair telegram contains the text of statement which was issued here by me today. [1]</p>
