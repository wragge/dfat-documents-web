I"÷<p>Cablegram 396 BATAVIA, 6 November 1947</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>Regret that constant discussions, meetings and travel between Batavia and Djokjakarta have prevented me from informing you developments and views as they occur. Further the situation has changed from time to time so rapidly that I have hesitated to communicate in case I would have given wrong impression.</p>

<p>Subsequent events have confirmed this.</p>

<p>2. Returned from Djokjakarta this morning and have been in conference ever since and there is formal meeting with Dutch tonight.</p>

<p>3. Every indication meeting for substantive discussions will take place in two weeks time on U.S. ship in Java waters but I have suggested interim programme which will, I hope, carry matter a long way before ship discussions commence.</p>

<p>4. Time does not allow more now but hope to send detailed personal history and analysis tomorrow morning which will attempt answer your cablegram No. 326. [1] I appreciate Prime Ministerâ€™s anxiety and personal fatigue makes me long for conclusion of task but hand has now been set to plough.</p>

<p>5. Security Councilâ€™s Resolution 1st November and importance matter from Australian interest makes me stress personal opinion desirability of having Australian Military Observers at full strength [2], particularly in view of personal opinions of Dyke and Spence as expressed to you and myself and Dykeâ€™s senior rank.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Document 403. The detailed account promised was not in fact dispatched until 12 November (see Document 416).</p>

<p>2 Chesterman had remained in Batavia and arrangements had been made for Campbell, but not Dyke or Spence, to return from Australia to the NEI.</p>
