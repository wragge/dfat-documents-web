<p><strong>Grant for Papua and New Guinea Administration in 1967/68</strong></p>

<p>A sizable increase in the Commonwealth grant is again inescapable if the Territory is to continue to move towards economic viability and political selfâ€“determination.</p>

<p>2. We are inclined to agree, however, with the Treasurerâ€™s recommendation that the grant should be $77m. and not $81 m. as proposed by the Minister.<a href="#f3">3</a> This represents a 10% increase on the original grant approved last year, and on the Treasurerâ€™s reckoning would allow the introduction of an Administration budget close to 16% higher in total than in 1966/67. This rate of increase, coupled with a willingness to consider increasing the Development Bankâ€™s capital later in the year if necessary, is certainly not ungenerous.</p>
