<p>MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>Dominions Office telegram No. 74. [1] Appears clear if Japan is to be prevented from obtaining footing in Timor, will be necessary to buy Wittouck [2] out. Information here indicates that Oil Concessions Ltd. prepared to find substantial sum with this object and Dutch apparently prepared to co-operate. I have arranged for meeting at the Foreign Office beginning of next week to discuss the whole position, at which Lord Cadman [3] will be present as I feel if any British financial participation it should be through Anglo-Iranian Company and possibly Commonwealth Oil Refineries.</p>

<p>Please advise me your views.</p>
