I"U<p>Cablegram 112 WASHINGTON, 11 February 1941</p>

<p>Personal for Hodgson from Watt.</p>

<p>Tonight I reluctantly suggested to Minister [1] he should return to Washington at once if his health permitted.</p>

<p>As I see position, staff conversations may reach impasse very soon, and political representations become necessary in endeavour to overcome United States Navy views. I feel, therefore, Minister should be here for few days to discuss situation with Halifax [2] and, if necessary, with Hull [3], even if Minister had to leave Washington again. I am making every effort to maintain necessary contacts, but my position is somewhat ambiguous as I do not possess authority of a Charge d’Affairs. [4]</p>

<p>Minister said he would probably start back tomorrow. I will telegraph when he arrives.</p>

<p>1 R. G. Casey.</p>

<p>2 U.K. Ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>3 U.S. Secretary of State.</p>

<p>4 Diplomatic usage precluded Watt from acting as Charge d’Affairs because Casey, although on leave, remained in the United States.</p>
