I"<p>Cablegram 25 NEW DELHI, 11 January 1949, 11.55 p.m.</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Press conference was given this morning by Dr. Soemitro and Mr.</p>

<p>Maramis who have arrived in Delhi. Soemitro who predominated throughout made the following points:</p>

<p>(a) The Republican emergency Government in Sumatra insisted on the withdrawal of Dutch forces, the release of Republican leaders and we understand him to say the freedom of administering the Republican Territory. Statement alleged to have been made by Republican leaders in variance with this view must not be recognised as long as they are in prison and while un-ratified by the emergency Government. While this Government would remain adamant it was just possible the Dutch would find a body of Republican puppets to support them.</p>

<p>(b) In answer to questions Soemitro said that the Delhi conference, if it did not establish a permanent committee to supervise and report on the progress of measures that the conference might suggest for Indonesiaâ€™s assistance, may provide impetus for establishing regional [1] as envisaged by the United Nations Charter.</p>

<p>(c) Soemitro understood already that communists and Republican armed forces were resisting the Dutch in a common front even if not in unison.</p>

<p>(d) The Republic had certain proposals to make to the conference regarding steps it could best take to assist them but these would await the conference itself.</p>
