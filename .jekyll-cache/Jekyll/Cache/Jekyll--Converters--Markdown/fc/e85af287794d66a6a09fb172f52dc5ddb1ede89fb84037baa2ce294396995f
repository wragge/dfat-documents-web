<p>Speaking publicly and privately of significance Australia I have used following arguments:</p>

<p>(1) Significance immensely greater than our population implies by reason size, resources, location.</p>

<p>(2) Outpost of Western civilization in Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>(3) Purchase billion dollars worth American goods last 12 years against 300,000,000 exports to America.</p>

<p>(4) Australia is not a liability to its friends as witness last war and this war.</p>

<p>(5) Australia with increasing population and strength will have increasing contribution to make towards economic development of the Pacific area.</p>

<p>Glad to have other ideas in this connection.</p>
