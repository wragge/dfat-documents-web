I"©<p>Kuala Lumpur, 13 December 1962</p>

<p>441. Secret Immediate</p>

<p><strong>Brunei Revolt</strong></p>

<p>Tunku called meeting at short notice this afternoon of Senior Commonwealth Representatives to discuss Brunei situation.</p>

<p>2. High Commissioner was unable to attend (only Commonwealth representatives were Tory<a href="#f1">1</a> of United Kingdom and Bennett<a href="#f2">2</a> of New Zealand). We understand from New Zealanders that meeting took form of briefing session on Brunei situation including assessment of Indonesian intentions and was attended by leading Services Personnel.</p>

<p>3. Tunku appeared to be apprehensive that Indonesia would intervene before revolt is put down in next few days. He claimed that high level talks were held today in Djakarta which involved Service Chiefs and were presumably in connection with Brunei Revolt. He advanced evidence (not challenged by Tory) of Indonesian Military build-up in Southern Borneo and of construction of airfield on Natuna Besar<a href="#f3">3</a> which threatens route between Singapore and Borneo.</p>

<p>4. Tunku and Tory agreed it could be timely to invoke article 6 of Defence Agreement<a href="#f4">4</a> providing for â€˜consultationsâ€™ between Malaya and Britain in event of threat of armed attack against Malaya and British territory in far east region.</p>

<p>5. We will be checking further on conclusions reached at meeting.</p>
