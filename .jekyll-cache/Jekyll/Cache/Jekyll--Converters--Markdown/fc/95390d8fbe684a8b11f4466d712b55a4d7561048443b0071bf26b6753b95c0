<p>Portuguese Timor</p>

<p><em>[matter omitted]<a href="#f1">1</a></em></p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that Indonesia may be intending to take some form of action against Portuguese Timor in the near future.</p>

<p>2. Three main courses of action are open to the Indonesian Govemment:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>It may simply sever diplomatic relations with Portugal without mounting any direct operations against Portuguese Timor. This would be in accordance with a recommendation of the Cairo Conference of Non-Aligned Powers calling on participating States to break relations with Portugal. Malaysia has sought to score-off Indonesia by referring to Indonesiaâ€™s maintenance of diplomatic links with Portugal;</li>
  <li>Indonesia may be intending only covert operations, the framework for which has already been established;</li>
  <li>Indonesia may be intending an overt attack in response to a trumped-up plea for help. This, Indonesia would assess, would produce a swift and dramatic victory akin to that of India against Goa and which she may think could be won with a naval squadron and a limited number of troops without significantly disturbing present deployments. Indonesia might not annex Portuguese Timor, but merely install a puppet government under Indonesian control.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>[matter omitted]<a href="#f2">2</a></em></p>

<p>10. The political environment has changed markedly since 1963. At that time Indonesian â€˜confrontationâ€™ of Malaysia had not taken on the character of a military campaign. Since that time, also, the Australian Government has decided to undertake a substantial programme of defence expansion with Indonesian behaviour being a principal motivating factor. In todayâ€™s circumstances, Indonesian military pressure against Timor-the second of Indonesiaâ€™s three land frontiers-would produce a very strong public reaction in Australia and present the Government with very difficult problems.</p>

<p>11. It is difficult to suggest an effective policy. The ingredients of policy, in the event of identifiable Indonesian aggression, might include the following:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>to agree to Portuguese request for reinforcements to transit Australian territory and to assist with the handling of refugees; and arrange air lifts and so on;</li>
  <li>to express the view that, though unsympathetic to the professed objectives of the Portuguese Government in Timor, we condemn attempts to change the status quo by forcible interference from outside;</li>
  <li>to support action through the Security Council. It is recognised that this is unlikely to be more successful than it was in the case of Goa; but this would help convert the issue into one of the responsibility of the international community as a whole. (It is not clear at this stage just who would bring the matter before the Security Council);</li>
  <li>possibly to make public the Prime Ministerâ€™s exchanges with the Portuguese Prime Minister in order to indicate the Governmentâ€™s awareness of the dangers and policy efforts to avert them. Publication of these exchanges would show, also, that we were not to be identified with Portugal as a reactionary colonial power;</li>
  <li>to intervene diplomatically in Djakarta. The Ambassador in Djakarta has standing instructions to speak in sharp terms in the event of a likely Indonesian attack.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>1 The matter omitted indicated that the cable contained the text of a Departmental note on Portuguese Timor which was thought might be useful for Hasluck, Minister for External Affairs, during discussions with the Americans.</li>
  <li>2 The omitted paragraphs summarised Australian policy of the preceding three years.</li>
