<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your 159.</p>

<p>Korean Commission decided to observe elections by five votes to nil; France, Canada and Syria abstaining. Jackson voted in favour of observing elections, which decision was arrived at on the grounds that, â€˜there exists a reasonable degree of free atmosphere in which Democratic rights of freedom of speech, press and Assembly are recognised and respectedâ€™.</p>

<p>In telephonic conversation on 1st May, Jackson informed me that the situation was â€˜much betterâ€™ and that the authorities were very traitorous.[1] I expected to obtain his views on our future course of action today.[2]</p>

<p>_[1] The copy on the file is annotated: â€˜Surely not the right word?â€™.</p>

<p>[2] A further annotation (by Shann) reads: â€˜Mr Throssell I should say that our future course of action is determined by the manner in which Jackson has votedâ€™.</p>
