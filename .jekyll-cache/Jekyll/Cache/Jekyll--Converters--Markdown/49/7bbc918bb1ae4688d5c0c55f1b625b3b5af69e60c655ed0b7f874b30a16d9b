I"¿<p>Canberra, 3 April 1981</p>

<p>New Zealand has proposed that a meeting of Australian and New Zealand Ministers be held in Wellington from 11-13 May to consider unresolved issues and assess the prospects of agreement being reached this year on an acceptable basis for a closer economic relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>As agreed by Cabinet, I would propose to lead the Australian delegation at the forthcoming meeting and believe it would be appropriate that I be accompanied by perhaps two other Ministers; I have in mind the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon. However, this is a matter which could be settled closer to the event.</p>

<p>I will of course be bringing a submission to Cabinet in advance of the Wellington meeting, setting out the unresolved issues and recommending the line of approach to be followed in the negotiations with New Zealand Ministers.</p>

<p>The dates suggested by New Zealand are acceptable to me and I seek your concurrence to the arrangements as proposed. I am sending copies of this letter to Sir Phillip Lynch and Mr Nixon for their information.</p>
