<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Message received through service channels from Subardjo ‘Foreign Minister Indonesian Republic’ whilst expressing gratitude also mentions indignation at non-disembarkation of ‘twenty seven’ Indonesian ‘people’ and states that reason for action taken is unknown, but according to reports at order of Australian Government. Please explain personally and informally to Subardjo that the return of the twenty seven personnel to Dutch Timor was necessary in order to ensure the landing of the vast majority. In Dutch Timor they will be under our control and they will be able to return to Java as soon as that course is possible.</p>
