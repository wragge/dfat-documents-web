I"x<p>Circular Cablegram B83 LONDON, 25 March 1938</p>

<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>My telegram of 25th March Circular B 82. [1] It is proposed in the course of a few days to inform the German Government that it is our intention to replace our legation at Vienna by a Consulate- General and to ask for an exequatur [2] for the new Consul- General.</p>

<p>It will be understood that such a note to the German Government would be interpreted as constituting an act (and supplying the date) of formal recognition by His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom of the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Document 167.</p>

<p>2 An exequatur is the official recognition of a consul or commercial agent by the government of the country to which he is accredited, authorising him to exercise his functions.</p>
