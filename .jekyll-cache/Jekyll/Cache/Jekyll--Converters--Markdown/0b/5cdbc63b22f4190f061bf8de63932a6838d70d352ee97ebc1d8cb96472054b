<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Addressed to the Prime Minister. Proposed Japanese exchange.</p>

<p>Since despatch of the communication to Japanese Government with</p>

<p>reference to Japanese seamen (Dominions Office cable 368 7/12/43</p>

<p>[2]) increasing concern has been felt both here and in America</p>

<p>with regard to Allied prisoners and internees in the Far East.</p>

<p>This feeling has been greatly stimulated by statements by returned</p>

<p>Prisoners of War from Germany and Italy which have been much</p>

<p>publicised, that their condition would have been desperate but for</p>

<p>Red Cross medicines and supplies.</p>

<p>As you know, the only method of sending these supplies to</p>

<p>prisoners and internees in Far East is by exchange ships.</p>

<p>America’s view is that so urgent is the need that the detention of</p>

<p>any Japanese National which might prevent an exchange and the</p>

<p>sending of supplies on the exchange ship is not warranted.</p>

<p>American feeling on this point is strengthened by the fact that,</p>

<p>as you know, arrangements have now been. made by which supplies</p>

<p>going in either American or Empire exchange ships are being</p>

<p>pooled.</p>

<p>The ship of the American exchange which recently returned to Japan</p>

<p>carried American supplies. The Americans are naturally looking for</p>

<p>further supplies to go in the ships of the British exchange. You</p>

<p>are aware that TIERA MARU may be withdrawn by the Japanese for</p>

<p>Naval use if negotiations for British exchange break down</p>

<p>(Dominions Office cable 393 24/12 [3]) that might jeopardise all</p>

<p>further exchanges, American or British.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding feelings and the view indicated above, it is</p>

<p>recognised both here and in America that military considerations</p>

<p>must prevail. I have ascertained, however, that both here and in</p>

<p>Washington it would be greatly welcomed if, owing to improvement</p>

<p>in the military situation or for any other reason, MacArthur was</p>

<p>able to modify views expressed by him (your cable 156 29/10/43</p>

<p>[4]) so that Japanese seamen might be included.</p>

<p>Do you think there is any possibility of his doing so? If there</p>

<p>is, it is desirable that his revised opinion should be transmitted</p>

<p>as soon as possible so that immediate action could be taken upon</p>

<p>receipt of the Japanese reply to the communication sent to them</p>

<p>(Dominions Office cable 368) which there is little doubt will be</p>

<p>of negative character.</p>
