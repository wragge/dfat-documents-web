<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Opening of Council meeting today [1] Jessup made very satisfactory statement which was apparently partly result of his discussions with Cochran. He made clear condemnation of Dutch non-compliance with December Resolutions [2] and stated that only possible course for Council now was to stipulate dates for elections for Constituent Assembly and for assumption of sovereignty by U.N.I.</p>

<p>These should be â€˜Matter of monthsâ€™.</p>

<p>Progressive withdrawal of Dutch Forces should, meanwhile, be effected to be complete from whole of Indonesia by final date.</p>

<p>Whole process to be under United Nations supervision.</p>

<p>2. China and Norway spoke on same lines.</p>

<p>3. Full report follows.</p>

<p>4. From private discussions there seems good prospect for Resolution including above main points. Cuba is favourably inclined. United Kingdom informed us their latest instructions were moving also in this direction.</p>

<p>5. We expect to confer with India and United States tomorrow with view to formulation of preliminary draft and will keep you informed. Council meets again Friday.</p>
