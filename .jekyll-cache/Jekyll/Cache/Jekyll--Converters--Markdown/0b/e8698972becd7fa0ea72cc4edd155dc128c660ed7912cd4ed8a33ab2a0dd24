<p>ADELAIDE</p>

<p>At the Annual Conference of the above Association held in Adelaide recently, the following resolution was carried.</p>

<p>â€˜That this Conference views with concern the racial arguments used by self-interested Manufacturing interests whose principal purpose is to shut out mainly the Japanese, and other foreign countriesâ€™ goods, and thus strangle our wool trade with Japan and other countries, who purchase Australian Wool.â€™</p>
