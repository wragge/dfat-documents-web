<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>My telegram 165[A]. [1] In dealing with the prisoners of war question at War Cabinet meeting (my telegram 167[A]) [2], the Prime Minister twice expressed his regret that I had not been at the War Cabinet meeting where the matter was dealt with.</p>

<p>He said that the question was urgent and had had to be dealt with at a meeting of the United Kingdom members summoned to deal with domestic questions.</p>

<p>This was hardly in accord with facts but in view of the handsomeness of the Prime Ministerâ€™s apology-and nobody can do this better when he wants to-I thought it more tactful not to draw attention to this. You can, I think, now regard this episode as closed.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
