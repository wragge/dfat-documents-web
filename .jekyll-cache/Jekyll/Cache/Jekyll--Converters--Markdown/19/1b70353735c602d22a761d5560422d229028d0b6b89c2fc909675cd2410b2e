<p>We are suggesting to Casey [3] on grounds of direct American interest in establishment of landing ground at Noumea in trans- Pacific air line to New Zealand, that United States Government might be prepared to make a public declaration that the maintenance of the status quo in respect of New Caledonia and other French islands in Pacific must be respected.</p>

<p>In meantime, we are arranging for private interests as distinct from direct Government interference, the political significance of which you will appreciate, to endeavour without interference with normal Japanese supplies to secure [sic] output of chrome and nickel does not go to destinations where it can fall into enemy hands.</p>
