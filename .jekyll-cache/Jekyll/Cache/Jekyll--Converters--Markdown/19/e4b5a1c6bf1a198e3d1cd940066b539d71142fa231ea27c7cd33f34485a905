I"¯<p>Cablegram 204 6 April 1941,</p>

<p>Following cablegram has been received by Spender [1] from Blamey [2]:-</p>

<p>â€˜Reference proposal withdraw Australian Units from Lustre for reinforcement Cyrenaica. Have cabled Commander-in-Chief [3] today as follows- BEGINS-In view difficulty maintaining large enemy force in North Africa consider full advantage should be taken of (a) Desert and (b) our amphibious power.</p>

<p>Retention Libya is not vital to defence Egypt however much its loss may affect British prestige.</p>

<p>In Southern Europe the Germans can assemble overwhelming air and land forces much faster than we can.</p>

<p>Unless built up to adequate strength with land and air forces the Imperial Forces in Greece will shortly be in grave peril. ENDS.â€™ This has direct bearing upon my cable of the 5th April No. 202 [4] relating to Wavellâ€™s communique No. 54285. It is I think advisable apart from other considerations to stress need for large additional numbers of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns aeroplanes and tanks. These are given special emphasis in private letter from Mackay [5] which has been sighted by Spender. The reported advance by Germany against Yugo-Slavia and Greece with the possibility of a major thrust by Germany in Libya make imperative most careful appreciation of our position which if miscalculated may well result in disaster to our troops in both areas.</p>
