<p>879. Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Communist China</strong></p>

<p>On 14th July, Communist Chinese Ambassador (Tseng Tao) approached me at French National Day reception to ask about my departure and to wish me well. Soviet Counsellor who was present said that we had been talking about seating of China in United Nations. I commented that we hoped an â€˜appropriate formulaâ€™ could be found on seating of China. Tseng Tao replied that his Government hoped so too but added not on basis of â€˜two Chinas or one China/one Taiwanâ€™.</p>

<p>2. Tseng Tao went on to express hope that relations between Australia and China would be established soon. I asked if he was referring to the recent visit of the Leader of the Opposition to Peking and Tseng Tao replied that China hoped that relations could be established with the Australian Government and not the Opposition.</p>

<p>3. In conversations before Tseng Tao joined us, Soviet Counsellor had expressed belief that formula would be adopted at United Nations which would invite China to be member but he thought majority would be against expulsion of Taiwan. He added that the Chinese would initially refuse such an invitation but might accept next year.</p>

<p>4. Soviet Counsellor also commented that Soviet Union was encouraged by fact that China had not rejected out of hand Soviet proposal for conference of Nuclear Powers. He said that Soviet Union was still waiting for Chinese reply but was hopeful that reply would be positive.</p>
