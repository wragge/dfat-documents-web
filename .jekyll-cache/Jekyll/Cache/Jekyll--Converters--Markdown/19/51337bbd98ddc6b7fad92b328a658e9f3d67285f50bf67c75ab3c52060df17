<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Netherlands Legation advise us that there is no objection to visits by Richardson and Forsyth. Visas will be issued in Canberra. Legation requests that Richardson and Forsyth proceed separately, and this will be done. Will advise movements later, but hope to arrange for Richardson to leave tomorrow Tuesday and reach Batavia about the end of this week.</p>
