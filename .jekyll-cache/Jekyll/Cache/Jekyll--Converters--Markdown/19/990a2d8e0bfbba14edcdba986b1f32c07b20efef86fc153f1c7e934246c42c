<p>Cablegram 507 [1] WASHINGTON, 9 July 1941, 1.10 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister and Minister for External</p>

<p>Affairs.</p>

<p>My telegram No. 502. [2] I saw Sumner Welles [3] today. He</p>

<p>believes that the secret information available and the known</p>

<p>concentration of Japanese naval forces make it evident that the</p>

<p>Japanese have decided on a southward expedition probably in the</p>

<p>next fortnight. He believes the Japanese are pressing Germany to</p>

<p>press Vichy to agree to the Japanese occupation of air and naval</p>

<p>bases in Southern Indo-China. Sumner Welles says that Germany has</p>

<p>not yet agreed so to press Vichy probably because of the effect</p>

<p>that this would have on Weygand [4] in North Africa and on the</p>

<p>French public opinion in France. Japan naturally wants to get</p>

<p>Indo-China by agreement with Vichy and without fighting if</p>

<p>possible but Sumner Welles believes that Japan will take Indo-</p>

<p>China by force if necessary.</p>

<p>Sumner Welles believes that Japan would be content for the present</p>

<p>with Indo-China and some infiltration into Thailand, e.g., go no</p>

<p>further for the present.</p>

<p>If Japan gets Indo-China by agreement with Vichy and without</p>

<p>fighting, Sumner Welles was not prepared to say what the United</p>

<p>States would do. However, if Japan used force he told me that the</p>

<p>United States would place immediate and complete economic and</p>

<p>financial embargo on Japan.</p>

<p>Sumner Welles believes that they and/or we should avoid, as long</p>

<p>as possible, becoming involved in war in the Far East as well as</p>

<p>in Europe, although he clearly has little faith in our being able</p>

<p>to do so for long. He believes that their economic and financial</p>

<p>embargo would provoke Japan to war with them before long.</p>

<p>Sumner Welles is convinced of the uselessness of [their] warning</p>

<p>Japan further. He said that they have made such representations to</p>

<p>Tokyo that it is certain that Tokyo knows â€˜that United States</p>

<p>means businessâ€™.</p>

<p>Sumner Welles admits the possibility that the German hold-up in</p>

<p>Russia and American occupation of Iceland may deter Japan but he</p>

<p>is not hopeful.</p>
