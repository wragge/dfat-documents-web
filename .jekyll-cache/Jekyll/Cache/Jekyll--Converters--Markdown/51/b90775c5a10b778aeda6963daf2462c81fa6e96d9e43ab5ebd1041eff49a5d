<p>SECRET</p>

<p>LEND LEASE.</p>

<p>The President has announced that Lend Lease supplies will be stopped immediately.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is protesting and interpretations of the statement are now being discussed. We shall report further as soon as possible.</p>

<p>At present it seems that Foreign Economic Administration only is involved and not supplies transferred from Military sources.</p>
