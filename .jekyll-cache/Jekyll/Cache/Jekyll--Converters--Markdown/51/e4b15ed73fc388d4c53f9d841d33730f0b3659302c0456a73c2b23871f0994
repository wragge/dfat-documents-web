<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>The attitude set out in the first part of paragraph 2 of your telegram 99 [1] if passed on to The Hague by Teppema has not prevented the assumption of an attitude of injured innocence. I have been already trying to persuade them to see the position and realise that mere cessation of hostilities and United States good offices do not settle anything. The Dutch seem to be thinking of a Committee of ‘disinterested’ countries such as Sweden, Saudi Arabia, China and so far have taken the line that neither the United Kingdom nor Australia are sufficiently impartial to lend good offices. I will continue to try and persuade them that they are wrong.</p>

<p>2. As regards the question of area cleared by the Dutch since hostilities began. As this has to be policed in some way to prevent further destruction, would policing by the Dutch, until such time as a joint Dutch-Indonesian Gendarmerie might take over under the supervision of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Chinese Consuls-General or their representatives, be a satisfactory solution? 3. Suggest no action regarding your paragraph 5 until the result of the talks here known.</p>
