<p>RESTRICTED PERSONAL</p>

<p>Telegram[1] which you have received concerning Economic Development discussions arose out of discussion of the brief which was circulated to Departments. With regard to recommendations made I stressed the large amount of inter-departmental consultation which was initiated by us and you will no doubt bring this point to the Ministerâ€™s attention when recommendations are discussed by Cabinet. With regard to suggestion attributing an order of priority to the various agencies I suggest that this be done on the merits of the particular projects proposed and not merely on the basis of a comparison of one agency with another.</p>

<p>2. I understand there is a view that the I.T.O. be given the main responsibility for co-ordination of the programme. This would cut across the clear functions of the United Nations and I suggest it should be opposed. In any case there cannot be an effective I.T.O. for a couple of years.</p>
