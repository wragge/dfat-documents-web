<p>IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Paragraph 6 of my immediately preceding telegram.</p>

<p>A statement of the Masjumi political council dated November 26th makes the following points:</p>

<p>(a) The Netherlands desire for direct negotiations is a continuation of the old policy of by-passing the Committee. The Committeeâ€™s presence puts the Indonesian question on an international plane whereas the Dutch consider it an internal affair.</p>

<p>(b) Formal negotiations on the basis of the Cochran plan [1] should be resumed as soon as possible under Committee auspices, because direct talks, though informal, have created the impression that the parties are by-passing the Committee.</p>

<p>(c) If such formal negotiations are not shortly initiated the present direct talks may be regarded as a Dutch attempt to delay the matter.</p>

<p>(d) The Political Council urged the Government- (1) to base informal talks on reasonable demands acceptable to the Republican population, (2) to re-affirm that informal talks are of a tentative character and that the Committee must participate in any settlement of the Indonesian question.</p>
