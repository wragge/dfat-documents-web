<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Following the failure of the Chinese resolution in the Security Council [1] the Dutch may be expected to press ahead with their unilateral policy (see para 2 of my K.143 [2]).</p>

<p>2. Through the Prime Minister of East Indonesia a conference will be called for Wednesday next of the leaders of all the Dutch- sponsored negarahs and daerahs of non-Republican territories. The Republic may be invited to send an observer. This conference may be expected to call for liberal powers for a reconstituted provisional government.</p>

<p>3. The Republic will be unlikely to accept the invitation to a conference with representatives of states whose existence they do not recognize. In any case they will be opposed to participation in a provisional government unless there are guarantees of all further stages to complete sovereignty.</p>

<p>4. The Republicâ€™s only course will be an appeal to the Security Council to stop the unliateral policy of the Dutch and to enforce real negotiations.</p>

<p>5. The main hope of a settlement may depend on fitting into our overall proposals provision for a very temporary pre-interim government for the whole of Indonesia which would carry out the tasks contemplated for our commissions.</p>
