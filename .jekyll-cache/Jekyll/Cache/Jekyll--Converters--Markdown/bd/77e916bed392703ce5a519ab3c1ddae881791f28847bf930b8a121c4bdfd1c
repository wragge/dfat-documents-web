<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your JOHCU No. 37. [2]</p>

<p>I send you a minute which has been prepared by the Chiefs of</p>

<p>Staff.</p>

<p>Begins.</p>

<p>It had always been our intention to build up a considerable force</p>

<p>in the Levant-Caspian area this summer in order to provide against</p>

<p>the possibility of a break on the Russian southern flank and a</p>

<p>German advance through the Levant or Persia.</p>

<p>2. The extension of the war to the Far East compelled us-</p>

<p>(a) To divert to Malaya and India three British Divisions (the</p>

<p>18th, 5th and 2nd) from the United Kingdom which would otherwise</p>

<p>have been available for the Middle East.</p>

<p>(b) To return from the Middle East to Australia two out of the</p>

<p>three Australian Divisions.</p>

<p>(c) To send the 70th British Division from the Middle East to</p>

<p>India.</p>

<p>(d) To despatch to Burma and Malaya certain British-Indian</p>

<p>formations which were to have gone to Basra.</p>

<p>(e) To retain in India certain other British-Indian formations</p>

<p>which were similarly destined.</p>

<p>3. As a result the Levant-Caspian front is now almost bare and we</p>

<p>entirely depend for the security of these vital regions on the</p>

<p>Russian front holding. We estimate that even if the Russians were</p>

<p>to break, the Germans could not invade Iraq and Persia in great</p>

<p>strength until the spring of 1943; but if there were little or</p>

<p>nothing there to stop them they could push through with small</p>

<p>forces at a much earlier date.</p>

<p>4. Much depends also upon the result of the battle now raging in</p>

<p>Egypt. If we win it may be possible to divert some of the forces</p>

<p>now fighting in the Western Desert to secure the northern front;</p>

<p>but these will be only a fraction of what is required.</p>

<p>5. We ourselves are doing everything we can to reinforce the</p>

<p>Middle East. The 44th Division is just about to arrive; the 51st</p>

<p>Division arrives next month; and the 56th Division is being</p>

<p>prepared for despatch in August. This will probably be followed by</p>

<p>a further armoured division from this country. In addition we are</p>

<p>prepared to move one or even two divisions from India which is now</p>

<p>less threatened.</p>

<p>6. Even however if General Auchinleck wins his battle and all the</p>

<p>above reinforcements reach their destination there will not be a</p>

<p>man too many in the Middle East as a whole. It is our considered</p>

<p>opinion that to withdraw the 9th Australian Division at the</p>

<p>present time or indeed during this year (1942) would endanger the</p>

<p>safety of the vital Abadan oilfields. Without them we cannot hope</p>

<p>to maintain our position in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Some 60 per cent of Australiaâ€™s oil requirements are supplied from</p>

<p>this source and owing to heavy loss of tankers could not be</p>

<p>brought from elsewhere without the greatest difficulty if at all.</p>

<p>7. Apart from the necessity on strategical grounds for retaining</p>

<p>the well-seasoned 9th Australian Division in the Middle East it</p>

<p>must be remembered that its transportation to Australia, coupled</p>

<p>with the transportation of a division to replace it, would involve</p>

<p>an unjustifiable and dangerous shipping commitment. Minute ends.</p>

<p>Part 2</p>

<p>1. I note the points you make about wastage and the difficulties</p>

<p>you may find in despatching reinforcements from Australia. I very</p>

<p>much hope that you will be able to overcome these difficulties and</p>

<p>keep your fine Division now gaining fresh distinction up to</p>

<p>strength. But should this prove impossible, I suggest that it</p>

<p>would be necessary to fall back upon the expedient of making good</p>

<p>wastage by breaking up ancillary units.</p>
