<p>MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>Your UN.14. Disarmament.</p>

<p>You will have seen our telegram No. 5 which has crossed your UN.</p>

<p>14 and will have noted broad similarity of approach to problem in the two telegrams. I am glad to know your view that Australia has chance to take initiative on this subject which should of course have been taken by Australian Delegation to Assembly.</p>

<p>2. Essence of instructions in our telegram No.5 is that problems raised by U.S.S.R. and U.S. are not mutually exclusive but are co- related and that a parallel approach to these problems should be pursued with vigour.</p>
