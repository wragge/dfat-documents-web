I"<p>Cablegram 15 LONDON, n.d.</p>

<p>PERSONAL FOR CASEY</p>

<p>I am sending copies of two cables I have sent the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>[2]</p>

<p>I doubt whether the U.K. Govt. will take action on my suggestion.</p>

<p>They would I think respond to an initiative from (? the Commonwealth Govt).</p>

<p>Possibly also you can (? do) (en masse?) something with the United States authorities.</p>

<p>Action by United States might stiffen French whose morale I feel will sooner or later inevitably go.</p>
