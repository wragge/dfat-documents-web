<p>PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>My dear P.M.,</p>

<p>INSTALMENT PURCHASE SYSTEM</p>

<p>I do not know if your Trade and Customs Department, or other Commonwealth Department, has made a study of this comparatively new extension of the Credit system.</p>

<p>I started lately to try and find out something about it and enclose some papers as a matter of interest and in case you might have someone looking into the subject for you from the Commonwealth point of view.</p>

<p>By chance, as so often turns out, the last number that has reached me of the Melbourne Stock Exchange Record contained an article on the subject. I find another in the current number of the Midland Bank Monthly Review, both of which I enclose.</p>

<p>I find that the Board of Trade here have made no research into the question, nor, as far as I can find, has any other Government Department.</p>

<p>I am told from several quarters that the only book of any consequence on the subject is a stout two-volume work by Professor Edwin A. Seligman, Professor of Economics in Columbia University (U.S.A.), called, I think, â€˜The Economics of Instalment Sellingâ€™, which deals with the subject from the American viewpoint.</p>

<p>There is a three-page article on the subject in Volume 2 of the three-volume 1926 edition of the â€˜Encyclopaedia Britannicaâ€™, under â€˜Instalment Sellingâ€™, which is well worth reading by anyone studying the question.</p>

<p>I see in the article in the Midland Bank Review that in a future article on the subject they propose to â€˜â€¦ make mention of a far distant new country, Australia, where particularly instructive events have taken placeâ€™. I will send you this when it appears.</p>

<p>[1]</p>

<p>A friend to whom I sent the article from the Melbourne Stock Exchange Record writes:-</p>

<p>On the whole I think the article is sound. My fear is that people will tend to load themselves up too much. A system should be devised that would entail disclosure of all hire purchase obligations when a new one is being entered upon -a tall order, I am afraid! I donâ€™t think it will go far wrong in U.S.A.-so far the statistics for U.S.A. appear quite sound. The arguments regarding Australia do appear to show the need for great caution in developing the business. But I still contend that buying on credit has always been conducted on slipshod lines, and is only another form, and perhaps a less desirable one, of instalment purchase.</p>

<p>After all, does it not seem that the opposition to the system is based on the assumption that it will be abused? I confess that I am apprehensive of the evils that might arise in connection with this method of purchase but we have to bear in mind that, so far as I know, such evils have not actually become apparent. As a general philosophic pronunciamento, I think that in most prognostications in most fields the worst never happens, except in the case of death!</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, R.G. CASEY</p>

<p>_1 Bruce replied in a letter of 30 April 1928 (on file AA:A1420), expressing interest in the concept of hire purchase, but commenting with evident relief that it was constitutionally outside Commonwealth jurisdiction.</p>
