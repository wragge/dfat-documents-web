<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your K.24. [1]</p>

<p>You should make strongest possible appeal to Committee as suggested in your para.5. The Dutch clearly cannot expect to have it both ways; if they still pay lip-service to the Linggadjati Agreement they cannot openly flout it. It can do no harm to threaten strong minority report, and Kirby may instruct you to submit one later in week. Meanwhile you should continue to press along lines of your paras 5 and 7 and keep us fully informed of progress.</p>

<p>2. For your own information we are endeavouring to arrange for Kirby to return in our aircraft before the New Year. I shall discuss your telegram fully with him.</p>
