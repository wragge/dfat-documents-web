<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia.</p>

<p>Your telegram 286 of 10th March [1] was undecipherable until today 11th.</p>

<p>Minister this evening saw Lacy acting chief of Division of Southeast Asian Affairs State Department. Lacy said that U.S.</p>

<p>representative in N.E.I. Foote had telegraphed that National Committee [2] on 5th March had agreed to adopt Cheribon agreement.</p>

<p>This was carried by a large majority with only 2 voting against although there were important abstentions including all members of 2 of the political parties. Lacy added however that Cheribon agreement had been so eaten into by â€˜interpretationsâ€™ that he was doubtful whether it would now be of any value.</p>

<p>He emphasised U.S. Governmentâ€™s deep concern over this question and undertook to get an authoritative opinion and let us have it as a matter of urgency. In the meantime he indicated that in his personal view the U.S. attitude in the event of a breakdown would be substantially the same as your own.</p>
