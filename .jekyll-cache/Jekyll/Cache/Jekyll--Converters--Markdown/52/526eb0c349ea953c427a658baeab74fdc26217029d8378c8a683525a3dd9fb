<p>PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>EXTRACT</p>

<p>One of the most encouraging aspects of Peacockâ€™s visit<a href="#f1">1</a> was the extent to which he himself wanted to defuse Portuguese Timor and withdraw from the somewhat exposed, pro-Fretilin, pro-independence position he had adopted earlier in the year. I discussed Timor with him at some length and lthink he now accepts that an independent Timor is unlikely to be in anyoneâ€™s long-term interests and that Australiaâ€™s present interests are best served by a less obtrusive Australian stance and a measure of political disengagement from the issue.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>On the question of the Consulate, it seems that no news is good news. If, however, the Government does feel obliged to reopen the Consulate-and I suppose that is more or less inevitable-then might I suggest that any announcement of the reopening of the Consulate in Dili be made simultaneously with decision to open a Consulate in Indonesia and possibly in East Malaysia. This would be useful for presentational reasons. I know we have been thinking of a Consulate in Sarawak or Sabah for some time and we have also been thinking of one here in Surabaya, Bali or Medan.</p>

  <li>1 Peacock visited Jakarta late in April, and met both Soeharto and Malik.</li>
  <li>2 Feakes replied, on 14 May, that in his view it was â€˜a major advance that [Peacock] should have modified his views in the way you describedâ€™.</li>
