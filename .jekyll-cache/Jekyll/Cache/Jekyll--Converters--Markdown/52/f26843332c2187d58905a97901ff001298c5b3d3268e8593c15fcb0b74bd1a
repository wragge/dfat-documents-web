<p>In continuation of my telegram No. 76 [1], Sir Horace Wilson [2] referred the matter to the Admiralty and I saw the First Lord [3] and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff [4] this afternoon. They have undertaken to furnish a statement of the position assuming Japan joined in against us at once, but cannot do so before early next week. I said that I wanted to telegraph immediately and asked in the meantime for basis for assumption that Japanese delay in participation to which Lord Stanhope replied as follows.</p>

<p>‘I think it extremely improbable that Japan will come in, owing to commitment in China, the immense distances involved and the grave risk of undertaking such an operation while there is a British fleet in being and there is a possibility of intervention by some other power.’</p>
