<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>Definite information still lacking but my own appreciation is that tank penetration which has crossed the Seine at one point must have been followed by break in line and supporting troops have advanced through the gap. This, however, apparently not main thrust, which appears to be east and west of Soissons. Heavy artillery bombardment has taken place east of this main scene of operations and activity reported as far east as the Maginot Line but of this no details.</p>

<p>In my view early removal of the French Government from Paris likely and if decided on immediately would not mean early collapse of France but probably a decision to fight on even if Paris captured.</p>

<p>De Gaulle who has just been appointed Military Adviser to Reynaud [2] appears to be the strongest and most determined personality who has emerged and possibly he may stiffen both political and military leaders.</p>

<p>Was especially asked not to mention Narvik evacuation till complete. No doubt you understood the hint given in my telegram No. 370. [3]</p>
