<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Reference my immediately preceding telegram. [1]</p>

<p>This is the situation we feared would develop and it is essential that the Secretary-General be informed of the inadequate way in which his message was sent and that he inform the Security Council of the advice he has received making a point that, if Indonesian hostilities do not cease everywhere at midnight tonight, this would in no way prejudice their position.</p>

<p>Moreover the Secretary-General should, as we have already suggested [2], immediately despatch an observer and request the Dutch or some other power, including ourselves, to assist by the supply of aircraft acting under Security Council authority to drop pamphlets or take any other action which might be required both to observe the facts and to facilitate the carrying out of the decision.</p>
