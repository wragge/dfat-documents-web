<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your UN.707. [1] Am trying to phone you. Feel that whole success of case depends upon not prejudging issue. We are not condemning the Dutch for acting. We only ask for cessation of hostilities. An order to the Dutch to return to July 19 positions would weaken this. We ask for a cessation of hostilities so that independent arbitration can decide merits and further destruction of life and property be avoided.</p>

<p>2. However you must use discretion if without such amendment resolution is in danger of being vetoed. If there is any chance of United States and United Kingdom support it may be possible to support amendment still without prejudging issue.</p>
