<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Security 446.</p>

<p>Your 472 [1] and related messages. Indonesia.</p>

<p>Position following on private consultation with most members of Security Council is as follows- 1. United Kingdom, Belgium and France will object strenuously to any further action by Council and still maintain original decision of 1st August was outside competence of Council.</p>

<p>2. Brazil despite your representation [2] has received instructions generally to support the United States view that it would be unwise for Council to appoint a Commission of arbitrators until we knew the results of the United States good offices which they hoped would develop into mediation and measures for full settlement.</p>

<p>3. United States opposed to joint arbitration or mediation with Australia at this stage. They also object strenuously to our proposal for a Commission of five to ensure the decision of Council regarding observing and reporting on â€˜cease fireâ€™ is observed. They argue you cannot avoid appointing Soviet or satellite representative on any such Commission and the results will be the same as in the Greek question.</p>

<p>4. Only positive and constructive suggestion from Colombia. He proposes that our resolutions [be] amended to provide for a recommendation that United States â€˜good officesâ€™ now accepted by both parties should in first instance be directed to obtaining mutual acceptance by both parties to the appointment of three arbitrators.</p>

<p>5. Bearing in mind the general decision that we should not court rebuff in Council we are of the opinion that at this stage we cannot secure sufficient votes to carry a positive resolution for appointment of Commission of three arbitrators. Even if we managed to secure seven votes possibility of veto [by] United Kingdom &amp;</p>

<p>France cannot be excluded.</p>

<p>6. As it is we shall have difficulty in securing passage of the resolution as set out in our 747 [3] and 751. [4] In the circumstances the best tactics would appear to be to hear the statement of the Indonesian delegate with his request for a Commission of three arbitrators and accept amendment vide paragraph 4 which Colombia would be prepared to advance thus avoiding withdrawal of our proposal and substitution by a new resolution.</p>
