<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia. [1]</p>

<p>The Security Council should retain general jurisdiction without prejudice to the matter being raised in the Assembly under the Assembly’s security powers.</p>

<p>2. Australia should be included in any formula for mediation or arbitration. I have no doubt that Indonesia will insist on this because of our initiative and danger of the Security Council being side-tracked.</p>

<p>3. I agree that it is important in Australia’s interests that we must carefully watch and I doubt whether one man can continue to represent us to both parties as at present.</p>
