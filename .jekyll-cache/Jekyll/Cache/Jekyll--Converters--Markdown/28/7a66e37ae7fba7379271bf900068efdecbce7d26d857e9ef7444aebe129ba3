<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In view of forthcoming location of 2nd A.I.F. in Palestine for completion training and equipment with modem weapons we should be glad to have earliest possible an appreciation of military situation in Near and Middle East. In particular we should like information as to possible employment of Australian troops in those theatres either on active operations or temporarily on internal security duties in relief of more fully trained British troops. We should be grateful also for information as to anticipated rate of provision of modern weapons and equipment for 2nd A.I.F. [1]</p>
