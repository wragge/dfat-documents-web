<p>PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Bruce,</p>

<p>This is the fourth letter I have written to you by this mail.</p>

<p>My copy of â€˜Forwardâ€™, the Scottish Labour paper, has just arrived and I feel sure you will like to see the statements made by Mr.</p>

<p>MacDonald [1] and by Mr. Wheatley [2] on the General Strike.</p>

<p>The contrast is vivid. Personally I prefer Wheatleyâ€™s attitude to that of MacDonald. The latter appears to be trying to bluff both himself and his readers.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL</p>

<p>_1 Ramsay MacDonald, Leader of the Labour Opposition.</p>

<p>2 John Wheatley, Labour M.P.; Minister of Health 1924.</p>

<p>_</p>
