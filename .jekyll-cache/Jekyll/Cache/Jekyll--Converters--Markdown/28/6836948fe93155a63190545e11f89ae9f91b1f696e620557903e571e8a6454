I"O<p>Cablegram 7 BATAVIA, 17 February 1946, 12.25 a.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>Many thanks for your message of 16th February [1] which has crossed one I sent to you through London.</p>

<p>I understand your difficulties, but I am bound to say that I must adhere to the views specified in my message. It seems that there must be some misunderstanding about the attitude of the Netherlands Minister, because I gather from Dr. van Mook that he has received specific instructions from the British and from the Netherlands Government to ask that movement of the 700 Indonesians be delayed.</p>

<p>So far as we here are concerned it is most important that these men should not arrive until the first stages of the negotiations are over and I again beg you to be so good as to arrange this. It occurs to me that, as the vessel has already left Sydney, a way out of this difficulty might be found by slowing up her voyage in such a way that she does not reach Batavia until the third week in March.</p>
