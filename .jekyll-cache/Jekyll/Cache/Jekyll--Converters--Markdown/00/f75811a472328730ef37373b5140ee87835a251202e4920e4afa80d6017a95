<p>Chinese Representation</p>

<p>Minister has approved our general approach in the immediate future to the question of Chinese representation as given below.</p>

<p>2. This approval is within the context of our current policy objectives as follows:</p>

<p>(a) We shall seek to normalise our relations with the PRC,</p>

<p>(b) We should support entry of the PRC to the United Nations and allocation to it of the Security Council seat,</p>

<p>(c) We should seek to retain membership of the United Nations for the ROC if it so desires, and thus oppose any proposals for its expulsion.</p>

<p>3. We should bear in mind the element of inconsistency between the first and third of these objectives, the fluidity of the general situation, our fundamental longâ€“term interest in normalised relations with the PRC and our consequent desire to avoid either international isolation or conspicuous association with a diplomatic defeat on the Chinese representation issue. As a consequence, our policy should still be regarded as completely open, because we may need to make some rapid lastâ€“minute changes if we are to protect and advance our own national interest to the maximum.</p>

<p>4. Against this background, the Minister has approved:</p>

<p>[ <em>matter omitted</em> ]<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>5. We shall be sending in the next safe hand bag a copy of the submission on which the foregoing approval is based.</p>

<p><em>For UN New York</em></p>

<p>6. You should use the above, as appropriate, in confidential discussions with our friends. Subâ€“paragraph 4(x) will give you general guidance for meeting of 17 August. You should know our view that a decision on Australian coâ€“sponsorship of the inscription of a new item on Chinese Representation should only be made:</p>

<p>(a) after we have seen the text of the explanatory memorandum, and</p>

<p>(b) after we know which countries are prepared to join as coâ€“sponsors.</p>

<p>We should be grateful for your report on 17 August meeting, and for reports on any other discussions with our friends which you might have as opportunity offers.</p>

<p><em>For Washington, Wellington, Tokyo</em></p>

<p>7. You might use the above as opportunity offers, bearing in mind the cautious approach which the Minister has directed that we pursue. Please report as appropriate reactions of officials of Government to which you are accredited.</p>

<p><em>For Taipei</em></p>

<p>8. The above is for your background information only at this stage.</p>

<p>[NAA: A1838, 3107/38/18, xix]</p>

<p>1 Matter omitted accords in substance with the recommendations contained in the latter part of Document 237.</p>
