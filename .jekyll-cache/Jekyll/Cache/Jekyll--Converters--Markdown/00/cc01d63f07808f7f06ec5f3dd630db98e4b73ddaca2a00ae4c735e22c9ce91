<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Addressed to the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin.</p>

<p>War Crimes Commission. Dominions Office telegram [D.182] of 7th February. [2]</p>

<p>In your telegram 3 of 7th January [3] you acquiesced in the proposed course of action suggested in telegram D.No. [1077] of 8th December. [4] Notwithstanding this the United Kingdom have adopted an entirely different course [5] without any notification to you until the action has been taken. While in the present case I do not think any particular harm has been done, a very important principle is involved. I have accordingly offered a strong protest and warned the United Kingdom that a repetition of this sort of thing will inevitably lead to serious trouble.</p>

<p>While I think we can let the episode pass with my protest, a telegram from you if you felt so disposed would have a salutary effect.</p>
