<p>IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>We have received through United Kingdom Government the proposal for a joint public appeal to Chinese Government to spare Shanghai needless destruction. While agreeing that Foreign Representatives on the spot should do all they can to persuade Chinese Authorities not to let Shanghai be destroyed, Prime Minister sees disadvantages in a public appeal, and has advised United Kingdom High Commissioner accordingly. Minister in New York has also been informed.</p>
