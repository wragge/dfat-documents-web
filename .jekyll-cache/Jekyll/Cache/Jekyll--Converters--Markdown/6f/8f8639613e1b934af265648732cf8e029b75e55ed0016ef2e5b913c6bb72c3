I"Ç<p>Cablegram 226 CANBERRA, 2 July 1942</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Please have the following message transmitted to the British</p>

<p>Ambassador, Kuibyshev. [1] Begins:-</p>

<p>Would be glad if you would communicate personally following</p>

<p>message to M. Molotov [2] from me:-</p>

<p>While in London in May you will recall I discussed with you and</p>

<p>your Ambassador in London the completion of an agreement in</p>

<p>principle for the exchange of diplomatic representatives between</p>

<p>the Soviet and the Commonwealth. You will recall in this</p>

<p>connection that you expressed yourself as personally favourable to</p>

<p>the agreement but desired the matter to wait until you could</p>

<p>obtain approval from M. Stalin. In our view the time has now come</p>

<p>for the announcement of an agreement in principle for exchange of</p>

<p>ministers following the example of Canada leaving the question of</p>

<p>appointment etc. to be determined later. I hope you will treat</p>

<p>this as an earnest of our desire for continuance of present</p>

<p>cordial relationships between our countries. It is many months</p>

<p>since we first suggested exchange and further delay would be a</p>

<p>matter for regret. I trust Your Excellency would be good enough to</p>

<p>regard this matter as one deserving of your early consideration.</p>

<p>[3] With kindest regards and best wishes.</p>

<p>EVATT</p>

<p>Kuybyshev on the Volga River.</p>

<p>2 Soviet Foreign Minister. Evatt also sent a message in similar</p>

<p>terms to I. M. Maisky, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>See cablegram 225 of 2 July on file AA: A981, Soviet Russia 44.</p>

<p>3 Molotov replied on 19 July that the Soviet Govt agreed in</p>

<p>principle to an exchange of diplomatic representatives but did not</p>

<p>want a public announcement until the names of the ministers had</p>

<p>been decided on. Evatt pressed for an immediate announcement, but</p>

<p>Molotov refused to agree. See cablegrams S66 of 23 July, SL44 of</p>

<p>24 July and S87 of 22 August on the file cited in note 2.</p>
