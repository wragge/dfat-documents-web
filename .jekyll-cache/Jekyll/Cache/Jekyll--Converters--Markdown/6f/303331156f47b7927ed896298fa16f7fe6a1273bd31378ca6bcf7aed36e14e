<p>On 11th July ‘Antara’ reported President Sukarno as saying at a meeting commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Catholic Party that the Indonesian Government had definite proof that Tunku Abdul Rahman had signed an agreement with the British on the formation of Malaysia.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, clear that the Tunku had not kept his word for it had been agreed upon in Tokyo and Manila that Malaysia would not be formed before the will of the people in the territories was ascertained. President Sukarno again emphasized that the Indonesian people were not only in disagreement with the Federation, but would oppose it. He added that the proposed tripartite summit meeting had now become a doubtful matter with this break of promise by the Tunku. He would not remain silent, and the Indonesian people would disapprove if he kept silence over the Tunku’s act.</p>

<p>Sukarno called for close unity among Indonesian people in opposing proposed federation of Malaysia.</p>
