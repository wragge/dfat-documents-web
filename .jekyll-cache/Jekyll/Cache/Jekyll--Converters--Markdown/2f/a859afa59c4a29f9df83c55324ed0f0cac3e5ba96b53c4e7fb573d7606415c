<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations.</p>

<p>I feel strongly that Australian representative should be present at talks as Australiaâ€™s interest in the settlement is in my opinion greater than that of the United Kingdom and Australia should be represented as such because of the primary part that we played in the Pacific struggle against Japan.</p>

<p>Until this can be arranged request you should take with you as your associate in all talks, Mr Ballard, Australian Political Representative, Batavia. Ends.</p>
