<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Commonwealth of Australia telegram 313 of 23rd May [1] paragraph 3, and New Zealand telegram 192 of 21st May paragraph 2. [2]</p>

<p>The views of the American-Dutch-British Conference on strength of United States Pacific Fleet have been noted, though it might be observed that in making this recommendation the American-Dutch- British Conference went outside their terms of reference (see paragraph 4(b) of my telegram 11th April C. of A. 248, N.Z. 135 [3[).</p>

<p>Our view when considering the United States suggestion for the transfer of substantial proportion of their capital ships to the Atlantic was that such a move was likely to have political effect which would outweigh purely strategic considerations.</p>
