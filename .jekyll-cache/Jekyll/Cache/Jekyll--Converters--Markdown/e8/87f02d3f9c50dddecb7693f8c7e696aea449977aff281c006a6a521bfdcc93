I"n<p>Cablegram Johcu 37 (extracts) CANBERRA, 16 July 1942</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>1. You will recall from cablegram No. 245 of 14th April [1] that</p>

<p>the Government expressed the view that all Australian troops</p>

<p>abroad should be returned to Australia, but it was prepared to</p>

<p>agree to the postponement of the return of the 9th Division until</p>

<p>it could be replaced in the Middle East and the necessary shipping</p>

<p>could be provided.</p>

<p>[A statistical summary of Australian troops in the Middle East has</p>

<p>been omitted.]</p>

<p>5. It will be noted that the reinforcements available provide for</p>

<p>only one and a half monthsâ€™ wastage on the basis of intense</p>

<p>activity. When these are exhausted the Division, if still engaged</p>

<p>in active operations, will have to be withdrawn from the line of</p>

<p>battle. If it were to remain in action with units of reduced</p>

<p>strength, its morale would be affected. Alternatively, it might be</p>

<p>maintained at strength by breaking up units of Corps troops, Base</p>

<p>and L. of C. [2] organisations. This would also create discontent.</p>

<p>6. In view of the original decision for the return of the A.I.F.</p>

<p>to Australia, I foresee considerable difficulties in the despatch</p>

<p>of further reinforcements from Australia. Most of the A.I.F. have</p>

<p>returned and are at battle stations, the two brigades from Ceylon</p>

<p>are en route and the general expectation is that the 9th Division</p>

<p>is also to come. Also, as stated in paragraph 5 of cablegram No.</p>

<p>245, the 9th Division cannot be retained abroad indefinitely</p>

<p>without its morale being affected.</p>

<p>7. Notwithstanding the respite granted by the Coral Sea action, it</p>

<p>is possible, though I know you do not think it probable, for Japan</p>

<p>to invade Australia in force until superiority in naval and air</p>

<p>power is established in the Pacific.</p>

<p>8. Had Japan been an enemy in 1939, the needs of Australian</p>

<p>Defence and the campaign in the Pacific would not have permitted</p>

<p>troops from Australia proceeding beyond Malaya. I now think, from</p>

<p>all points of view, that the concentration of the A.I.F. in</p>

<p>Australia for home defence and for participation with our American</p>

<p>Allies in offensive action against Japan, when this becomes</p>

<p>possible, is the best manner in which we can cooperate. We are</p>

<p>also continuing our part in the Empire Air Training Scheme, in</p>

<p>which we have 8,000 personnel abroad. In addition, we are manning</p>

<p>certain ships and supplying personnel to the Royal Navy, the</p>

<p>present number being 2,700.</p>

<p>9. I am putting the matter frankly to you in a personal manner.</p>

<p>With the 9th Division in action the subject must arise in the</p>

<p>immediate future, and I would like to have your views before it is</p>

<p>considered by War Cabinet.</p>
