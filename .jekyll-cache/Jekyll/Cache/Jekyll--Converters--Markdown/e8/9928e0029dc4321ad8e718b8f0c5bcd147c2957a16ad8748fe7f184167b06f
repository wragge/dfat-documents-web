<p>Cablegram M81 LONDON, 25 April 1941, 7.20 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 164 of 26th March [1] and Casey’s 21 to me of 12th March [2] regarding landing rights.</p>

<p>I have now discussed the matter with the appropriate British authorities and it has been agreed that Pan-American Airways might be given landing rights in Australia for their Trans-Pacific service if the following arrangements can be made:-</p>

<p>(1) Reciprocal landing rights at Honolulu and San Francisco to be made available to the Commonwealth Government for a British service from the date of the first flight to Australia by Pan- American Airways even though we might not be in a position to make use of them until after the war.</p>

<p>(2) The position of New Zealand to be safeguarded by stipulating that Pan-American Airways should undertake to operate alternates flights to an Australian and a New Zealand terminal (as proposed by Mr. Casey).</p>

<p>(3) The position at Noumea to be satisfactorily clarified and since Pan-American Airways’ rights are not exclusive this should present no difficulty.</p>

<p>(4) That all negotiations should take place as between the Governments (i.e. with the State Department at Washington) and that direct discussions with Pan-American Airways should be avoided.</p>

<p>(5) That the matters should be so handled that the initiative would come not from the Commonwealth Government but from the United States Government.</p>

<p>It might [for example] [4] be possible that when next the Commonwealth Minister at Washington was approached on the matter by the State Department he should ask that a communication should be made to him in writing putting forward a definite proposal.</p>

<p>If you agree with these proposals would you please consult with the New Zealand Government and if they are acceptable to them I will take up the matter with Casey.</p>
