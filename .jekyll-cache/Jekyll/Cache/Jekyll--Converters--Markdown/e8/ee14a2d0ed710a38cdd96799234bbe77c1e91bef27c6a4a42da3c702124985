I"é<p>Cabinet Office, London, 27 November 1974</p>

<p>Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Visit of Mr Whitlam</strong></p>

<p>I attach a proposed outline of objectives for your discussion with Mr Whitlam on 19thâ€“20th December, together with an assessment of his objectives. I would suggest that at your first meeting it would be useful to concentrate discussion on four broad themesâ€“</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The world economic situation (including inflation, petro-dollars and energy) and the domestic policies, including our respective social contracts, which each country is adopting in the light of it.</p>

  <p>(b) The EEC renegotiation.</p>

  <p>(c) The development of dÃ©tente and East/West relations generally.</p>

  <p>(d) The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Kingston next April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. The second meeting could be used for the discussion of bilateral issues, including food and raw materials supplies, trade and investment, British defence policy, Australian constitutional issues and a variety of United Nations questions on which Australian attitudes are different from yours.</p>

<p>3. I understand that this approach is likely to be acceptable to Mr. Whitlam (there appears now to be no suggestion that he should attend a full Cabinet meeting). If you are content, I will arrange for briefs on the lines set out below, including defensive material, to be available to you by 14th December.</p>

<p><strong>Outline of Objectives for Prime Ministerâ€™s Meeting with Mr Whitlam 19thâ€”20th December, 1974</strong></p>

<p><em>Section A: United Kingdom Objectives</em></p>

<p>There is no single overriding objective on our side. Mr Whitlam will be coming on a wider European tour (including Brussels, Bonn and Moscow, but not Paris) and plans to spend Christmas here with his family. Our principal purpose should beâ€“</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) To see established a good working relationship between the Prime Minister and Mr Whitlam, who will be meeting for the first time as Heads of Government, and to build on the concepts and ideas their Governments have in common.</p>

  <p>(2) To review world economic and financial prospects, with particular reference to the need to find collective solutions to the interrelated problems of the avoidance of world recession, global inflation, energy supplies and costs, and the handling of oil producersâ€™ financial surpluses.</p>

  <p>(3) To discuss the implications of the world economic situation for the two countries; to compare our respective domestic approaches, including our social contracts; and to stress the underlying strength of the United Kingdom economy.</p>

  <p>(4) To explain United Kingdom policy towards the European Communityâ€”in particular our objectives and the current position in the context of renegotiation.</p>

  <p>(5) To explore the possibility of improvements in our economic links and trade with Australia (one of our priority exports markets), including the question of access for Australian food exports to the United Kingdom (as members of the EEC or, alternatively, if we come out).</p>

  <p>(6) To enquire about the development of Australian policies on natural resources (including producer co-operation) and on overseas investment in Australia, with a view to identifying possible fields for co-operation, especially in energy and notably in uranium procurement and uranium enrichment technology.</p>

  <p>(7) To discuss the development of dÃ©tente and related issues, and the extent to which the Russians are serious, in the particular context of Mr Whitlamâ€™s visit to Moscow in January and the Prime Ministerâ€™s own proposed later visit there.</p>

  <p>(8) To explain our thinking on future defence policy.</p>

  <p>(9) To discuss the role of the Commonwealth (of which Mr Whitlam is a firm supporter); the two Governmentsâ€™ objectives at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April, and related matters, e.g. the appointment of the Commonwealth Secretary General.</p>

  <p>(10) To explain our views on other international matters as appropriate, e.g. African questions especially Southern Africa, arms limitation, and nuclear matters generally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Section B: Mr Whitlamâ€™s Objectives</em></p>

<p>Mr Whitlam will probably not wish to have a formal agenda. He may prefer, in addition to any larger meetings, to have relaxed and informal conversations with the Prime Minister. However, he has already said that he wants to raise the following two matters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the residual links between Australian State Governments and the Crown through United Kingdom Ministers, and, possibly, other constitutional issues;</p>

  <p>(2) the institution of an Australian system of honours, although he now understands that he should discuss this direct with the Palace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr Whitlam is also likely to want to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) explain the new and more independent foreign policy which he has initiated, particularly in South East Asia and the Pacific;</p>

  <p>(4) enquire about specific aspects of our defence policy (Five Power Defence Arrangements, Diego Garcia, Simonstown) and in this context in particular;</p>

  <p>(5) put forward Australian ideas on super-power restraint in the Indian Ocean against the background of the Indian Ocean Peace Zone proposals;</p>

  <p>(6) explain his views on nuclear matters, notably nuclear testing, non-proliferation and nuclear-free zones;</p>

  <p>(7) discuss world energy problems;</p>

  <p>(8) (possibly) explain Australiaâ€™s new visa requirements for United Kingdom nationals. There is no scope for any joint public activity (e.g. the signature of an agreement or announcement of some project).</p>
