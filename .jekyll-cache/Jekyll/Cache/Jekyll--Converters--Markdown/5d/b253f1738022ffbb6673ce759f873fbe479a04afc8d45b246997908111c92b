<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>1. Indonesian Prime Minister has accepted our proposal. [1]</p>

<p>2. Position is clear. Dutch have accepted American mediation.</p>

<p>Indonesians have virtually rejected it by requesting good offices be used to secure arbitration. Indonesians have accepted idea of joint American-Australian arbitration.</p>

<p>3. There is no reasonable alternative and you might consider hav[ing] case put at Washington to support your endeavours at New York. In view of Beasley’s telegram [2] and of Indonesian acceptance of our proposal there is no point in pressing idea of three parties.</p>

<p>4. Minister [3] wants you to be on your guard to restore the authority of the United Nations, at the same time being careful not to risk a public rebuff. The line we are adopting should achieve both objectives.</p>
