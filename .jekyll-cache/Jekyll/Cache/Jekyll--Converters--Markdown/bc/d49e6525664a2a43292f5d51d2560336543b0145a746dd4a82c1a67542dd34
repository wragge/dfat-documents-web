<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram No. 254. [1] Foreign Office advise today 13th July that decision has been reached to defer the question until the Autumn unless fresh circumstances arise in the meantime which will necessitate a decision being made. The United Kingdom Government will therefore continue for the time being to accord diplomatic status to Czechoslovak Legation, London and the position of Czech Consul in this country also remains unaltered.</p>
