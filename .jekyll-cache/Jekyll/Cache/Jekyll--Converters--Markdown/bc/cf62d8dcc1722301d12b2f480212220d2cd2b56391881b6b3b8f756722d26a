<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Reparations.</p>

<p>Following reply to your telegram P15 [1] is forwarded after discussions between the Resident Minister, the Dominions Office, Walker and Cochrane.</p>

<p>1. There is no indication that value of patents and industrial processes will be taken into account as part of our share of reparations.</p>

<p>2. Value of expropriated enemy property in Australia will be deducted from the Australian share under Category A. See final act Paris Conference part one Article One paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) and Article 6.</p>

<p>3. The Australian share in category (b) will probably be between three and six million pounds sterling. As stated above value of expropriated property is normally charged against Category (a) and not category See Cochraneâ€™s report dated 18th sent by hand with Gray, Mr. Makinâ€™s Secretary.</p>

<p>4. our right to share in processes and patents is not limited in any way by our signing the agreement.</p>

<p>5. The meeting in Brussels on 28th is a meeting of members of Reparations Assembly and not a Conference. Only those who have signed the agreement and paid their contributions can participate.</p>

<p>6. While delay of a few days after 28th may not exclude Australia from participation in the reparations plan it would place us at an initial disadvantage and would probably preclude the Australian Delegate from serving on any sub-committees since these will be elected at the initial meeting between the 28th and the 5th March.</p>

<p>Strongly urge Australia sign before 28th.</p>
