<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 38. [1] Indonesia. Minister for Foreign Affairs is not available until Tuesday next when I arranged to see him.</p>

<p>2. There is general dissatisfaction here at the slowness of negotiations for which the Republic is blamed. I understand that the United Kingdom Consul General at Bataviaâ€™s reports support the view that negotiations are being delayed by Republican prevarication and that he has recommended pressure on them.</p>

<p>3. You will appreciate that the steps proposed in the last paragraph of your telegram would arouse very deep resentment here and be regarded as a partisan measure contrary to our position as members of the Good Offices Commission. They would be liable to jeopardize the present good hope of full Dutch co-operation in Japanese treaty negotiations.</p>
