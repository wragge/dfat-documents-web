<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 19. [1]</p>

<p>I appreciate that Secretary-General must be consulted but hope it can be done quickly for time is short and I believe a very early statement on lines suggested in my telegram 44 might tip the balance.</p>

<p>2. I am doing what I can here to emphasize that we are staying with Acting President to try and help him to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>3. I do not think sending of a Liaison Officer to Canton affects the position. It is doing no more than maintaining contact with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he can be withdrawn at any moment.</p>
