<p>IMPORTANT TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Reference my telegram No. 136.</p>

<p>The first reaction of the Netherlands Government to Cochran proposals was a long juristic document suggesting modifications to almost every clause. On second and wiser thoughts they reduced their objections to two, viz.</p>

<p>(1) the impossibility at present of holding elections to select a constituent body and (2) the need for stronger control over foreign relations.</p>

<p>2. Now they have gone a step further and decided to accept the proposals, in the same way as the Republic, as a basis for discussion and to put forward the modifications they propose.</p>

<p>3. I think there is, after a far too long delay, a real chance, with the assistance of the Committee of Good Offices, to secure an agreement.</p>

<p>4. But when the Secretary General advised me of para 2. this morning, he emphasised that time was short for reports indicate that disorder is increasing every day.</p>
