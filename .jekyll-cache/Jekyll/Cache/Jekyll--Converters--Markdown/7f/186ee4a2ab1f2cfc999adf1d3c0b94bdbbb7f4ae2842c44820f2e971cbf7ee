<p>MOST IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Cochran claims that he has not been sold a bill of goods by the Dutch and that he is in Indonesia to see that the Councilâ€™s resolution [1] is implemented. At the same time, he warns that a critical report of the Dutch Parliament may cause the fall of the Cabinet and seriously jeopardise the Commission work in Indonesia.</p>

<p>I have prepared a draft report which brings out strongly the Dutch non-compliance and refers the problem to the Security Council. I believe that Cochran might want to water this down and that Herremans will agree.</p>

<p>I should be glad of immediate instructions as to whether in this event I should maintain a minority position.</p>
