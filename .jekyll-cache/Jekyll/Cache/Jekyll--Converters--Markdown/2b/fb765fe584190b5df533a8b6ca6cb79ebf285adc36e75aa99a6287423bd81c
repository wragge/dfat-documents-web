I"‹<p>Cablegram 2196 CANBERRA, 23 July 1941</p>

<p>Clappâ€™s [1] telegram 2597 of 19th July.</p>

<p>We cannot understand United States request that Commonwealth</p>

<p>Government should retain title to all material procured through</p>

<p>Lease Lend. Goods to be obtained for non-government use may be</p>

<p>classified into:</p>

<p>(a) durable equipment for industry,</p>

<p>(b) materials raw or partially manufactured for further</p>

<p>manufacture in Australia,</p>

<p>(c) commodities ready for final consumption.</p>

<p>It would be possible, though inconvenient, for the Government to</p>

<p>retain the title to goods falling in the first class. In this case</p>

<p>the equipment would have to be hired to the users. A charge of</p>

<p>some sort would clearly be essential if user was not to be given</p>

<p>unfair advantage over competitors. Moreover in case of supply of</p>

<p>parts, e.g., locomotive equipment, cost of incorporation may</p>

<p>exceed cost of equipment and in any case Railway Department would</p>

<p>probably refuse to accept such goods on basis of title remaining</p>

<p>with Commonwealth. Although system of hiring equipment would be</p>

<p>possible it would be administratively difficult and we would much</p>

<p>prefer to have the right to sell the equipment outright to the</p>

<p>user devoting the proceeds to war purposes as outlined in my cable</p>

<p>to Dominions Office of which you have Copy. [2]</p>

<p>Materials for further manufacture in Australia would be for:</p>

<p>(a) contractors producing for Government and</p>

<p>(b) manufacturers producing for sale to public.</p>

<p>It would be possible to retain the title to materials issued to</p>

<p>contractors. These materials could be issued without charge,</p>

<p>contract prices being made up excluding the cost of materials so</p>

<p>issued. We are certain, however, that this method is wasteful and</p>

<p>likely to lead to fraud. In our view proper control and economy</p>

<p>can be obtained only by charging contractors for materials issued</p>

<p>and debiting the cost against the final amount due to them. If</p>

<p>finished goods were subsequently forwarded to Middle East, India</p>

<p>or Singapore fronts it might be impossible or impracticable for</p>

<p>Commonwealth to retain title, e.g., cotton drill made into</p>

<p>uniforms.</p>

<p>It appears to us to be impracticable to retain the title to</p>

<p>materials being manufactured for consumption by the public. If</p>

<p>they were issued free of charge to manufacturers it would lead to</p>

<p>differential prices for similar commodities to consumers which</p>

<p>would be impossible to police. In case of durable goods title</p>

<p>could perhaps be retained on basis of annual rental charge. We</p>

<p>would strongly prefer to avoid this as Lease Lend Clearing House</p>

<p>would probably develop into Hire Purchase Collecting Office.</p>

<p>The foregoing difficulties apply equally to goods for final</p>

<p>consumption. Generally speaking we feel that both these classes</p>

<p>must be sold to commercial users at approximately commercial</p>

<p>prices if the administrative problem is to be kept within bounds.</p>

<p>We took previous requests that distribution should not be on a</p>

<p>profit basis to mean that where agents were employed to distribute</p>

<p>goods to commercial users such agents were to be remunerated on a</p>

<p>payment for services basis. We understood that United Kingdom</p>

<p>proposed to seek U.S. approval for the sale of goods (other than</p>

<p>those for direct use by the Government) acquired under Lease Lend</p>

<p>by the Government to the commercial users whether for manufacture</p>

<p>or for sale to the public on the ordinary commercial basis. (See</p>

<p>D.O. cables 334 [3] para. 7C and 445 [4] para. 3D.) We have made</p>

<p>our plans accordingly. This view is confirmed in cable received</p>

<p>yesterday from Bruce [5] which he despatched after consultation</p>

<p>with United Kingdom Treasury officials.</p>

<p>We are anxious to meet United States requirements in every way</p>

<p>possible but suggest that you consult with United Kingdom</p>

<p>representatives on this question. In view of United Kingdom</p>

<p>obtaining foodstuffs and other consumption goods under Lease Lend</p>

<p>we cannot see how they can administer their distribution on the</p>

<p>basis of the Government retaining title to all materials obtained</p>

<p>under Lease Lend.</p>

<p>Please advise us of United Kingdom views and urge upon them</p>

<p>strongly the necessity for seeking U.S.A. approval for</p>

<p>distribution on a more practicable basis.</p>

<p>Your telegram raises questions:</p>

<p>(a) whether there are any other British Supply Council</p>

<p>instructions of which we should know,</p>

<p>(b) whether it is agreed that these instructions should apply to</p>

<p>the Dominions,</p>

<p>(c) whether the instructions are drawn up primarily to meet</p>

<p>conditions obtaining in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Would appreciate earliest possible replies to this and my telegram</p>

<p>of 22nd as plans for Clearing House are vitally affected. [6]</p>
