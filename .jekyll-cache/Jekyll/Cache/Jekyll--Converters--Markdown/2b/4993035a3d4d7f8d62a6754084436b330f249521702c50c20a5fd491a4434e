<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Regarding wool and other primary products which are subjects of sale to Great Britain, and also Shipping, I propose to send McBride [1] to London with suitable assistants and possibly Owen Dixon [2] who has been advising Wool Committee.</p>

<p>My reason is that there is good deal of criticism at this end which I think cannot be adequately met unless we can show that we have done everything possible to eliminate the causes of criticism.</p>

<p>Unnecessary for me to say that your own efforts fully appreciated by us but you will at once realise the political significance of sending a special delegation in matters of such moment to Australian pastoralists and farmers.</p>

<p>We have not received any reply regarding our desire for direct representation with Ministry for Economic Warfare. [3] We attach great importance to this. I am considering whether it might not be a good thing to get a man of the standing of Owen Dixon to go to London for this purpose.</p>

<p>Would be grateful if you could let me have your comments as early as possible.</p>

<p>MENZIES</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for Commerce.</p>

<p>2 Justice, of the High Court of Australia.</p>

<p>3 See Document 120.</p>
