I"¯<p>Cablegram 4575 CANBERRA, 21 October 1949</p>

<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Your 4370. [1]</p>

<p>Minister has discussed this question with Netherlands Minister [2] and previously considered it when raised at Round Table Conference.</p>

<p>Dutch New Guinea has never been regarded by us as forming part of Indonesia as demonstrated by inclusion of Dutch New Guinea in area of South Pacific Commission.</p>

<p>Dutch trusteeship has always, in our view, been best solution. Any attempt to force the issue along lines United Kingdom propose â€˜for the presentâ€™ might easily result in territory going completely outside any form of Dutch control.</p>

<p>For your information, before receipt of your 4370 Minister had already conveyed these views informally to Netherlands Minister.</p>

<p>Please pass confidentially to The Hague.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Dispatched on 20 October, it reported that the Netherlands Ambassador in London had suggested to the UK Government that West New Guinea be placed under a Netherlands trusteeship but that the UK Government had indicated that it preferred not to change the status quo.</p>
