<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram 1240. [1]</p>

<p>‘Letter of instructions’ has been continuously discussed and somewhat amended but I believe not in any really important sense from what I have sent you. It will be considered by President [2] and Churchill tomorrow after which presumably it will be telegraphed to you in full.</p>

<p>The question of ‘appropriate body’ which is to give instructions to supreme commander is still undecided. Difficulties are-(a) that at such a body would have to make decisions not only in respect of South-West Pacific but wherever the war is being conducted against the Axis, and (b) that members of such a body would have to refer any matter of consequence back to their Governments. Opinion at moment is tending towards a joint staff body in London and a similar body in Washington, which would receive supreme commander’s recommendations and after quick consideration consult with Governments concerned.</p>
