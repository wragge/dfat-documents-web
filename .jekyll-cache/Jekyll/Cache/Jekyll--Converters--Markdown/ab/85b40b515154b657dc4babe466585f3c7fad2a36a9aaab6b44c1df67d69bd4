I"?<p>Windsor Castle, 24 April 1973</p>

<p>Confidential</p>

<p>At our meeting on Saturday, 21 April, we exchanged notes on our joint understanding of what had been agreed between The Queen and the Prime Minister the previous evening and I promised to set this down on paper. Here it is.</p>

<p><em>(a) The Queens Style and Title</em></p>

<p>It was agreed that Mr Whitlam should introduce legislation to amend The Queen’s present Style and Title so that it should read:</p>

<p>‘Elizabeth The Second by the Grace of God of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth.’</p>

<p>I said in response to your enquiry that there would be no objection to the Prime Minister announcing his intention to introduce such legislation as soon as he wished. I should add that I know it would give The Queen pleasure to approve this legislation personally when she is in Canberra in October and to sign the necessary Proclamation.</p>

<p><em>(b) Agreement and Letters of Credence</em></p>

<p>It was agreed that The Queen should continue to sign letters of Credence for Australian Ambassadors to Foreign countries and Australian High Commissioners to Republican Commonwealth countries, and similarly letters of Credence for Foreign Ambassadors and High Commissioners from Republican Commonwealth countries accredited to Australia should continue to be addressed to Her Majesty.</p>

<p>It was noted that when The Queen’s Style and Title has been changed, this essentially Australian title will in future appear at the head of the letters as opposed to the existing one which makes mention of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Queen is ready to agree that informal and formal approvals in connection with diplomatic appointments and Agrèments should in future be given by the Governor-General on her behalf. Her Majesty would wish to be informed of such appointments and Agrèments after formal approval had been given.</p>

<p>You said you would consider whether it was necessary for The Queen to sign or approve any instrument giving effect to the above. It may be that the present system is just a question of usage and that the Governor-General already has the necessary powers, and that nothing formal will therefore be necessary.</p>

<p><em>(c) Coinage</em></p>

<p>As ‘the Second’ is to be retained in The Queen’s Style and Title, I understand that the question of changing the coinage does not arise.</p>

<p><em>(d) State Visits abroad by the Governor-General</em></p>

<p>I do not believe that this was mentioned between The Queen and the Prime Minister but I can confirm that in so far as Her Majesty is concerned there are no objections of any kind to the Governor-General paying State Visits abroad.</p>

<p><em>(e) Nomenclature of Commonwealth Heads of Mission: Ambassador or High Commissioner</em></p>

<p>I do not believe that this question was discussed either. I do know, however, that Her Majesty favours the retention of ‘High Commissioner’ as it emphasizes the Commonwealth link.</p>

<p>If, however, there was a general wish amongst all Commonwealth countries to change to ‘Ambassador’ this is something which I am sure Her Majesty would accept.</p>

<p>I think this covers all the points which were raised—or on the agenda, and I hope I have given an accurate account of what was agreed.</p>
