<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>Concern referred to in your telegram 239<a href="#f1">1</a> exists among some officials in Ministry of External Affairs but I have found no evidence of it at government level.</p>

<p>2. Tunku told me last night that he was not worried about Australiaâ€™s attitude on defence. No further assurances about our intentions or obligations were required and the less said the better. He knew Australia and Australians and was confident of our friendship and support in emergency.</p>
