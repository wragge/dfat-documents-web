<p>Your instructions [1] in close harmony with United Kingdom Government’s policy.</p>

<p>Sanctions issue unlikely to arise. Reference to expulsion under Article 16 paragraph (4) power rests with the Council. Certain South American countries anxious for expulsion; the United Kingdom Government and France will not oppose this. Oslo Powers and Turkey hesitant.</p>

<p>The Assembly’s resolution will probably express condemnation and recommend assistance to Finland on individual basis, leaving the question of expulsion to the Council with or without expression of the Assembly’s opinion.</p>

<p>Vote may be taken 13th December or 14th December. In view of the probable urgency, I propose to act in conformity with the United Kingdom delegation unless further instructions received. Elections to Permanent Court of International justice postponed.</p>
