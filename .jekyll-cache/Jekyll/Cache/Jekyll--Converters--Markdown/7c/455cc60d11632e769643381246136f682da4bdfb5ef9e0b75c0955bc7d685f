<p>Received 3 January 1946</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>1. Thanks your telegrams which are much appreciated. I am assuming that you have done nothing definitive to accept the veto principle for the Far Eastern Commission embodied in paragraph 5(2). [1] Such a veto is quite indefensible. Both United Kingdom and United States have vacillated over this matter solely to appease the Soviet. The Korean position also shows failure to safeguard our position. [2]</p>

<p>2.Peace Conference proposal at MOSCOW [3] is final recognition of the success of the main object of my London mission.</p>

<p>3. Regarding United Kingdom Conference, development over security [4] is probably the result of my absence from London. In these circumstances I prefer to finalize my recommendation of actual delegates next Monday after consultations.</p>

<p>4. Please make it clear that Watt is not to circulate noteâ€™ from London. I have already pointed out that diplomatic channels alone should be used. This procedure and timing can also be finalized on Monday.</p>

<p>5. We must make every effort to ensure that representation is the best available in the circumstances.</p>

<p>6. I would like Burton as well as yourself to be in Sydney on Monday. it will be a great help to be in personal touch with the Prime Minister on Monday.</p>

<p>7. Please see that arrangements have been made for landing facilities for out party whether arrival Sunday night or Monday.</p>
