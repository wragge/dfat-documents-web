I";	<p>Letter MELBOURNE, 22 January 1941</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>I am in receipt of your letter of 18th January [1] in regard to the despatch of a Military Mission from Australia to the Netherlands East Indies for secret staff conferences. [2]</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Government are in agreement with the proposals made in your letter and will despatch a Delegation consisting of a Naval officer, an Air Force officer and a technical officer from the Ministry of Munitions to the Netherlands East Indies for secret conversations at an early date, on the understanding that they do not imply any political commitments on either side.</p>

<p>It is proposed that the Delegation should leave Australia in 10 to 12 days’ time. I shall arrange for further advice to be sent to you as to the names of the officers and the proposed date of departure as soon as possible. [3]</p>

<p>My Government also agree to the proposed visit of the Chief of the Indies General Staff to Australia at a later date. [4]</p>
