<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>I received your letter enclosing communications from Shaw. I am endeavouring to see Eisenhower and Marshall about their subject matter. My first reaction, and it is a strong one, is that these stories are typical of military and diplomatic gossip that is so easily picked up in the hot-bed of Tokyo. It would be most unfortunate if our relationships with the United States became strained on the basis of such reports. I would strongly suggest that while I will endeavour to find out what is possible in Washington, you might write a personal letter to MacArthur. I am certain that in his dealings with you or me he would be perfectly frank.</p>
