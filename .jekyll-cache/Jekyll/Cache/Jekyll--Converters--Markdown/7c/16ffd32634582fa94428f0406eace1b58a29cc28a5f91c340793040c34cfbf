<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My immediately following telegram contains instructions sent to New York on the Balkans situation. [1] Please raise the matter with the Soviet Government on the highest level stressing our anxiety that a failure to reach a basis of agreement will mean a disastrous loss of confidence in the United Nations.</p>

<p>2. Both sides have agreed that the situation constitutes a threat to peace.</p>

<p>3. The Security Council is therefore obliged to act although agreement cannot be reached on fixing responsibility. We feel that our proposal will form a satisfactory basis of action while not infringing upon the opinions of either the U.S.S.R. or the United States.</p>

<p>4. You should impress the point that the decision lies between disillusionment which may be a first step towards the collapse of the U.N. and acceptance of a compromise by both sides.</p>

<p>5. Please advise urgently Soviet reaction.</p>
