<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 12. [2]</p>

<p>We have the same view of Casey [3] as yourself. Our whole purpose is that in view of Evattâ€™s [4] almost due arrival Washington we greatly hope Casey will be there as that conjunction invaluable.</p>

<p>That is full extent our demurrer. Casey has never intimated to me any desire for change but we would not stand in way your desire.</p>

<p>We should hope however Casey stays long enough to meet Evatt and thus accomplish our desires. [5]</p>
