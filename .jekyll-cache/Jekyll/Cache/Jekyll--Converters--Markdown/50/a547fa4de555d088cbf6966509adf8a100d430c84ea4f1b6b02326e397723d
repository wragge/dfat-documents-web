I"Í<p>Cablegram unnumbered 25 August 1939,</p>

<p>Reference your suggestion that I again cable Chamberlain [1], I feel that our position made clear by my cable to him on August 18th. [2] Moreover, his letter to Hitler seems to express position adequately. [3]</p>

<p>You may inform United Kingdom Government, however, that while our attitude of co-operation is as stated by me publicly on Wednesday [4] we would desire warmly to encourage a peaceful and just settlement to which Poland made genuine contribution.</p>

<p>We have taken preliminary steps under our War Book but public opinion steady and good.</p>
