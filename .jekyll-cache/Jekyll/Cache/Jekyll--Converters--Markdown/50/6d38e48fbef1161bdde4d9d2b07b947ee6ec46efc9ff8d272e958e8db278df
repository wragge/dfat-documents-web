I"A	<p>Cablegram 543 WASHINGTON, 21 July 1941, 7.50 p.m.</p>

<p>I saw Sumner Welles [1] today.</p>

<p>They have information that 11 Japanese troopships left Chinese</p>

<p>ports today and that a convoy of Japanese troopships (strength</p>

<p>unspecified) has also left Formosa for unknown destination.</p>

<p>Sumner Welles said that their information was that the Japanese</p>

<p>would attack Indo-China bases on July 24th. [2] French may or may</p>

<p>not put up token of resistance.</p>

<p>As soon as the fact of Japanese occupation of additional areas in</p>

<p>Indo-China can be definitely established (which Sumner Welles</p>

<p>thought would not take longer than two days after such occupation)</p>

<p>United States would take the following economic action:-</p>

<p>(a) Freezing of all Japanese funds in United States.</p>

<p>(b) Stoppage of practically all imports from Japan including silk.</p>

<p>(c) Limitation of export of all petroleum products from United</p>

<p>States to Japan to the level of some past year such as 1934.</p>

<p>(d) Further reduction in octane rating petrol exportable to Japan.</p>

<p>[3]</p>

<p>Sumner Welles said he had no clear idea what economic action</p>

<p>Britain and Australia propose to take but he hoped that the lack</p>

<p>of economic action by us would not offset the abovementioned</p>

<p>United States action.</p>

<p>I asked Sumner Welles if he did not think some further warning to</p>

<p>Japan was worth while. He said that except for precise knowledge</p>

<p>of details Japanese already knew some such strong industrial</p>

<p>action as the above would follow on any further aggression.</p>

<p>On my inquiring what response he anticipated that Japan would make</p>

<p>to the above American action he said that he expected renewed</p>

<p>public outburst regarding British-American policy of</p>

<p>‘encirclement’ and strong protests but nothing more.</p>

<p>1 U.S. Acting Secretary of State.</p>

<p>2 Casey’s cablegram 548 of 22 July (on file AA : A981, Indo-China</p>

<p>7, i) indicated that this probably meant ‘23rd July Australian</p>

<p>time’.</p>

<p>3 Casey cabled further details of proposed U.S. economic sanctions</p>

<p>on 22 July. See cablegram 550 on file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i.</p>
