<p>PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 163 of the 27th July [1]-you can rely on me to press on Attlee and Bevin Australian right to be consulted and have our views considered before major decisions reached.</p>

<p>I have considerable hopes that many of the difficulties we have experienced in the past will disappear under the new Government which will conduct public affairs more in accordance with the accepted principles of individual ministerial responsibility than was the case under the late regime.</p>
