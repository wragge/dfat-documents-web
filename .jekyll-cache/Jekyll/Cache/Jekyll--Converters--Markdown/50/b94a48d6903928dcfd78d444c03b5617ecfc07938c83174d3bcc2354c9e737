<p>Personal</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Downer has asked me to send you a copy of this letter, approved by him, which I have written today to the Home Secretary. <a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>May I say in addition to you that I spent my last week-end in Australia with my Godfather and your friend, Lord Casey. <a href="#f2">2</a> He said to me in dismay that he saw in this legislation the destruction of all that he has worked for over the last sixty years and he wondered if, when he arrives in June, as a Knight of the Garter he will be asked if he has a work permit.</p>

<p>1  Document 343.</p>

<p>2 Richard G. Casey, former Australian Foreign Minister and Governor-General; Life Peer in the House of Lords.</p>
