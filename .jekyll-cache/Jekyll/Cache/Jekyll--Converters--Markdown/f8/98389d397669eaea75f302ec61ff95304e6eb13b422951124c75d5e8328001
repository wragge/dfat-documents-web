I"-<p>Cablegram unnumbered WELLINGTON, 31 March 1939, 12.33 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram of 29th March. [1] I largely agree with your views concerning the necessity for a general reservation that many, if not all, of the subjects to be discussed at the forthcoming Conference must finally depend on the approval of the respective Governments. It has always been our desire, however, to carry the discussions on all the subjects on the Agenda, whether purely military or partly political, as far as possible. I should have thought it helpful in this connection had it been possible for Australia to be represented by a Minister. Similarly, I should have thought it an advantage if the Australian Delegation could have included a member competent to discuss paragraph (h) and even at this stage, whilst fully appreciating difficulty, I should be inclined to suggest that you again consider the possibility of including such an officer, and also, if that is practicable, a Ministerial representative. I fully appreciate the importance of the views expressed in your letter of 14th March concerning civil air routes [2], but I am convinced of the necessity for discussing this matter at the Conference and I sincerely trust that Australia may yet find it possible to take part in this discussion. Should there be any alteration in the Australian Delegation as already intimated to us, I should be glad of early advice.</p>

<p>2 Not printed (on file AA: A981, Pacific 1). It conveyed the Australian Governmentâ€™s view that the Trans-Pacific Air Service was a matter of such vital and urgent importance that it could only be dealt with by the Ministers responsible and should be discussed in London at the earliest possible date.</p>
