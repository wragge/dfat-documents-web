<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Publication here of complaints by members of Parliament and others is doing our reputation harm. Your own reported statements and those of Spender [1] are excellent and breathe a spirit of courage and defiance which is regarded as in true Australian tradition.</p>

<p>Our losses are very small compared with those of say Scotland. It would be a pity for a few politicians to impair our high reputation in this country. Churchill has this afternoon refused a war debate, and the public morale is good.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>MENZIES</p>

<p>1 Minister for the Army.</p>
