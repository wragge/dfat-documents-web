<p><strong>The Royal Style and Titles</strong></p>

<p>1. The Prime Minister has indicated that he wishes The Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 amended to delete references to the words ‘by the Grace of God’, ‘of the United Kingdom’, and ‘Defender of the Faith’.</p>

<p>2. The Queen’s Royal Style and Titles for Australia is recounted in the Schedule to the Royal Style and Titles Act (no. 32 of 1953) attached.<a href="#f1">1</a> The position is similar in Canada and New Zealand.</p>

<p>3. A number of Commonwealth countries have adopted Royal Style and Titles omitting reference to ‘by the Grace of God’ and ‘of the United Kingdom’. They have also omitted the words ‘Defender of the Faith’. These countries are:– Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Nigeria.</p>

<p>4. The forms adopted by Jamaica, Trinidad, Uganda and Fiji include the words ‘by the Grace of God’.</p>

<p>5. However, these countries have retained as a common element with other Commonwealth Titles the description of the Sovereign as Queen of her other Realms and Territories and Head of the Commonwealth. There was consultation between these countries and the Australian Government when they proposed making the changes.</p>

<p>6. Omission of the three phrases will affect a number of Instruments wherein the Royal Style and Titles are used in relation to Australia and its Territories, i.e. the Seal, Royal Warrants, Commissions of Appointment, etc.</p>

<p>7. There may be some controversy over the exclusion of ‘by the Grace of God’. The phrase has been continuously associated with the title of ‘Queen’ (or ‘King’) since the: reign of William Rufus,<a href="#f2">2</a> the Coronation being recognised as a Christian ceremony.</p>

<p>8. All the Christian Realms except South Africa add ‘Defender of the Faith’. Some people will no doubt take strong exception to the omission of the words. However, there is no established Church in Australia.</p>

<p>9. It is strictly a matter for Her Majesty’s Ministers in the country concerned to decide whether a change in the Royal Style and Titles is relevant to their circumstances. In the case of Australia it would be expected that we should seek Her Majesty’s informal approval before proceeding with legislation to omit the references. Formal approval could be sought after the views of other Commonwealth Governments had been obtained. These countries might then be advised formally when the new Title was brought into use.</p>
