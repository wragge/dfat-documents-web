<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Our E.20. [2] Following from Shaw.</p>

<p>You may care to convey to Dr. Evatt that in my opinion the question is urgent and of some considerable importance in the long term development of Japan. Your suggestion about enquiry for information in the Allied Council would in my view be too weak and also profitless as I have already conveyed to you far more background on this subject than the Allied Council chairman would ever divulge in public. I trust that agreement to the agenda item can be reached by Friday August 27th in time for fun ventilation at the next meeting on September 1st.</p>

<p>_1 J.A. Walshe, Private secretary to Dr Evatt.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 17 August 1948; it conveyed the message sent by Shaw in Document 333, paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>
