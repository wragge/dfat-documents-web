<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Koets, the Political Adviser to Beel and â€˜Chef de Cabinetâ€™ of the Government of Indonesia arranged an informal talk with Leimena. In the course of discussions, Koets expressed the following views:-</p>

<p>(a) As Leimena had predicted to Koets some months ago, the military action had brought chaos to Indonesia;</p>

<p>(b) The return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta was out of the question because the Dutch feared the propaganda of Soekarno and Hatta;</p>

<p>(c) The Netherlands Government can, therefore, only accept some points of the Security Councilâ€™s resolution [1];</p>

<p>(d) Inspired by the B.F.O., a new question was arising as to whether the transfer of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia should not take place within a very short time.</p>

<p>2. Queried by Leimena on the new suggestion for an early transfer of sovereignty, Koets indicated that:</p>

<p>(a) Sovereignty might be transferred by May or June, (b) There was no detailed programme in mind, (c) Details for the interim period could be discussed with the B.F.O.</p>

<p>3. This report of the discussions confirms that the Netherlands:</p>

<p>(1) Will not release the Republican leaders unconditionally, (2) Will endeavour to bypass the Security Councilâ€™s resolution with generalisations designed to create the impression that a liberal policy is being followed with the full approval of â€˜most Indonesiansâ€™ (i.e. the Federalists), (3) Will endeavour on this basis to delay further consideration of the resolution, (4) Has no concrete proposals for the immediate future.</p>

<p>4. The present difficulties confirm that the basic Netherlands objections to the Republic has always been that it is a political organisation which they did not create and cannot control. Their policy has been to destroy it and create a new political structure of their own.</p>
