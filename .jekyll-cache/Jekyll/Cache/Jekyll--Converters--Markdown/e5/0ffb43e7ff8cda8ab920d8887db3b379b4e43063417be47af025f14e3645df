<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Reparations.</p>

<p>I have now received through the United Kingdom Government the formal communication set out below with a request that I will immediately transmit it to you. Begins:</p>

<p>â€˜The Provisional Government of France and the Governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland and the United States of America, being the three powers with zones of occupation in Western Germany, invite the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to supply by October 1st 1945 data relating to the reparations claim of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia against Germany and the value of prewar German assets situated in its territory.â€™ Ends.</p>

<p>This invitation is based on paragraph 3 of the protocol on German reparations resulting from the Potsdam Conference. The document I have received has two annexes [1] in which suggestions are made as to the nature of the data to be supplied and the form in which they are to be presented. I am forwarding the memo and annexes by Lancastrian service.</p>
