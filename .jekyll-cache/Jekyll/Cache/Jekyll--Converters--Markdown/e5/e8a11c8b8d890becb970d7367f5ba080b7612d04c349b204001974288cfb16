<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Suggestion has been made of meeting of South East Asia countries to discuss Indonesian situation. We have not yet been invited but may be. Prime Ministerâ€™s view is that logical and reasonable thing is for us to attend but would have to weigh political considerations. These may be less serious if Australia was well represented and succeeded in persuading group to act as regional group and express view or recommendations in first instance to Security Council or Assembly that is acting in accord with Chapter eight. [1] Prime Minister would appreciate your views so that if approach is made we can respond one way or other without delay.</p>

<p>1 Chapter Eight of the United Nations Charter (Articles 52-54) is concerned with regional arrangements.</p>
