<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Our immediately preceding telegram to you [1] has arrived from Critchley since we spoke to you this morning. It confirms that American pressure is responsible for instructions received by Republic representatives in New York, and reinforces our conviction that trade and other controversial matters should be fully aire in Security Council, even though there may be no particular advantage in lengthy discussions if this can be avoided.</p>

<p>2. You will also note that Dutch have apparently not agreed to admit Republican representatives to interim Government at this stage. You should make a point of Critchleyâ€™s penultimate sentence in Security Council debate.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Dispatched on 17 February, it conveyed the text of Document 73.</p>
