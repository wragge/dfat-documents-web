<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No.165 to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.â€™ Intention of United Kingdom Government was that reply, draft sent in Circular D.682, should be forwarded to the French, and followed by oral and private discussions referred to in D.67 [3], and that no public statement should be made until such discussions had taken place and agreement arrived at.</p>

<p>Am not clear whether points raised in your telegram 165 were intended as suggestions for alterations to the draft reply to the French which is described in D.67 as â€˜of an interim nature onlyâ€™ or whether they constitute a further contribution to the general discussion of war aims initiated by your telegram of 28th October.</p>

<p>At meeting today between Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Dominion Ministersâ€™ view taken was to send reply to French practically in terms of draft sent in D.68, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs indicating that it was proposed to follow the reply by personal discussions and that in no case would any public statement be made until after discussion with the Dominions.</p>
