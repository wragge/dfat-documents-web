<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>1. Batavia advises that Dutch are arguing that resolution on Consular Commission cancelled instructions to Committee of Good Offices. [1]</p>

<p>2. Divergent views exist in Consular Commission as to respective functions of the Committee and the Commission and their jurisdiction over military observers. Commission will probably cable Security Council asking for clarification. It has cabled Security Council stating assumption that Council intended Australia and Belgium to be members. Our interpretation of Colombian Resolution [2] is that Australia is included in membership. Critchley considers it desirable that Australia should be represented and we concur with his view that it might enable us to prevent white washing of Dutch actions.</p>

<p>3. In any case, however, it might be desirable to explore possibility of recision of Colombian Resolution in view of conflict over the functions of the two bodies. If recision could be achieved Committee of Good Offices could undertake all tasks conferred on Commission. We would not object to enlargement of Committee for this purpose.</p>

<p>4. Pass to Washington.</p>
