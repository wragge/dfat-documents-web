<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>1. Council today continued general discussion. [1] Dutch made statement trying to show conditions were mostly back to normal in occupied areas and offering programme for future constitutional change which would set election third quarter of this year and transfer of sovereignty ‘as early as possible in 1950’.</p>

<p>2. Cuba urged adoption of main points in United States draft [2] but stipulated immediate withdrawal of Dutch forces. Burma spoke on similar lines. We made statement in line with your 22 [3] including description of conditions in your 23 [4] in refutation of Dutch assertion. We also quoted report [5] received today from group military observers in Soerabaya area in the same sense.</p>

<p>3. Council meeting again on Monday. United States delegation is anxious to receive our views on their text before meeting. They are still undecided whether to submit resolution. On the one hand they do not want another abortive resolution on the other hand they do not want to be party to some compromise which will put Republic in worse position than it is now.</p>
