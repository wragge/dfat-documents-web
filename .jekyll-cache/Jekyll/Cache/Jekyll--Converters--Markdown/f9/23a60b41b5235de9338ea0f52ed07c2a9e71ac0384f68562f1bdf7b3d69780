<p>103. CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p><strong>Consultative Committee of Japan and Colombo Plan</strong></p>

<p>1. United Kingdom delegation reports that Morrow,<a href="#f1">1</a> head of programme planning division E.S.S. (S.C.A.P.) approached their embassy with the suggestion that an invitation might be issued to the Supreme Commander to send an observer (probably Morrow himself) to the Committee. It appears that the Americans in Tokyo are keen on Japanese representation and suggest Japan might use its sterling fund balance to provide capital, equipment and material on loan.</p>

<p>2. United Kingdom Embassy has reported back that United States Embassy has no brief on Japanese participation and Australiaâ€™s view that it should not be raised formally. The United Kingdom has therefore informed the Americans that any proposal should be made by them and, if it is to be raised that an informal approach should first be made to Australian and New Zealand delegations.</p>

<p>3. S.C.A.P. proposal is a surprise to the American delegation, which has cabled for instructions. The delegation has no wish to press the proposal and has recommended that it should not be made at this meeting. My impression is that United States delegation is favourably disposed towards eventual Japanese participation, but believe that it would be inappropriate now and should not be rushed.</p>
