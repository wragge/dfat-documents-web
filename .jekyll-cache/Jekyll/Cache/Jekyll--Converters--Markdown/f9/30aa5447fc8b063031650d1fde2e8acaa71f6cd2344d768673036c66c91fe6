<p>PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>We are in grave difficulties in House regarding soldiers pay on which Labour has challenged us and there is much Country Party and Corner support for the challenge. I have indicated that we will not give way, and unless something happens we will be defeated next week. Only way out may be to take several Country Party members into Cabinet. Would be glad to know definitely if I can consider this on assumption that after your return here you will take up Washington appointment. Reply urgent. Regards.</p>
