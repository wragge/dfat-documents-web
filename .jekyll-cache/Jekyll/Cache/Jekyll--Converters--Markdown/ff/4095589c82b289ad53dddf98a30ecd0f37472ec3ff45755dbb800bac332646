I"ð<p>Cablegram 538 CANBERRA, 31 August 1947, 10.30 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Please convey the following message to MacArthur from Minister:-</p>

<p>Begins:</p>

<p>The Canberra Conference has shown not only a remarkable degree of common ground but also almost complete agreement with what was your general approach and also my own.</p>

<p>I shall send you a fuller report. In the meantime, press reports are by no means full or reliable.</p>

<p>Marshall has sent me a message saying that he hopes that it will be possible to hold preliminary discussions during the first few weeks of the General Assembly. I am replying that I think this will be suitable so long as matter is then pressed forward with energy and despatch.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Ends. [1]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 MacArthur replied on 3 September: â€˜Thanks for your message and heartiest congratulations on the success of the Canberra Conference. It reflects your leadership.â€™</p>

<p>_</p>
