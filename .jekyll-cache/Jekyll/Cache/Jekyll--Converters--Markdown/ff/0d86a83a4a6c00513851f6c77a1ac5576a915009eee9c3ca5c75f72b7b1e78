<p>Security 536.</p>

<p>1. Council [met] today with Agenda as in our UN.1197. [1]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>4. First report of Committee of Three on Indonesia (S/611) [2] was noted, after U.S.S.R. had stressed need for greater speed in Committee’s work and more frequent reports to Council.</p>

<p>5. We drew Council’s attention to the question of Committee’s membership after December 31st. United States spoke against any change in membership and there appears general support for this view. U.S.S.R. and Poland asked that no decision be taken today but indicated they would have no objection to Australia remaining on Committee. Hood summed up the discussion as indicating that, subject to confirmation at next meeting, Council had reached an understanding that membership should remain the same. This was agreed to. Probably Gromyko was merely without instructions [and] we hope to clear matter with him before next meeting.</p>
