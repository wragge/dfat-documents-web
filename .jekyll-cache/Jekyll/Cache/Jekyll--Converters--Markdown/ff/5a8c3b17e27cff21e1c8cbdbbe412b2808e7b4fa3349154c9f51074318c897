<p>Further meeting of the Advisory Committee held this evening.</p>

<p>Representative of Ecuador proposed immediate declaration of Japan as aggressor but did not persist in the face of the proposal by France supported by the United Kingdom that Sub-committee be appointed to deal with Chinaâ€™s appeal. Meeting adjourned until tomorrow when the Sub-committee will probably be appointed and the terms of reference to the Sub-committee approved. Present indications are that Australia will be invited to join the Sub- committee and unavoidably accept.</p>
