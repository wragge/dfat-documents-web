I"è<p>Circular Cablegram D113 LONDON, 4 December 1939, 9.50 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Interim reply to French Government on War Aims. We feel that the amendment to paragraph 7 suggested in New Zealand telegram 224 of 28th November is an improvement and we propose to adopt it. [1] It seems to us however that the amendment to paragraph 4 would affect the sense and that the word â€˜voluntarilyâ€™ sufficiently implies the idea of negotiation. We think it preferable therefore to retain the original wording.</p>

<p>In the absence of further comments we propose to despatch the reply as amended to the French Government on Friday next, 8th December.</p>
