<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia.</p>

<p>1. United Kingdom attitude at Security Council was disappointing.</p>

<p>Their abstention at Lapstone against India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand must have encouraged Dutch and there does not seem to be full appreciation of our quite vital interests in this area.</p>

<p>It will be serious if on Monday, Indonesian matter is not pressed very hard if cease-fire is not implemented. We cannot understand United Kingdom refusal to support part of United States resolution calling for withdrawal of troops. Cease-fire order is now directed at Republicans.</p>

<p>2. Press reports move to hold urgent British Commonwealth conference on South East Asia affairs. Is there any truth in this?</p>
