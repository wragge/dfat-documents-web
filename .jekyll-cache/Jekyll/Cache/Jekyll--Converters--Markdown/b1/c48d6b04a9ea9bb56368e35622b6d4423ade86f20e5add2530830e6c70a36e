<p>O.JA3669 SECRET IMMEDIATE</p>

<h2 id="portuguese-timor">Portuguese Timor</h2>

<p>Australiaâ€™s positive vote on the Portuguese Timor resolution in Fourth Committee was described to us today by Tjan as â€˜disastrousâ€™. He said Indonesia had hoped that Australia would have been helpful in the United Nations. Australiaâ€™s vote and approach in the United Nations was in direct contrast to that of other regional countries such as Japan, PNG, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and India.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Following receipt of Saniâ€™s telegram reporting developments in the United Nations on 10 December Tjan said questions were asked here about Australiaâ€™s intentions. General Moerdani had referred to Australiaâ€™s â€˜double-crossâ€™ and certain BAKIN Generals had spoken in similar terms (this was before the vote was taken in the Fourth Committee).</li>
  <li>Tjan said that the United Nations vote would be very important in determining Indonesiaâ€™s attitude towards Australia. Until the vote, there had been â€˜general understandingâ€™ of the antiÂ­ Indonesia activities in Australia-union bans, critical press comment and so on. Indonesia he said had gone out of its way â€˜to make allowances for certain thingsâ€™. But now he doubted whether this understanding would prevail.</li>
  <li>We defended at length our position again to Tjan. He was not receptive.</li>
  <li>This is of course a first reaction and we shall also need to take soundings elsewhere in the Indonesian Government (although as you know Tjan is a central figure in the powerful â€˜Palace Groupâ€™). We shall report further as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Tjan has just rung to say he has spoken to General Ali Murtopo about Australiaâ€™s vote. He said that Ali was extremely disappointed. Ali commented that Indonesia would have to consider what â€˜positive actionâ€™ to take concerning Australia.</li>
