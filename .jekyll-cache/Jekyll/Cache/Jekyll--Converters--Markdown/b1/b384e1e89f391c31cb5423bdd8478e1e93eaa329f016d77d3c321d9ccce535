<p>CER-Phasing Out of Export Incentives</p>

<p>Further to my earlier minute<a href="#f1">1</a> on this matter Al Pageâ€™s report on his discussions with Ted Woodfield is attached.</p>

<p>The issue having been uncorked I believe it important that it be mentioned in you next contact with Harry Clark (10 a.m. Tuesday 17/8)<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>it is potentially more destructive than forest products.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might wish to approach it along the following lines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recent indications are that New Zealand is not acknowledging a commitment to phase out incentives from 1985</li>
  <li>appreciate the value of not blocking off the option of complete removal before 1987</li>
  <li>but Minister has told Cabinet and Australian industry that the New Zealand Prime Minister agreed to phasing out from 1985</li>
  <li>we cannot retract from this</li>
  <li>can play it low key along lines:
    <ul>
      <li>details of removal to be worked out after New Zealand review announced in Budget</li>
      <li>make reference to international pressures on New Zealand to remove incentives</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>but need assurance that phasing from 1985 is the backmarker</li>
  <li>how do we go about getting assurance?
    <ul>
      <li>should the Minister write to Mr Muldoon?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
