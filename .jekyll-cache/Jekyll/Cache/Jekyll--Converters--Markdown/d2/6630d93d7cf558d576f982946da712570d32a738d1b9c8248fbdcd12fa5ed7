I"Ó<p>Cablegram 268 WASHINGTON, 19 September 1940</p>

<p>SECRET FOR MINISTER AND PRIME MINISTER ONLY</p>

<p>I am told under conditions of absolute secrecy by good authority that it is possible that Willkie [1] will announce in near future that he is in favour of some form of mutual defensive arrangement with Australia.</p>

<p>I believe present Administration is moving in this general direction and probably Republican candidate is trying to get in first. It will be particularly useful if Willkie does make such a declaration as my hope is that it would remove the matter from the controversial political field. My fear has lately been that Willkie would charge the President [2] publicly with working underground towards some such long distance obligation in the Pacific unconnected with Hemisphere defence and that President would have to deny any such intention.</p>

<p>There is of course obvious other danger that President will think himself obliged to take opposite line of policy to any declaration by Willkie but I have less fear of this.</p>

<p>If and when Willkie does make abovementioned declaration I strongly suggest that no Government or Ministerial comment be made in Australia although please do not inform other Ministers in advance of possibility of such a statement. Grateful if utmost secrecy maintained.</p>
