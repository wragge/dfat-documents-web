I"³<p>Memorandum S3878 LONDON, 22 May 1937</p>

<p>In continuation of S.3865 [1], during a farewell conversation on 19th May between Sir R. Clive [2], the Minister for Foreign Affairs [3] and the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs [4], the Japanese Ministers referred to Mr Lyonsâ€™s suggestion of a non- aggression pact. Sir R. Clive reported his conversation with Count Makino [5] and complete agreement was expressed on the following points:-</p>

<p>(1) An understanding in the Pacific, especially between Great Britain, the United States of America and Japan, should be the objective to be worked for.</p>

<p>(2) A conference at present would be premature. Much detailed preparation would be necessary before any such understanding could be usefully discussed.</p>

<p>(3) An improvement in Japanâ€™s relations with China was the first essential. This, the Ambassador said, would be welcomed in England and, he believed, in the United States of America. The way would then be clearer for a general understanding regarding the Pacific.</p>
