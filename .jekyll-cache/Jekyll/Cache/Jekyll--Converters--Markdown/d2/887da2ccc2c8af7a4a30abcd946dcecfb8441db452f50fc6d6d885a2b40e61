<p>On 21st January â€˜Antaraâ€™<a href="#f1">1</a> reported Dr. Subandrio as having said on 20th January in Djogjakarta<a href="#f2">2</a> that Indonesia cannot but adopt a policy of confrontation against Malaya because at present they represent themselves as accomplices of Neo-Colonialists and Neo-Imperialists pursuing a hostile policy towards Indonesia. It was regrettable, Subandrio reportedly said, that we have to adopt such a policy towards our neighbour Malaya whom we always regarded as friend and brother, but our patience towards Malaya has its limits.</p>

<p>â€˜Antaraâ€™ reported that Dr. Subandrio, whose speech was warmly supported by the enthusiastic students as he vehemently attacked the Imperialists, Colonialists, and their Lackeys, said that Indonesia had always adopted a policy of confrontation against Imperialism and Colonialism in all its forms.</p>

<p>It is now with great regret that we have to apply it to Malaya. This did not mean Indonesia was entering war with Malaya for confrontation could be carried out without a war.</p>
