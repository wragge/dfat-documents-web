<p>PRIVATE FOR DR EVATT CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Reply to your 222. [1]</p>

<p>There being a deep feeling of kinship between our two democratic peoples there is here the most sympathetic understanding of your viewpoint because of the realisation of immediate common interests. Do not for a second doubt it and be assured that action here is based on full knowledge, independent judgment, the most vigilant watchfulness of current affairs and unstinted efforts to bring full weight to bear in the common enterprise.</p>

<p>On the basis of our candid friendship I should like to add a word about Casey [2] since I believe you do not know him personally. I do so wholly on my own and without his suggestion or knowledge.</p>

<p>He enjoys the complete confidence of all in authority here from the highest down for his zeal on behalf of his country, for his persuasiveness and discretion. I myself have had the best of opportunity for testing his qualities and I can assure you that he deserves your complete confidence.</p>
