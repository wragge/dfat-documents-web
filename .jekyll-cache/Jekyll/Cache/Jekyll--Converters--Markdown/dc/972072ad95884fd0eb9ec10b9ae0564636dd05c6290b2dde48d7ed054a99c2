I"Ò<p>Letter CANBERRA, 1 July 1947</p>

<p>I think the time has arrived when it might be helpful for me to establish an Advisory Committee on the proposed Japanese Settlement.</p>

<p>As I suggested in the House, the Advisory Committee would best be a mixed one, i.e. including Members of Parliament and other persons with special knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>Because of his training and experience, I am proposing to ask Sir Frederic Eggleston to chair the Committee. He has already been chairing a Departmental Committee which has worked for some time on this subject and which has already prepared one draft, submitted to Cabinet in Agendum No. 1341.</p>

<p>I propose to invite the following persons to join the Committee:-</p>

<p>Parliamentary Members:</p>

<p>Mr. K. E. Beazley, M.P.</p>

<p>Mr. T. Sheehan, M.P.</p>

<p>The Hon. A. McK. McDonald, M.P.</p>

<p>Mr. B.H. Corset, M.P.</p>

<p>Senator Dorothy M. Tangney Senator W. J. Cooper, M.B.E. [1]</p>

<p>Others:</p>

<p>The Hon. Sir Frederic Eggleston (Chairman) Professor K. H. Bailey (Vice-Chairman) Brigadier A. S. Blackburn, V.C., LL.B. (S.A.) The Hon. P. J. Clarey, M.L.C. (Vic.) Miss Constance Duncan, M.A. (Vic.) Mr. P. R. Wilkins (A.C.T.) Lieut.-General Sir Leslie Morshead, K.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., E.D.</p>

<p>(N.S.W.) Professor A. H. McDonald (N.S.W.) Mr. R. J. F. Boyer, M.A. (N.S.W.) Professor A. L. Sadler, M.A. (N.S.W.) Sir Douglas Mawson, O.B.E., F.R.S., D.Sc., B.E. (S.A.) [2]</p>

<p>If you approve, I would propose to invite the Members of Parliament concerned and to inform the respective Leaders of the United Australia Party and the Country Party.</p>

<p>Any further suggestions from yourself would be appreciated. [3]</p>

<p>H.V. EVATT</p>
