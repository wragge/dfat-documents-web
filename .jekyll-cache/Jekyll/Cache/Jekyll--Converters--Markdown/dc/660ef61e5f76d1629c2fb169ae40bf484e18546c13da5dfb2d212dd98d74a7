<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your airmail report of 9th July.</p>

<p>Your suggestion for an appropriately worded high level appeal from United Kingdom instead of an agreement containing assurances by Australia is a happy one. It has many psychological advantages.</p>

<p>The precise content of the letter of appeal, particularly the suggestion for Australian action, would of course be crucial both from the psychological and technical viewpoints and I assume that the appeal would NOT be made without my having approved beforehand the actual terms of the letter. This is vital.</p>
