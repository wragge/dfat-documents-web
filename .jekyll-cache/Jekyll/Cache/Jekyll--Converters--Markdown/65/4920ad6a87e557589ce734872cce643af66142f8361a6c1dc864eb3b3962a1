<p>Top Secret</p>

<p><strong>Without Memorandum—Indonesian Paratroop Landing in Malaysia (Johore)</strong></p>

<p>The Minister for External Affairs outlined for the information of Cabinet the known facts of the Indonesian paratroop landing in Johore. He informed the Cabinet that the Malaysian Government had decided to take the matter of the Indonesian landing to the Security Council without delay, and that it was likely that the Security Council would hold a special meeting on Tuesday, 8th September.</p>

<p>2. The Minister also informed the Cabinet that the Malaysian Government had asked each of its Commonwealth allies for an assurance of support in armed defensive measures against Indonesia in the event of further aggression,<a href="#f1">1</a> and that the British Government had now responded with an assurance. The terms of the assurance were given to the Cabinet by the Minister, the Cabinet noting:—</p>

<p>(a) that it related to further aggression upon the territory of Malaya or Singapore and not to confrontation operations in Borneo;</p>

<p>(b) that it encompassed a counter-attack against some appropriate objective ‘on Indonesian territory’.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>3. The Cabinet indicated that the question of an assurance to Malaysia and its terms should only be considered in the light of the action which Australia would be prepared to take if further aggression occurred requiring response by Malaysia and its allies. It agreed that in such a circumstance Australia would stand by its obligation to Malaysia and be willing therefore to take part in appropriate military action to prevent repetition of the aggression.</p>

<p>4. It was therefore agreed by Cabinet that the Australian Government should communicate an assurance to Malaysia on approximately the same lines as the British assurance, though not necessarily with specific reference to counter-attacks on Indonesian territory.</p>

<p>5. The question of the publication of the assurance was discussed. It was felt that Australia’s course in this matter should be governed largely by what the British Government intends about its own assurance. If that assurance were to be published, the Australian assurance should also be published—if not, then it would probably be undesirable for the Australian assurance to be announced. It was agreed that the Minister for External Affairs would keep in touch with the Prime Minister concerning the public release of the assurance.</p>

<p>The Cabinet also asked—</p>

<p>(a) that in view of the commitment which Australia has to the United States Administration to consult in respect of ANZUS obligations, a message should immediately be sent to that Administration referring to the proposed assurance to Malaysia, and allowing time for United States’ reactions to be received and considered before the assurance is conveyed;<a href="#f3">3</a></p>

<p>(b) that the New Zealand Government be informed of the Australian attitude in relation to assistance in defensive measures which may be required so that as far as possible Australia and New Zealand may be in step.<a href="#f4">4</a></p>

<p>[NAA: A 1838, TS686/4/1 part 1]</p>

<p>1 A Malaysian Cabinet meeting of 3 September considered the question of a complaint against Indonesia in the Security Council and agreed that the matter should be submitted immediately on the condition that Malaysia had an assurance from the British Government that offensive action should be taken against Indonesia on Indonesian soil. Following the meeting, the Tunku sought assurances from Head, Critchley and Wade, ‘as a matter of urgency’, that Malaysia’s Commonwealth allies would support armed defensive measures against Indonesia if the Security Council failed to restrain Indonesia.</p>

<p>2 The British ‘agreement in principle’ to counter attack in the event of any further Indonesian aggression in Malaya or Singapore was given on 3 September, with the proviso that it was ‘absolutely essential that before any such counter attack is made the Malaysian Government should take matter to the Security Council and seek their moral support against Indonesian aggression’.</p>

<p>3 A message was sent on 4 September and US agreement ‘in principle’ to Australia’s proposed assurance to Malaysia was received in Canberra on 5 September.</p>

<p>4 New Zealand was informed on 4 September.</p>
