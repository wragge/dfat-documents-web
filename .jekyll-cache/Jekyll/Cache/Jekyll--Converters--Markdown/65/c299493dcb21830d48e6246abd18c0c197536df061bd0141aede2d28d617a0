<p>SECRET IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>CONTROL AND OCCUPATION OF JAPAN It will be seen from my telegram of today D.1481 [1] that we are proposing the inclusion of Australia in a Control Council for Japan of which other members would be the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China. If time had permitted, we should have consulted the Commonwealth Government before putting this particular proposal to the United States. We assume however, that it is in accordance with the general wishes of the Commonwealth Government on this subject as conveyed in your recent telegrams.</p>
