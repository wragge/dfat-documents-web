<p>No 889. CONFIDENTIAL IMMEDIATE</p>

<ol>
  <li>At my meeting with Mr Anthony this afternoon I asked if he would comment on his colleagues attitude to CER following your recent visit [to] Australia. While he did not answer the question directly Mr Anthony said that the trip was well timed, ‘had helped set a tone’ and did a lot of good forCER. Mr Anthony also said that he had heard no adverse comments and helped modify concerns.</li>
  <li>In a reference to the recent Australian Cabinet decision on CER Mr Anthony observed that he had ‘got what (the decision) he wanted to proceed when there might have been difficulties’.</li>
  <li>Mr Anthony was positive about CER and said that once minds are made up things should be done quickly-without being politically stupid. In his view undue delay now would do no good and investment programmes on both sides of the Tasman need some certainty or they would be adversely affected.</li>
