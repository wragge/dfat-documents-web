I"3<p>Colombo, 26 February 1951</p>

<p>103.</p>

<p>Thank you for your telegram 77.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I shall be glad to fit in with your suggestion but would recommend against more than a brief visit to Karachi while Government’s economic officials are pre-occupied with E.C.A.F.E. and its aftermath.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I therefore suggest the following itinerary.</p>

<p>(a) Depart Colombo for New Delhi March 2nd.</p>

<p>(b) Leave New Delhi approximately March 8th or 9th.</p>

<p>(c) Consult briefly with Said Hasan Secretary Department Economic Affairs at Lahore on the value of visit to Karachi.</p>

<p>(d) Return to Singapore via Karachi—length of stay in Pakistan being determined by advice of Said Hasan.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>(e) Visit Indonesia by March 15th at the latest so as to be in a position to encourage participation in Colombo Plan at the time decision will be made.</p>
