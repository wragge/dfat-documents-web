<p>MOST SECRET IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>There has been nothing during the last few days beyond what the Dominions Office sending plus the views I have already expressed.</p>

<p>I have been pressing for discussions with a view to preparation of appreciation referred to in my telegram 302 [1] but owing to pressure of general situation and debate in the House of Commons [2] have been unable to make progress.</p>

<p>Reference debate, opinion here has been hardening since the Prime Minister’s statement last Thursday. [3] The Government and particularly the Prime Minister in extremely difficult position and while the Government will probably have substantial majority in division which now challenged I feel the possibility of dramatic political developments in future cannot be eliminated.</p>

<p>Norway. Notwithstanding better reports today as to prospects of capturing Narvik in the near future my doubts and anxieties already conveyed persist.</p>

<p>Netherlands. Latest reports discount the probability of early attack but disquieting reports are being received as to likelihood of move in South-East Europe.</p>

<p>Italy. Latest reports confirm that immediate action unlikely and more reassuring information as to the Spanish attitude has been received from the Ambassador at Madrid. [4]</p>
