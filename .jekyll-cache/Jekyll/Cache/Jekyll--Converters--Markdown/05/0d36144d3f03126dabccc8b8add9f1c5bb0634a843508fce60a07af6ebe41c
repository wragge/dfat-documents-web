<p>FEC 276 TRADE UNIONS.</p>

<p>1. Committee on democratic tendencies today unanimously adopted C4-009/8 with one minor alteration. Comes before steering committee 4 November. Australia took a leading part in the formulation of this paper and held chairmanship of the sub- committee which prepared it. Unless instructed to the contrary we shall support the paper in its final form.</p>

<p>2. Your attention however is particularly directed to paragraph 16. This was inserted to prevent Zaibatsu, other employers, and militaristic and undemocratic societies from subsidizing or otherwise controlling unions, which was a common practice in prewar Japan.</p>
