I"Æ<p>Draft Cablegram [111] [1] n.d. [30 December 1937]</p>

<p>His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is of the opinion that His Excellency the Govem6r-General [2] on his approaching visit to England leaving Australia in March might with great advantage pay an official visit to the Governor-General of the Netherlands Indies. Such a visit would in our opinion be a gesture of goodwill and do muchâ€™ to, cement the Present cordial relations between the British Commonwealth and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>[3] His Excellency heartily agrees with the proposal and is anxious to further the objective mentioned.</p>

<p>An informal approach to this end has been made to the Governor- General of the Netherlands Indies through the Consul-General in Australia [4], and an intimation has been received in the form of an invitation that the proposed visit would be cordially welcomed.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, His Excellency the Governor-General would be pleased if you would arrange for his acceptance of this kind invitation to be conveyed to the Netherlands Government through the appropriate channel.</p>
