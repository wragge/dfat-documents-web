<p>Djokjakarta Radio accuses Dutch of having sent planes to strafe population of Bandjarnegora, in Central Java, on 30th October and 4th November, killing seven civilians and injuring others.</p>

<p>Challenge which these attacks constitute to latest Security Council resolution has been pointed out by General Soedirman. [1] Dutch apparently claim these measures were taken in retaliation against killing of four Dutch soldiers by land-mine allegedly fired by Republican Army personnel.</p>

<p>2. Such incidents as these are in our view direct challenge to authority of your Committee, and seem to call for investigation and vigorous protest. What is Committee doing?</p>
