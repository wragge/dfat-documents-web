<p>EMERGENCY TOP SECRET</p>

<p>For the Minister and Secretary alone.</p>

<p>I learn from a secret but absolutely sure source that a Dutch Army - engineered crisis threatens in Indonesia.</p>

<p>2. The Dutch profess alarm at the skilful infiltration of their areas in recent weeks which is credited with the object of claiming these as T.N.I.-occupied territories when opportunity offers to announce their presence. To meet this situation the Dutch Army Command is recommending to Lovink today or tomorrow that either, (a) a third police action must be envisaged, or (b) the Dutch must retire to prepared positions.</p>

<p>The Dutch Army morale is said to be low.</p>

<p>3. Somer, head of the Dutch Military Intelligence, has stated that Lovink is preparing a noose for his own throat with his pro- Indonesia policy and he, Somer, together with like-minded colleagues, is determined to see Lovink [1] himself. In general the intention of die-hard elements is to sabotage The Hague talks, which it is understood are not going well at the moment because financial questions seem evident.</p>
