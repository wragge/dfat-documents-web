<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>United States Lend-Lease authorities here are anxious to know urgently how lend-lease aid to Australia can be stepped up in the most effective way. They ask for a report within 24 hours for the Presidentâ€™s [1] information. In the existing circumstances they expect to get additional Congressional appropriation much sooner than had been anticipated.</p>

<p>I am asked the following broad question. What can be done by lendlease aid from here to increase Australian war effort on the munitions side? All concerned here will produce the most comprehensive report possible based on the information that we have. I have said our report will be best we can do in the time but that it will have to be supplemented as soon as possible by additional information from Australia which no doubt you will telegraph urgently.</p>

<p>I suggest including such basic requirements as mining machinery for increased production of metals necessary for munitions expansion.</p>

<p>Outline information from you in 48 hours will be more valuable here than more detailed information at a later date, although the latter will be necessary as follow up.</p>

<p>CASEY</p>

<p>1 Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
