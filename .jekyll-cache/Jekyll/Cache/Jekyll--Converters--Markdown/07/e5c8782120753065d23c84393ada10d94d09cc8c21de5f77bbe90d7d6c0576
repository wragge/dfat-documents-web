<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your D.2016 [2] and D.2125. [3]</p>

<p>We agree with the principle of Trusteeship for a period which should be terminated when U.N.O. Assembly, acting on advice of Trusteeship Council, determines Korea is fit for independence. We think, however, that United Nations Trusteeship would be far preferable to a four-power arrangement. This would be compatible with the suggestion for Advisory Council, but the Advisory Council should consist either of the Nations members of the Far Eastern Commission or at least of five powers including Australia.</p>

<p>Proposed settlement of Italian colonies practically agreed to in London included United Nations trusteeship. A four power trusteeship is undesirable and opposed to our general policy in Pacific affairs.</p>
