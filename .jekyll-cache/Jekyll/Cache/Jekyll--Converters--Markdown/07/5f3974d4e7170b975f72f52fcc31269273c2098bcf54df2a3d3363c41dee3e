<p>PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram. [1] Most confidential.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that it is important that our war aims should be stated as fully and clearly as possible at an early date.</p>

<p>A more urgent need is for much fuller publicity here as to our war effort and life under war conditions written, pictorial and on the movies. At present the Germans are away ahead of us in any department and this is undoubtedly having a subtle effect on opinion otherwise friendly to us and possibly a more serious result on that section who are somewhat detached. Anything you could do in London to urge this would be useful.</p>
