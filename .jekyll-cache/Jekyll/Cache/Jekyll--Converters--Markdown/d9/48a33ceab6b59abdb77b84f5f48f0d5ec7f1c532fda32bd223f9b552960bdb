I"‰<p>London, 22 April 1973</p>

<p>Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Prime Ministerâ€“Queen Discussions</strong></p>

<p>The Prime Minister telephoned me from Windsor on 21st April, 10.00 a.m.</p>

<p>He referred to his discussions with the Queen on the previous evening as having been good and very friendly.</p>

<p>In brief the outcome was as follows:â€“</p>

<p>(a) Royal style and titles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) â€˜Of Australia and her other realms and territories, Queenâ€™</p>

  <p>Yes, perfectly agreeable.</p>

  <p>(ii) â€˜Elizabethâ€™â€”not â€˜Elizabeth 11â€™</p>

  <p>Not favoured by The Queen.</p>

  <p>(iii) â€˜By the grace of Godâ€™</p>

  <p>The Queen would wish to let it stand.</p>

  <p>(iv) â€˜Defender of the faithâ€™</p>

  <p>Would â€˜not matterâ€™ if it were dropped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Coinage: â€˜Elizabethâ€™</p>

<p>The Prime Minister did not mention this in view of the outcome of (a) (ii) above.</p>

<p>(c) Renaming High Commissioners as Ambassadors</p>

<p>Not mentioned.</p>

<p>(d) Relations with the States on, e.g. appointment of Governors, award of Honours, matters about flags</p>

<p>Not mentioned.</p>

<p>(e) Letters of Credence</p>

<p>The Queen has a strong wish to continue signing the Letters, but would probably see no difficulty on the other aspects, e.g., the nomination of our Ambassadors and agrÃ¨ment for other countries.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said he was giving me this report in anticipation of my discussion later in the day with Charteris.</p>

<p>He imagined Charteris would have a similar report.</p>

<p>He would like to see what progress Charteris and I could make.</p>
