<p>Received 21 September 1940, 6.21 a.m.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT</p>

<p>Have received formal protest from â€˜DUMONT Dâ€™URVILLEâ€™ claiming violation of French territorial waters. Have replied ship remains at official request of Government of New Caledonia and cannot agree that under present circumstances any violation of neutral rights is involved. SAUTOT [1] has informed British Consul [2] that he expects written reply by 0400 Z to his request that â€˜DUMONT Dâ€™URVILLEâ€™ depart from Noumea at 0700 Z today Saturday.</p>

<p>Situation ashore still unstable mainly due to presence of â€˜DUMONT Dâ€™URVILLEâ€™ and lack of any military officer above rank of Lieutenant to give active assistance to SAUTOT.</p>

<p>1 Free French Governor of New Caledonia.</p>
