<p>284. 217. Secret</p>

<p>Please pass following letter from me to Dr. Subandrio:</p>

<p>Begins:â€”</p>

<p>I am deeply disturbed that no progress was made at the Bangkok meeting which has just concluded.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>I must tell you that I believe the attitude of the Malaysian Government in declining to negotiate on political questions while Indonesian guerillas not only remained on Malaysian territory but were being re-inforced by your Government, seems to me was correct and the only attitude they could have adopted in the circumstances. Malaysia had agreed to meet Indonesia at a time when the Indonesian Government was still proclaiming its intention to â€˜crush Malaysiaâ€™. This seemed to me a most considerable concession for them to make. But there are limits to which any Government can go and still retain its self respect. The continued invasion of their territory by a neighbour in clear breach of the United Nations Charter is clearly such a limit. The view that terms should be offered for the withdrawal of forces gratuitously intruded into the territory of a neighbour is surely inadmissible and one which on reflection no nation including Indonesia could be asked to accept. As one who has striven for friendship with Indonesia I most earnestly counsel you to desist from these dangerous and indefensible courses.</p>

<p>I send you this letter because I shall shortly be obliged to speak publicly in the Australian Parliament in the same sense.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>Ends.</p>
