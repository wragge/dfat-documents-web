<p>Confidential</p>

<p>I rang Sir Keith Waller to tell him the subject matter of the call on me by the Ambassador of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>He spoke to me of this morning’s Defence Committee Meeting.</p>

<p>I then spoke about Australia House.</p>

<p>I said I had received the Minister’s letter from the Prime Minister. <a href="#f1">1</a> He had given me one or two brief comments and had asked me to consider the kind of reply.</p>

<p>Sir Keith said the letter was Mr Bowen’s own letter, drafted in Sydney.</p>

<p>I said I was working for the two Ministers to come together on the points of difference.</p>

<p>Sir Keith said he was not hoping for this outcome. He did not want to have Australia House.</p>
