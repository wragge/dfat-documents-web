<p>Received 20 August 1947</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>The following urgent message has been received by this Department from the High Commissioner, Suva:-</p>

<p>Native trouble in British Solomon Islands Protectorate is likely to reach climax on September 1st when clash between opposing factions is threatened. [1]</p>

<p>It is necessary to effect arrest before that date and presence of a warship would have a steadying effect.</p>

<p>I should therefore be most grateful if Warramunga could arrange to reach Point Cruz Guadalcanal on or before August 28th and stand by. Glad of very early reply.</p>

<p>2. It had been previously arranged for Warramunga to arrive 3rd September. Arrangements can be made for her to arrive 28th August as requested. Request early approval. Message ends.</p>

<p>1 Disaffection based on activities of the nationalist group â€˜Marching Ruleâ€™ included attempts to secure higher wages, defiance of district officers and â€˜cargo cultâ€™ beliefs. J.F. Nicoll, Acting High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, feared the trouble would come to a head on 1 September, when, according to rumours aggravated by the presence of US troops and naval vessels in the area, the United States would take over administration of the islands.</p>
