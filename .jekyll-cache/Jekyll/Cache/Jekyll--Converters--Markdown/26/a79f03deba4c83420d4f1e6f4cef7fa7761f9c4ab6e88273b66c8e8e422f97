<p>We are still in favour of retention of international control as expressed in our 1313. However, we do not wish to take a strong minority stand against the Chinese Government on this issue. If, therefore, the situation remains as suggested in your 1509 and advocacy of retention of international control would definitely place us in a minority, you should acquiesce in the modified C.C.F.E. proposals.
