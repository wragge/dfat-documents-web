<p>As you know, Republican Government has become increasingly apprehensive of resumption of police action by the Dutch. Despite all efforts to impress on the Dutch the serious consequences of such a step, we continue to receive reliable reports that they are contemplating further police action. This serves to emphasise imperative need for continued United States firmness towards the Dutch. Please advise United States appreciation of position.</p>
