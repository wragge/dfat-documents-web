<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Please convey the following message to Marshall from Minister:-</p>

<p>Begins: A short meeting at a governmental level during the early part of the Assembly would, in my view, be suitable providing matter is then pressed forward.</p>

<p>I am sending to Ambassador Butler confidential report concerning present British Commonwealth discussions on Japanese settlement so that he may communicate it to yourself. I am happy to advise you that discussions have revealed not only that all Governments are approaching the subject along parallel lines, but also in the way in which I believe your Government would fully approve in principle.</p>

<p>I am leaving Australia for the United States on Thursday next. I am looking forward to seeing you in New York where I can give you a full report and I hope to have the honour of working with you to achieve a speedy, just and stable settlement.</p>

<p>Personal regards.</p>

<p>Ends.</p>
