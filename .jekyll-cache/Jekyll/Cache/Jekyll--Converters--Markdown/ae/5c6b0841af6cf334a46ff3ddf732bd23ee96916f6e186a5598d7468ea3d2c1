<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Immediately on my return from Djokjakarta Monday evening Dubois and I received a letter from Van Mook in the following terms:-</p>

<p>(1) He does not share our hope that our working paper [1] might prove useful in any conversation between Hatta and himself.</p>

<p>(2) Neither the Committee nor individual members of the Committee should make pronouncements except at the request of both parties.</p>

<p>(3) Documents and especially confidential documents emanating from individual members of the Good Offices Committee cannot be included in report of the Committee as such.</p>

<p>(4) On instructions from his Government neither the Netherlands Delegation nor himself can see their way to take the paper into consideration. [2]</p>
