I"'<p>Cablegram E4 WASHINGTON, 21 March 1945, 6.15 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>1. Please arrange with Dalziel [1] immediate delivery of copy of Foreign Policy book to each member of Cabinet with a slip stating ‘with my compliments’. Please give three copies to the Prime Minister and Beasley and see my wire immediately following to Beasley.</p>

<p>Please convey to Macmahon Ball my warmest regards for his most helpful and timely introductions. [2]</p>

<p>2. I regard the United States answer on the employment conference a great triumph for Australia - New Zealand policy, especially having in mind the strong disinclination of the United States Government to recognise the importance of full employment. [3] I propose to handle the matter including the consideration of a reply in Washington.</p>

<p>3. On the Portuguese matter [4], think it would be unwise to have Portuguese troops in Australia. I do not see why we should pull their chestnuts out of the fire. Please discuss this aspect of the matter with Shedden.</p>

<p>4. Please have review of my book in Current Notes. [5]</p>
