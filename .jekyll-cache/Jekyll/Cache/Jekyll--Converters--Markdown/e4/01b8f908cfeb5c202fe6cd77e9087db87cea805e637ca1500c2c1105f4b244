<p>MOST IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Strong feeling that in the near future Hitler [1] will attempt a strong peace offensive; even being suggested that he might indicate preparedness to resign in Goeringâ€™s [2] favour if this would assist the re-establishment of peace. This suggestion probably nonsense but in my view he will go almost any length to create the impression that continuance of the war is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Delay involved in this manoeuvre renders attack on the Western Front unlikely before the winter but intensive air offensive would be substituted.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Adolf Hitler, German Chancellor.</p>

<p>2 General Hermann Goring, German Minister for Air and Commander- in-Chief of German Air Force.</p>
