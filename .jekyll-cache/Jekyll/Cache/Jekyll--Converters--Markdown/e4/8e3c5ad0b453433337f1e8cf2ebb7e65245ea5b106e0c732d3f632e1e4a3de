<p>2 The Secretary-General’s report contained two critical references: (a) that there might have been less misunderstanding among the other parties to the Manila agreement ‘if the date could have been fixed after [his] conclusions had been reached and made known’; and that the facilities granted to the observers did not meet those requested.</p>
