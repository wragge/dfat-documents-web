I"*<p>London, 30 October 1972</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me advance notice through Alec Downer of the decision you announced on 25 November [sic] about the transfer of responsibility for Australia House.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>I appreciate especially your statement that this decision would not change in any way the very close relationship between our two countries. I fully agree. I am also glad to know that you intend to continue to give the British High Commissioner in Canberra the right of direct access to you. I shall of course follow the same practice with your High Commissioner in London.</p>

<p>We shall miss Alec Downer, who has made so many friends in London, and are glad to hear that we may expect to see him here from time to time.</p>
