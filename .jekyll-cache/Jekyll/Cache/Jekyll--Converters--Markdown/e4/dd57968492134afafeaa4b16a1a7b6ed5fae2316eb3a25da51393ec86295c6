<p>MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL DECIPHER YOURSELF</p>

<p>Please give following message to Prime Minister [1] for his most secret and personal information:-</p>

<p>Begins.-Messages conveyed in my telegrams circular Z. No. 104 [2] and circular Z. No. 77 [3] give appreciation of position as we see it. Further appreciation is in preparation and will be sent in a few hours time. It seems dear that at any moment we may be faced by French collapse and consequent necessity for taking grave and far-reaching decisions. In these circumstances we are very anxious to have full expression of Dominion Governmentsâ€™ views on the position as they see it at present, so that all factors may be before us. We should be grateful if you could telegraph at the earliest possible moment after receipt of further appreciation referred to.</p>
