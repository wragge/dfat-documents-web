I"Þ<p>Letter WASHINGTON, 5 June 1944</p>

<p>I refer to Mr. Winantâ€™s letter to me of 4th May [1], in which he enquired whether I would be disposed to hold exploratory talks on postwar international aviation in Washington on my return from London.</p>

<p>Under date 13th May I sent an interim reply. [2] I now desire to confirm that it would not be practicable for me to arrange for Australia to be represented at the suggested talks at the present time. I shall however examine the matter immediately on my arrival in Australia and will advise you further as soon as I am able.</p>
