I"Š<p>Cablegram 101 WASHINGTON, 28 May 1940</p>

<p>I discussed New Zealand Prime Ministerâ€™s message [1] with the President [2] today. He asked that his thanks be conveyed to Mr.</p>

<p>Fraser. President is clearly unable in circumstances to make formal reply [3] but I suggest that Fraser be informed by completely safe means of gist of my No. 100. [4]</p>

<p>2 Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

<p>3 Roosevelt did in fact reply formally to Fraser through Casey (see Wellesâ€™s letter to Casey of 1 June 1940 on file AA: A3300, 46).</p>
