<p>Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Without Submissionâ€”Prime Ministerâ€™s speech on Thursday, 13 Mayâ€”Reference to P.R.C.</strong></p>

<p>The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of developments in the matter of the admission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China to the United Nationsâ€”as reported in cables received by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the past few days.</p>

<p>2. He expressed the view that Australia would need to make known earlier than the Cabinet previously had in mind its willingness to enter into dialogue with the P.R.C. He proposed that in the circumstances he should take the opportunity of a speech he would be making at the Citizens Dinner in Sydney on Thursday, 13 May, to give an indication of flexibilityâ€”though still of course a full sense of careâ€”in the Governmentâ€™s approach.</p>

<p>3. The Cabinet endorsed this proposal.</p>
