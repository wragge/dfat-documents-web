<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your D.2115 [1], Siam.</p>

<p>We appreciate manner in which we have been kept informed of the course of negotiations with Siam and of the reception accorded by S.E.A.C. Headquarters to Colonel A. J. Eastman, Australian Services Representative with S.A.C.S.E.A.â€™s forces in Siam. [2] Colonel Eastman is aware of Australiaâ€™s interests in Siam.</p>

<p>2. Eastman has reported that Dening while aware Australiaâ€™s desire to be party principal in negotiations has received no instructions. We would again express our wish that Australia should be a party principal in contemplated agreements with Siam.</p>

<p>We should like to see as soon as possible final drafts of these agreements. In the meantime we should be glad to continue to receive from you advice as to the attitude of the United Kingdom and other powers concerned in the settlements.</p>

<p>3. We should be grateful if arrangements could be made to enable Col. Eastman to participate as Australian Government Representative in the negotiations with the Siamese Delegation.</p>
