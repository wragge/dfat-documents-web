<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Thank you for your telegram No. 81. [1]</p>

<p>I agree that the pending Assembly discussion has been a useful pressure, and that our difficulties may increase after the session. For this reason and in order to solidify the Republican movement, it might be an advantage if the Assembly were to debate briefly the Indonesian question and (a). To note with satisfaction the preliminary accord [2]</p>

<p>(b). Urge an early final agreement on the basis of the preliminary accord and the Security Councilâ€™s resolution. [3]</p>

<p>(c). Refer to the Indonesian question to the next meeting of the Assembly when the results of the joint conference could be considered.</p>

<p>2. I shall advise finally on staffing as soon as practicable but believe that the main consideration will be addition of a Vice Consul to the Consulate so Pritchett may relieve Cutts to the end of July.</p>
