<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>For your urgent consideration and reply. I am a good deal exercised about projected visit to Great Britain as political position here precarious and principal lieutenants in Cabinet not very experienced. However I feel strongly that much mutual benefit might result from visit provided I could be sure of prompt and sufficient opportunity for consultation with Churchill and chief Ministers.</p>

<p>Would be glad if you could frankly give me idea of value of visit and also ascertain from Churchill whether this is a convenient time for him. In particular I feel that clear definition where we stand in the Far East and reasonably long range policy of Middle East would enable me to plan Australian effort on man-power side more soundly. Also interested to give United Kingdom Government a clear picture of amazing munitions potential developed and developing here and to see how far greater joint use could be arranged. But as always I will be much influenced by your own opinion. Regards</p>
