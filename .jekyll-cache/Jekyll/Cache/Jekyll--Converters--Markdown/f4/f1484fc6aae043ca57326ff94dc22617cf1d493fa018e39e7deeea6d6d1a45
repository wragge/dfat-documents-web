<p>Reference para 1 of your 4370 [1] To avoid possible misunderstanding, we wish to make it clear that letter given by Sjahrir to Brookes [2] was addressed to Brookes personally and did not contain specific request to Australian Government to raise Indonesian question in United Nations. it stated that Indonesian Cabinet had unanimously agreed to proposal by Sjahrir that Australian Government could be approached and asked whether Brookes could do something along those lines. Kirby subsequently advised that he understood Sjahrir intended to indicate he might make a formal request to Australia if and when his counter proposals were turned down by the Dutch. [3]</p>

<p>2. For your information, Copland advises that Vice Foreign Minister, Liu, referred to deaths of Chinese in Indonesia, suggested political settlement in Indonesia should be expedited, and enquired whether Australia would be interested in participating in any such move. He also hinted at mediation or reference of problem to Security Council. Copland made no comment.</p>

<p>3. Early advice would be appreciated regarding present position in connection with our telegram 243 of 14th June to Dominions Office [4] concerning trial of Indonesians accused of murdering Australians.</p>

<p>1 Dispatched 21 June.
