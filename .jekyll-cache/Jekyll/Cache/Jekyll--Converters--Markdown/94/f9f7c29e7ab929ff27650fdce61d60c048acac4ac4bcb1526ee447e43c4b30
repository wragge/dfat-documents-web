<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>From the concrete results achieved and the reports in the Press you will have appreciated Evattâ€™s [1] success here.</p>

<p>There is little that I could add to his very comprehensive report to you on the results of his mission. Bearing these results in mind, I think that he has been wise in making his visit brief and concentrated, though it must have taken a heavy toll of his energy. He worked unceasingly both night and day.</p>

<p>Since his departure I have heard many comments on his visit. On every hand I have found them favourable. To my mind the most satisfactory feature is the attitude in Governmental and Press circles. Both were inclined to regard him before his arrival with a certain measure of suspicion. This has disappeared and has been replaced by a feeling of friendly regard. This changed atmosphere will undoubtedly be helpful not only to the Government but to Australia as a whole. It was remarkable how quickly Evatt sensed the atmosphere here.</p>

<p>His broadcast given within a few days of his arrival was admirable. While presenting Australiaâ€™s case with force and directness he had regard to the susceptibilities of these somewhat difficult and certainly harrassed and war-worn people and so won their sympathy and understanding for Australia. The note he struck in that first broadcast he maintained throughout his visit.</p>

<p>I realise it is not for me to comment on the performance of Ministers but I felt you would like me to send you personally my views.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Minister for External Affairs.</p>
