<p>You will, of course, strongly oppose any United States move for reference to Court [1] as suggested in press. [2] It is another means of delaying and by-passing Council. The fact that Council had already made a decision on 1st August and admitted parties for hearing means matter was regarded then as within jurisdiction and reference to Court at this stage can be interpreted as attempt to circumvent decision of Council on a par with use of the veto.</p>
