<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your 361. [1]</p>

<p>Have noted your views in paragraph 4. We note with some surprise your emphasis on the need for early establishment of Joint Police Force, and would like to know your reasons for this conclusion.</p>

<p>Our impression has been that establishment of Joint Police Force is not only impracticable now that matters have gone so far, but might also provide Dutch in future with opportunity to extend their influence at expense of Indonesians in contravention of whatever settlement may ultimately be reached.</p>

<p>2. Agree with your first proposal in para. 10. We propose to use your aircraft to fly majority of party to Batavia, even if some members have to travel by civil aircraft.</p>

<p>3. Arrangements being made to replenish your liquor supply. If possible consignment will be flown up in your aircraft.</p>

<p>4. Do not consider necessary Australian military observers be attached to the Commission.</p>
