I"®<p>Cablegram 30, CANBERRA, 28 April 1948</p>

<p>Following matters should be given attention in drafting report to General Assembly:</p>

<p>(i) extent of Committeeâ€™s activities in pursuance of its functions of conciliation and results;</p>

<p>(ii) nature of evidence presented by observation groups and reliability of conclusions.</p>

<p>We cannot be a party to any conclusions reached on the basis of â€˜suppositionsâ€™ or any grounds other than proven evidence, and if drafting committee cannot be persuaded to our point of view specific reservations should be entered in each instance. You should endeavour to gain support of Pakistan and others who have adhered to a similar point of view.</p>

<p>In general, report should be a factual account without attempting to allocate blame or responsibility. The proper authority for any such pronouncement is the Assembly itself.</p>
