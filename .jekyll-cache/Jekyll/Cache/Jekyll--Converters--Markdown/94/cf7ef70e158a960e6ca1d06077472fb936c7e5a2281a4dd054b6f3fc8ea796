I"<p>Cablegram K187 BATAVIA, 7 November 1948, 3.11 p.m.</p>

<p>Republican Delegation has replied [1] to the Netherlands letter transmitted by Cochran (see my telegram No. K182 [2]). The Republic notes with satisfaction the Netherlands wish for an early resumption of negotiations. It agrees on the desirability of a full implementation of the truce, but cannot accept Netherlands accusation that the Republic is responsible for failures to date.</p>

<p>The Republican Delegation is ready to discuss the question of truce implementation. On the other hand it stresses that the delay in reaching a political settlement imposes additional strain on the truce. The Republican Delegation therefore suggests that truce and political discussions proceed concurrently and points out that this is possible under the Committeeâ€™s normal procedure of working through five main committees.</p>

<p>The reply was transmitted to the Netherlands Delegation last night.</p>
