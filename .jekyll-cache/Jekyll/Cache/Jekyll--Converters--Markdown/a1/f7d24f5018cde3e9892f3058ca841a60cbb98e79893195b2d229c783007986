I"P<p>Cablegram 11 LONDON, 5 January [1940], 7.10 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Dominions Office have forwarded by official</p>

<p>despatch [1] which should reach you about 15th January letters</p>

<p>exchanged on 20th December between Halifax [2] and Benes [3] with</p>

<p>regard to the formation of a Czechoslovak national committee of</p>

<p>which Benes is actually though not technically the president. In</p>

<p>his letter Halifax, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government,</p>

<p>‘[recognises] [4] that the committee is qualified to represent the</p>

<p>Czechoslovak peoples’, in particular for the purposes of the</p>

<p>reconstruction of the Czechoslovak army in France.</p>

<p>Hitherto the United Kingdom Government has been careful to</p>

<p>distinguish between Bohemia and Moravia on the one hand and</p>

<p>Slovakia on the other.</p>

<p>Their attitude, however, is that the step just taken does not</p>

<p>really constitute any change in policy, that they do not at</p>

<p>present propose to enter into any commitments regarding the future</p>

<p>status or boundaries of any territories included in the former</p>

<p>Czechoslovak state, and that the phrase ‘Czechoslovak peoples’ in</p>

<p>plural was adopted to leave open the question of the future status</p>

<p>and mutual relations of the Czechs and Slovaks. They state that</p>

<p>action was taken for three reasons:-</p>

<p>(1) to encourage resistance of the Czech and Slovak peoples to</p>

<p>Germany;</p>

<p>(2) to keep in step with the French Government who had already</p>

<p>recognised the national committee of [13th November];</p>

<p>(3) to take account of public feeling aroused here and in the</p>

<p>Dominions and in neutral countries by the treatment inflicted upon</p>

<p>the Czechs and Slovaks in Germany.</p>

<p>Of these (3) [5] was clearly the deciding factor. I cannot help</p>

<p>feeling that present step will be construed abroad as an intention</p>

<p>to reconstruct former state of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>British Minister in Hungary [6] for instance considered the change</p>

<p>‘a matter of the greatest moment to the Hungarian Government’ and</p>

<p>urgently requested instructions as to what line he should take</p>

<p>with them.</p>

<p>Benes is coming to see me next week having in mind similar</p>

<p>recognition by Australia. I will be entirely non-committal.</p>
