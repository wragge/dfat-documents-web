<p>PERSONAL IMMEDIATE FOR MELVILLE ALONE FROM MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS SECRET</p>

<p>1. I must express great disappointment in your 44. [2] I can imagine the pressure to which you must be subjected from many quarters, but you were fully warned and I would like you to inform me privately through Stirling the External Affairs Officer whether you have discussed my telegram [3] with any other person. I asked you previously to communicate with me through this channel in order that you could inform me frankly and without reserve what the various attitudes are. In particular I desire to know whether Bruce is participating in any way.</p>

<p>2. I am discussing commercial policy and other matters with the sub-committee [4] early next week and meanwhile the following detailed comments will help you to know probable attitude.</p>

<p>(a) I disagree with your interpretation of Article VII except in the sense that elimination of preferences may ultimately result from a long-term policy of full employment, increased standards and a series of commodity arrangements. To commence with such elimination puts the cart before the horse. Our employment approach demonstrates the true principle.</p>

<p>(b) Supposed intentions of the United States of America as interpreted by United Kingdom or Canadian officials are a poor foundation on which to base present tactics. The United States of America with United Kingdom assistance refused bilateral arrangement with Australia. [5] Moreover even if this report of United States of America attitude is correct the fact is that the United States of America can hardly press for honouring a commitment in relation to preferences if as stated by Keynes (see your 31 paragraph 1(iii) and paragraph 7 [6]) they are not prepared to honour the all-important obligation to maintain employment.</p>

<p>(c) Your reference to Ottawa agreement [7] is noted. No British Government would live if it terminated Ottawa agreement against wishes of Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>(d) Primary industries are of equal concern to this Government as secondary industries and before any expression of views we will wish to know far more about post-war markets, British and European and American agricultural policies and assurance of rising levels of consumption.</p>

<p>(e) The final summary of your view in paragraph 3 expresses a view that some reduction of preferences is inevitable under the Mutual Aid Agreement. Your delegation has no authority whatever for saying so. It is expressly contrary to your instructions [8] which also include the Australian - New Zealand firm Agreement on interpretation of Article VII which specifically mentions â€˜British Commonwealth Preferencesâ€™ as a measure we may have to retain. I suggest you should frankly but firmly remind your co-delegates that they must assist you in carrying out Government instructions.</p>

<p>3. Full text of my statement on Canadian agreement has been repeated to you. [9] This is also in accordance with Government policy although of necessity it could not be quite so specific as Australian New Zealand Agreement on economic collaboration. [10]</p>

<p>4. I especially desire to know whether New Zealand delegates have acted in accordance with such agreement.</p>
