I"Ž	<p>Port Moresby, 2 September 1966</p>

<p>I refer to your personal letter of 16 August, 1966 about squatting in the Gazelle Peninsula.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>[ <em>matter omitted</em> ]</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a high proportion of the best land in the Gazelle Peninsula has been alienated and that there is considerable population pressure on land in many parts of the Peninsula. There is also no doubt that whether legally right or wrong there is a considerable feeling of injustice among the native people there and a mounting unrest. Major and continued force would certainly be necessary in some instances if we tried to move all squatters. In commenting on the Talakua situation<a href="#f2">2</a> the District Commissioner, East New Britain<a href="#f3">3</a> made the following statement which is of much more general import:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Successful ejectment would encourage other land title holders to eject apparent squatters from many properties scattered through the Gazelle Peninsula. There is a danger that such a series of actions would adversely affect the native situation in respect to land. At present the detente reached between native and non-native land disputants achieved by the long period of awaiting the hearing of Appeals has led to the situation where reasonableness and negotiation is possible in many cases. A few cases involving the use of force and loss of substantial improvements, could quickly return us to the days a few years ago when neither confidence nor communication was possible between the Administration and the native people on land matters. Everybody should be made aware of this.â€™</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have thought for some time that a comprehensive enquiry is needed in the Gazelle Peninsula to examine the total land position there and discover exactly what costs or concessions would be necessary to resolve all outstanding Appeals, claims and alleged injustices. I understand Mr. S. Smith of the Land Titles Commission is engaged at present on special duties which may go some way towards providing at least part of this information.</p>
