<p>B.B.C. short wave broadcast Sunday, April 28th, included announcement that QUEEN MARY and AQUITANIA had arrived Capetown.</p>

<p>In view present location of these liners [1], such broadcasts must raise grave doubts reliability B.B.C. news, especially in Australia. This announcement also cabled to Australian press after having been passed by London censor.</p>

<p>We can only infer that B.B.C. being used by Admiralty for its own purpose but result is questioning by Australians of authenticity of British broadcasts and endless trouble for censorship authorities.</p>

<p>Incident indicates reversal British policy outlined your telegram April 12th [2], in which it is stated that the intention is that any news of arrival at or departure from ports within the jurisdiction of Allied censorship should be rigorously suppressed.</p>

<p>Impossible enforce this policy here if B.B.C. continues to issue bulletins concerning these liners.</p>

<p>1 Thew ships were in fact embarking troops in Australian and New Zealand ports.</p>
