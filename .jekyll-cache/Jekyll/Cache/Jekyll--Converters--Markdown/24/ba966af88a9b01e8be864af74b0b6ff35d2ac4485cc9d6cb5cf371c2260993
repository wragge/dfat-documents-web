<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Hatta is coming to Batavia on Thursday for personal discussions at the invitation of Van Mook.</p>

<p>2. Today the Netherlands Government are inaugurating the Provisional Interim Federal Government, without Republicans. The Republican attitude is- (a) The Provisional Government cannot be regarded as an Interim Government preceding formation of Federal Government of the United States of Indonesia, since it only concerns territories outside the Republic.</p>

<p>(b) Todayâ€™s proceedings stress the independent position of the Republic.</p>

<p>(c) Todayâ€™s inauguration should in no way prejudice the Republicâ€™s position with regard to the proposed negotiations with the Netherlands Government for the formation of an Interim Government over the whole of Indonesia.</p>
