I"R<p>Cablegram 12 CANBERRA, 11 January 1944</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>The Australian Government has been following closely your recent</p>

<p>telegrams on the situation in Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy and</p>

<p>much appreciates detailed advice of developments.</p>

<p>2. In general we fear that unless great care is taken Allies may</p>

<p>lay themselves open to the charge of endeavouring to return to the</p>

<p>pre war status quo in these countries and bolstering up old</p>

<p>regimes to which the majority of the populations concerned are</p>

<p>violently opposed.</p>

<p>3. YUGOSLAVIA</p>

<p>We fully realise the desirability of preserving the State of</p>

<p>Yugoslavia as an independent entity although all the trends are in</p>

<p>the direction of a loose-knit confederation consisting of at least</p>

<p>three and possibly five or six units.</p>

<p>At the same time we are extremely doubtful whether continued</p>

<p>British backing of the King of Yugoslavia [1] will help towards</p>

<p>Yugoslav unity. In this connection we note in particular the views</p>

<p>expressed by the Head of the British Military Mission to the</p>

<p>Partisan Movement [2], and the British Ambassador to the Yugoslav</p>

<p>Government [3] (D.O. tele gram 1182 of 27th December [4]) that</p>

<p>‘the dynasty would not be a unifying factor in Yugoslavia and its</p>

<p>return would be bitterly opposed by the majority of the nation’,</p>

<p>that ‘the King has been personally discredited in the eyes of the</p>

<p>Partisans’, and that ‘he is irreparably compromised with the</p>

<p>Partisans and a sudden volte face on his part at this stage would</p>

<p>not affect their attitude’.</p>

<p>With regard to General Mihailovitch [5] we have noted particularly</p>

<p>your telegram (D.1062 of 6th December [6]) giving your analysis of</p>

<p>his position stating that he ‘is not only of no military value to</p>

<p>the Allies but has also become a standing obstacle to any sort of</p>

<p>Yugoslav unity either now or in the near future’; and also Mr.</p>

<p>Churchill’s statement to the King of Yugoslavia on 10th December</p>

<p>that ‘we had irrefutable evidence that General Mihailovitch was</p>

<p>collaborating with the enemy’.</p>

<p>In the light of these views it seems to us that the time has come</p>

<p>to withdraw support finally from Mihailovitch and to consider very</p>

<p>serious ly whether it should not also be withdrawn from the King</p>

<p>and Government, henceforward concentrating support on Tito [7] and</p>

<p>his National Committee and allowing the question regarding the</p>

<p>monarchy to stand over for decision by the Yugoslav people after</p>

<p>the war. in particular we feel that it would be ineffective and</p>

<p>imprudent to send the King to Tito’s headquarters.</p>

<p>4. GREECE</p>

<p>With regard to Greece we welcome the steps that are being taken to</p>

<p>promote unity in Greek resistance but feel that here again as in</p>

<p>the case of Yugoslavia too much stress has been laid on the</p>

<p>position of the King. [8]</p>

<p>5. ITALY</p>

<p>With regard to Italy we are disturbed by the views recently ex</p>

<p>pressed by the British Minister to the Vatican [9] reported in</p>

<p>D.O.</p>

<p>Telegram D.3 of 1st January. [10] Bearing in mind our basic war</p>

<p>aims we feel that it is now desirable to strengthen the hands of</p>

<p>the democratic groups in Italy, with a view to formation of a</p>

<p>widely based and representative Government as early as possible.</p>

<p>10 In AA:A31?05, 1944, 1.219. The camblegram noted the U.K.</p>

<p>Minister’s view that Italians seemed to look to the Monarchy for</p>

<p>national stability and that parliamentary democracy was unlikely</p>

<p>to appeal to Italians for an appreciable time’.</p>
