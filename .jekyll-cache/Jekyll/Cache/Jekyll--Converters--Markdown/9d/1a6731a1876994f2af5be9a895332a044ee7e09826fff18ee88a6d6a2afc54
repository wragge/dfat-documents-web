<p>Europe and the Commonwealth</p>

<p>I sent you a message on 16th May<a href="#f2">2</a> about the progress of our work on the problem of the association of the United Kingdom with the Six. […] I attach the greatest importance as I know you do to our having the fullest and most effective consultation about this vital matter before my Government has to decide our course of action and I have been giving some thought about how this can best be done. There seems to be at the moment a more favourable climate of opinion on the Continent on this issue than there has been for some time. But this can easily change. We feel therefore that if we are to enter into negotiations there is advantage in doing so sooner rather than later. At the same time it would not be in the interests of any of us to enter into negotiations which were likely to break down at the outset. It is therefore necessary not merely to assess the advantages and disadvantages to us all but also to have in mind what might be a likely basis for agreement. This involves very great political and economic considerations both general and specific. We are of course examining closely the consequences for our own agriculture and the broader social implications of an association with the European Economic Community as well as the implications we see for the Commonwealth but we shall need your views on the political and economic problems involved. While consultation between our Governments can and will continue to take place through normal official channels I feel that we shall reach the stage within a matter of weeks when there should be more direct and personal discussion between Ministers.</p>

<p>What I have in mind therefore is that Duncan Sandys should visit you to discuss with you the advantages and disadvantages of our associating ourselves closer with Europe and the possible terms on which this might be acceptable to us and other members of the Commonwealth. He would be able to explain to you at first hand just how we see this problem in its wider political aspects as well as in its economic setting.</p>

<p>I thought you would like to know at once how I propose that this matter should be handled. I hope that you would agree that there need be no announcement about this arrangement until we can work out the timing for the visit and that these plans can be kept confidential until then.</p>
