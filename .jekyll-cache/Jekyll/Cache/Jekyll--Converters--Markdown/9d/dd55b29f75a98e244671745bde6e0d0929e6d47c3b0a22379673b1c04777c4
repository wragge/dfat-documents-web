I"C<p>CANBERRA, 19 April 1948</p>

<p>NOTE FOR FILE Draft resolution discussed with the Minister, 18/4/48.</p>

<p>His view is that there are procedural dangers in putting forward any resolution re-affirming the decision of the last General Assembly on Palestine, as such a resolution would need to secure a two-thirds majority, and, if it failed, doubt might be cast on the validity of the previous decision. The previous decision will stand if the Americans fail to get a two-thirds majority for the trusteeship proposal.</p>
