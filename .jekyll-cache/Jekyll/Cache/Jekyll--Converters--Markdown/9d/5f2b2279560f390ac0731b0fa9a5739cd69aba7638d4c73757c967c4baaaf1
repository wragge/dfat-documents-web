<p>Your 275 of 2nd October, German Reparations. [1]</p>

<p>The Control Council in Germany are likely in the near future to determine that certain capital industrial equipment in the Western Zones of Germany will be available for advance deliveries in accordance with paragraph 7 of the agreement on reparations reached at the Potsdam Conference. [2] It is understood that the equipment available is likely to consist mainly of plants of metal and chemical industries and of machine tools and similar equipment.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom, United States and French Governments would be glad to know whether the Commonwealth Government desire to put forward a request to receive any type of such plant or equipment or any individual plant by way of advance deliveries or otherwise and to state to which of their needs they attach the most importance and urgency. The share of any Government which does not put forward any request for advance deliveries will not be prejudiced when the time comes for allocating capital industrial equipment available for reparations in accordance with paragraph 6 of the agreement on reparations reached at the Potsdam Conference.</p>

<p>The three Governments will bear in mind all requests received but point out that they can give no assurance that it will be possible to make plant and equipment available by way of advance deliveries or otherwise.</p>

<p>Would appreciate instructions as to any requests which you desire me to put forward on behalf of Australia.</p>
