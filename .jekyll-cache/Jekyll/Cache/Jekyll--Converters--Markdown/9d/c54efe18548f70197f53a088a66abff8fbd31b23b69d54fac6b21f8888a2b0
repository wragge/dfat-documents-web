<p>MOST IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Asian Conference</p>

<p>We have suggested to Indian Government following general procedure which they have accepted in broad outlines.</p>

<p>(1). Public opening by Nehru confined to welcome and statement of objective followed by statements privately expressed of points of view of governments represented concluding with drafting of communique to Secretary-General, United Nations, which will be made known at a final public session. All should be completed within 3 days. There should be no vote; that is British Commonwealth Conference procedure. In view of [1] you might find it possible to allow Shanahan after reporting text of communique to be associated with it on same basis as everyone else.</p>

<p>In the way while Australia and New Zealand for local political reasons are represented on an official level we could nevertheless take full part from point of view of Asian countries.</p>

<p>Everything will depend on text of communique and all present indications are that it will be strictly in accord with United Nations procedure.</p>

<p>In our public statement [2] we have carefully avoided use of word observer and relied upon difference Minister and Official. This overcomes political difficulty without giving appearance of rejection of invitation to send representative of Government.</p>

<p>Regret [3] but would appreciate you discuss if possible with Shanahan before he leaves.</p>
