I"[<p>Letter LONDON, 11 May 1940</p>

<p>In this hour when you are laying down the almost unparalleled burden you have carried for the past three years I want to express to you, if I may without impertinence, my admiration for the undaunted courage and determination with which you have undeviatingly followed the course which you set yourself when you first took office.</p>

<p>Unhappily circumstances were too strong and you were prevented from achieving your objective. War apparently had to come but by your resolute personal action you gained for us a year of preparation and brought into the conflict a United British Empire.</p>

<p>For this service you are entitled to the gratitude of all British peoples.</p>

<p>With every good wish to you and Mrs. Chamberlain from us both,</p>

<p>[S. M. BRUCE]</p>
