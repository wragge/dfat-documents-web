I"‘<p>Cablegram 92 WASHINGTON, 6 [February] [1] 1941, 7.22 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 341. [2]</p>

<p>No press references to current talks [3] have been made here.</p>

<p>Talks are unknown outside the very restricted official circles.</p>

<p>On 2nd February references to the Hull-Casey talks of last year [4] appeared in the press. They originated in Wellington New Zealand on 14th January and apparently came to America by mail.</p>

<p>Reports claim that â€˜understandingâ€™ existed between the United States Australia and New Zealand in accordance with which Australia and New Zealand had agreed to grant â€˜refuelling facilities at portsâ€™ and â€˜flying fieldsâ€™ in return for some unspecified American â€˜limited guaranteeâ€™ allegedly connected with the defence of Singapore.</p>

<p>Before publication Editor â€˜New York Timesâ€™ [5] asked Hamilton of State Department and myself for confirmation and we refused to comment.</p>

<p>Burrell [6] subsequently learned that Admiral Stark [7] was very disturbed at the publication of reports.</p>

<p>Utmost secrecy regarding the present talks which are proceeding very slowly is so essential that I suggest that the Censor should continue to hold up reports which originated in New Zealand. If this should become impracticable, reports should be linked clearly with Hull-Casey conversations which occurred at the end of last year and perhaps passing reference made to Ministerâ€™s recent illness.</p>

<p>I have discussed your telegram with Butler [8] who agrees (1) utmost secrecy concerning present talks necessary. (2) Australian censor should hold up reports if possible, (3) if (2) impracticable they should definitely link with the Hull-Casey conversation of last year.</p>
