<p>Secret</p>

<p><strong>Submission No. 51â€”Australiaâ€™s Policy Towards China<a href="#f1">1</a></strong></p>

<p>Subject to a variation in wording now incorporated in sub-paragraphs 19 (iv)<a href="#f2">2</a> the Cabinet endorsed the recommendations of the Submissionâ€”</p>

<p>(a) that in examining possible tactics in the UN, the Department of Foreign Affairs be authorised to pursue with the United States, Japan and New Zealand, the consultations already opened into forms of dual representation and other possible resolutions;</p>

<p>(b) that these consultations be widened, as appropriate, to include other friendly countries in due course;</p>

<p>(c) that while participation in the drafting of resolutions tends inevitably to lead to commitment for support, we should stress that it is without commitment to the Government at this stage and should seek to avoid a vanguard role in canvassing possible resolutions or presenting them in the UN;</p>

<p>(d) that in these consultations and activities on the admission issue, and in other respects, we should seek to minimise the damage to our chances of establishing a dialogue with the PRC at some future date and on acceptable terms;</p>

<p>(e) that the question of the Australian Governmentâ€™s position should be reviewed as those of the United States, Japan and other countries become clearer.</p>

<p>2. It indicated that if the Minister were to propose any significant change or step in the course now outlined, he should have in mind that the Cabinet would need to be advised.</p>
