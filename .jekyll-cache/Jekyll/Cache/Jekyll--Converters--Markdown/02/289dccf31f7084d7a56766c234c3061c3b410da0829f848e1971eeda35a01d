I"N<p>Singapore, 6 September 1963</p>

<p>500. Secret</p>

<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>I saw Selkirk and Moore yesterday and Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. Toh)<a href="#f1">1</a> this morning. Following appears to be present position:</p>

<p>2. Singapore is threatening to declare full independence and invite selected pro-Asian countries such as the U.A.R. and Cambodia to recognise it on 16th if Constitutional demands (our 494)<a href="#f2">2</a> made on Federation are not agreed to by 12th September.</p>

<p>3. I understand the Federation will virtually meet Singapore’s demands. It will amend Tariff Board Act as requested,<a href="#f3">3</a> and will undertake to amend Constitution on question of reciprocal restriction on movement and residence. On remaining request for delegation to Singapore of powers under preservation of Public Security Ordinance in perpetuity, Federation will not write this into Constitution but is prepared to exchange letters with Lee stating that these powers will be delegated to Singapore so long as his Government remains in power and that Federation would only assume powers delegated in ‘exceptional circumstances’. (Federation considers it cannot delegate authority in perpetuity and write this into Constitution in case left wing parties come to power or there is serious deterioration in internal security situation.)</p>

<p>4. The Federation offer will be put to Lee by the British over the weekend, and if he agrees, Goh will probably visit the Federation to finalise agreement. Selkirk and Moore fear, however, that Lee may really be seeking a way to opt out of Malaysia at this stage. He has acquired taste for power and sees Singapore irrevocably losing its independence in Malaysia. Moreover, he still fears Federation will try and ‘strangle’ Singapore within the Malaysian framework. Selkirk told me in strict confidence that Sandys and the Razak had agreed to Federation and United Kingdom would ‘act together’ if Lee tried to opt out of Malaysia on 16th.<a href="#f4">4</a> This would probably mean that Lee would have to be detained and the Constitution suspended.<a href="#f5">5</a></p>

<p>5. This would be most extreme measure, and would provide ample excuse for neocolonial outcry. I find it difficult to accept that this would be done, but apparently Sandys is absolutely determined that nothing should stop the formation of Malaysia on the 16th. He may use this as final threat to Lee if he does not accept the Federation’s offer and remains intransigent next week.</p>

<p>6. Following lengthy discussion with Toh however, I find it difficult to believe that we will be confronted by this situation. I do not think Lee will try and opt out of Malaysia at this stage unless he has become quite irrational, especially as the Federation is virtually conceding his Constitutional demands. He is in habit of backing demands with threats and firmness.<a href="#f6">6</a> In circumstances, it would seem far more logical for him to go into Malaysia on 16th as scheduled and hold election as soon as possible after entry into Malaysia, after he has received merger on best possible terms, and established image as resolute leader.<a href="#f7">7</a> Elections can be held as early as 21st September, and my guess at this stage is that they will be held this month.</p>

<p>1 Dr Toh Chin Chye.</p>

<p>2 Not published. Lee had demanded further constitutional provisions relating to: (a) Singapore’s right, after the first five years of Malaysia, to withhold consent for duties recommended by the Tariff Board on condition that Singapore should compensate the federal government for any loss caused, thereby; (b) reciprocal powers of control and restriction of movement and residence; and (c) the perpetual delegation to Singapore under the Public Security Ordinance of certain powers of criminal detention.</p>

<p>3 This point had been agreed earlier in London but had not been brought out in federation legislation relating to the Joint Tariff Board due to a mistake in drafting.</p>

<p>4 Possibly: ‘Selkirk told me in strict confidence that Sandys and the Tunku had agreed that Federation and United Kingdom would ‘act together’ if Lee tried to opt out of Malaysia on 16th.’</p>

<p>5 Critchley reported on 9 September that it was ‘unlikely’ that the Federation would take such action.</p>

<p>6 Lee had intimated that unless his demands were met he would conduct an early election in Singapore in which independence would be the issue.</p>

<p>7 Writs for a post-Malaysia general election had been issued, with nominations to close on 12 September.</p>
