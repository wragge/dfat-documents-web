<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>The American Consul-General told me that he had seen Soekarno, Sjarifoeddin and senior Ministers for some hours. [1] He explained to them what good offices were along the lines set out my telegram 271. [2] He said they had completely misunderstood the position and expected the party offering good offices to be their advocate to secure appointment of an international Arbitration Commission.</p>

<p>He thought that that was how they regarded the Australian offer too.</p>

<p>I asked whether he had put a definite proposal to them and he replied that he had asked them to say whether or not they accepted the American offer as he had explained it. They promised a reply later.</p>

<p>He added that he thought that Soekarno was not well informed of the Military position.</p>
