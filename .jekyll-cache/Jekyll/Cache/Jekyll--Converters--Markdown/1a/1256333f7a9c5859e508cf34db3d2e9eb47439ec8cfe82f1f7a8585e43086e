<p>My dear P.M.,</p>

<p>The other letters that I send by this mail are as follows:-</p>

<p>LATIN AMERICA AND THE MONROE DOCTRINE Recording protests by both Argentine and Mexico at the employment of the term â€˜Monroe Doctrineâ€™ in international documents. They take the stand that it is a unilateral declaration to which they have never adhered. [1]</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-DOMINIONS OFFICE FILES I have been able to get fairly complete copies of the printed correspondence of the Dominions Office on international relations for the years 1926/7.</p>

<p>I had previously sent out the same for 1923, 1924 and 1925. They are well indexed and most useful for reference. Other Dominions do not get these files.</p>

<p>DOMINION NATIONALS Definition of a â€˜Canadianâ€™ and a â€˜South Africanâ€™, together with cases. I took this up with the Dominions Office as a matter of general interest and send the information for the files in case we are faced, in the future, with having to define ourselves.</p>

<p>DOMINION REPRESENTATION ABROAD Comments on the reported South African move of turning their Trade Commissioners into â€˜Chargeâ€™ dâ€™affairesâ€™.</p>

<p>FOREIGN OFFICE LIBRARY MEMORANDA Copies of records of Foreign Office researches into various subjects. I select the subjects from time to time from amongst the multitudinous researches of the Foreign Office Library and have them copied for our files at Canberra.</p>

<p>BRITISH CONSULAR INSTRUCTIONS I send set of complete up-to-date â€˜Instructionsâ€™ in volume form, with rules as to revision.</p>

<p>GOVERNOR GENERALâ€™S TITLE Result of my enquiring at Dominions Office as to the possible employment of the title of â€˜Viceroyâ€™ in Dominions.</p>
