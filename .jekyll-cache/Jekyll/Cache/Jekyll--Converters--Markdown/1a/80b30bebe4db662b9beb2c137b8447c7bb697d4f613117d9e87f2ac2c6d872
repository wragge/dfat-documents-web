<p>Paragraph 4 for â€˜willing and able voluntarily to accept their termsâ€™ they suggest the substitution of â€˜willing and able voluntarily to negotiate termsâ€™.</p>

<p>Paragraph [7]. It is suggested that in place of â€˜never again be allowed to build up a preponderant element of force in relation to the United Kingdom and Franceâ€™ this sentence should be altered to read â€˜never again be allowed to build up a preponderant armed force to menace the peace of European nations and of the worldâ€™.</p>
