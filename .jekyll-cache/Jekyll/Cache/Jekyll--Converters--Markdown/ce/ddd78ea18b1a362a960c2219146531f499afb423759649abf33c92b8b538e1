I"B<p>Cablegram 456 [1] CANBERRA, 20 July 1941</p>

<p>PERSONAL MOST SECRET &amp; URGENT</p>

<p>For your Prime Minister [2] from Prime Minister.</p>

<p>We regard it as of first class importance that, now that the</p>

<p>Syrian Campaign has concluded, Australian Troops in the Middle</p>

<p>East should be aggregated into one force. This would not only give</p>

<p>an opportunity for refreshment, restoration of discipline and re-</p>

<p>equipment after strenuous campaigns but would also give immense</p>

<p>satisfaction to Australian people for whom there is great national</p>

<p>value and significance in knowing that all Australian soldiers in</p>

<p>any zone form one Australian unit. This principle was fully</p>

<p>accepted by both United Kingdom Government and ours when troops</p>

<p>first despatched to Middle East.</p>

<p>Problem has a particular bearing upon the garrison at Tobruk which</p>

<p>has been engaged in continuous operations since March and is</p>

<p>therefore in the position of a force with continuous front line</p>

<p>service over a period of months, a state of affairs which must</p>

<p>result in some decline of fighting value. If they could be</p>

<p>relieved by fresh troops, movement of personnel only being</p>

<p>involved, re-aggregation and equipment of A.I.F. in Palestine</p>

<p>would then present no major difficulty.</p>

<p>I would be glad if you could direct British High Command in Middle</p>

<p>East along these lines. The comparative lull now obtaining in</p>

<p>Libya seems to make this an ideal time for making the above move,</p>

<p>to which we attach real and indeed urgent importance.</p>
