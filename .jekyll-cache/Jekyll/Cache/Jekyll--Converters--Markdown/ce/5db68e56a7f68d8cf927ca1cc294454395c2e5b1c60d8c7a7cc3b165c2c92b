I")<p>Canberra, 20 October 1972</p>

<p>13373. Confidential</p>

<p>As you know, arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the High Commission to the Minister for Foreign Affairs are now in hand here.</p>

<p>This is to confirm that I have decided the transfer should formally take place on 1 November. The immediate aim is to keep changes to a minimum so that it can take place as smoothly as possible and with the minimum disruption of normal activity.</p>

<p>I would like you to convey to the staff my appreciation of their loyal and effective service over the years and my hope and expectation that they will continue to serve Australia in just the same way when the Foreign Minister and his Department assume responsibility for the administration.</p>

<p>Under separate telegram, I am sending a message to Mr Heath confirming that the transfer will not affect the channels of direct communication between ourselves and through our respective High Commissioners. I would appreciate it if you would convey it to him personally with a copy of the proposed press announcement (follows) which will be released next week.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if you could do this in time for him to study the announcement and respond should he wish to do so.</p>

<p>You should also inform in confidential terms the State Agents General of the proposed transfer. I shall be advising the State Premiers independently.</p>

<p><strong>Press Statement to be made on 25th October 1972<br />
By the Rt. Hon. William McMahon, Prime Minister of Australia<br />
Australia House</strong></p>

<p>Arrangements are now in hand to enable transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Australian High Commission, London, to the Department of Foreign Affairs as from 1st November, 1972.</p>

<p>The decision was made some months ago. I discussed it with the British Prime Minister, Mr Heath, during my visit to London last year and the transfer was referred to by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of a statement on Australian Foreign Policy presented to the Parliament on 9th May 1972.</p>

<p>This decision to transfer responsibility for Australia House does not in any way change the special relationship which the Australian people and their successive Governments have with Britain and British Governmentsâ€”a relationship symbolised and exemplified by the link with the Crown.</p>

<p>It takes place against the background of Britainâ€™s entry into Europe. The resulting interaction between Britainâ€™s policies and those of her European partners will impose new demands for a detailed understanding by Australia in areas which are in large part the concern of the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I want to express publicly my gratitude to the Australian High Commissioner and all those employed by Australia House in London for the excellent service they have given to the Australian Government and people while Australia House has been under my administration and that of my predecessors over the past 60 years. The same devotion and quality of service will of course continue as Australia House passes under the administration of the Foreign Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>The Australian High Commissioner in London will continue to be appointed by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Foreign Minister, and the organisational arrangements being made will permit continuance of the channels of direct communication which exist between the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Australia and through their respective High Commissioners.</p>
