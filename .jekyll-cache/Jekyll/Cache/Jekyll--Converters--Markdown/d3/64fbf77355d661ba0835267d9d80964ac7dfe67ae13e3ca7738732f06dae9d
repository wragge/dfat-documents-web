<p>5313. Priority Immediate</p>

<p>Your 4588.<a href="#f1">1</a> I do not repeat not believe that document as now drafted<a href="#f2">2</a> conforms to Minister’s views on flexibility as discussed with myself and yourself. I understood that following discussions later on in the Department you yourself were of the same mind. I further do not agree that the document as it now stands can suitably be regarded as the ‘arrangements’ under section 25.<a href="#f3">3</a> It is quite impossible to settle this matter today. There is no need to do this and I remain of the opinion that it should be discussed by you and me with the Minister next week.</p>

<p>1 30 May. Following a telephone conversation of 29 May—evidently in relation to matters raised in Document 188—Warwick Smith quoted to Hay the agreement reached in the Canberra discussions of early May and noted that the Administrator had been asked for advice as to possible points of disagreement with DOET’s record (see Document 179). The Secretary continued: ‘The only point of difference of which we have a record concerns financial delegations and it does not seem practicable to operate the Ministerial Member system unless the Ministerial Member has financial delegations no less than the departmental head. As arranged by telephone I would be glad if you would let me know urgently today any points of difficulty that you see in the paper so that we may complete [the] draft and clear with you today the section 25 arrangements and submit [them] for approval this evening, before Minister leaves Canberra’ (telex B270/45SS, Warwick Smith to Hay, NAA: A452, 1970/4521 ).</p>
