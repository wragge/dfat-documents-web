<p><strong>Colombo Plan Exhibition</strong></p>

<p>When we indicated our readiness to participate (our telegram E4<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>), it was on the assumption that the exhibition would be concerned specifically with the Colombo Planâ€” the progress made with the first stage and the results to be expected from its full achievement. The purpose would be to focus attention 1n the participating countries on the magnitude of the task and the benefits which it offers. The evidence of a determined start having been made and the varied forms of aid which the participating countries, both inside and outside the area, could offer towards carrying the plan through to a successful conclusion. This would necessarily, because of the nature of many of the projects, have to rely largely on pictorial display, though, of course, there would be models and some pieces of actual equipment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We now gather from the report of our representative on the Liaison Committee, that you have in mind something larger, more diverse-and comprehensive. We fear that, in the time available, we could not organise a United Kingdom exhibit on a scale which would be adequate and appropriate to the type of exhibition you have in mind. If, therefore, there were general agreement among the participants in the Colombo Plan to join a wider exhibition of this nature, we would feel bound to review the question of our participation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the present we are continuing to think in terms of a United Kingdom display centring on a contribution we can make in the form of Technical Assistance and the supply of equipment to the Colombo Plan. As already indicated, it would be largely in the form of a pictorial and graphic display with some models and a certain amount of actual equipment centring on the three themes of provision of capital goods and technical services, scientific resources and social services. In view of the timing and length of the exhibition we would not expect any general participation by United Kingdom industry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that you do not consider it necessary to obtain the consent of the International Exhibitions Bureau and also that Ceylon is not a signatory to the International Convention. You will appreciate, however, that we, as signatories, would have to satisfy ourselves that the Bureau did not regard the Exhibition as coming within its scope before we agreed finally to participate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would agree with your view that, without full and effective participation by all the Commonwealth countries co-operating in the Colombo Plan, the Exhibition would do more harm than good. We note contents of New Zealand telegram 22<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> to you and we hope that other Commonwealth Governments will express a view as soon as possible so that an early decision may be reached as to whether the project is going forward.</p>
  </li>
