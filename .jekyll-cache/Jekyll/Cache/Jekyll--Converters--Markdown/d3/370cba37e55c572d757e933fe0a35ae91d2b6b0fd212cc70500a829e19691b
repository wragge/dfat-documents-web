<p>Telegram dated 17th October from Administration broadcasting station Rabaul reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜At public meetings held near Rabaul last night one hundred New Guineans mainly Tolais unanimously elected Vin Tobaining as President of new political party.

</blockquote>

<p>ABC midday radio report said two reasons given for formation of partyâ€”first, Moresby was too remote from the islands and the people there felt out on a limb, secondly, the islands people felt they had no real affinity with New Guinea mainland people from whom they regarded themselves as different.<a href="#f4">4</a></p>

<p>4  The AEC issued a statement on the same day: â€˜The AEC â€¦ called upon Papuans and New Guineans in all districts to work together for the unity of the Territory. Members of the Council feel that National Unity is essential if the Territory is to make the progress which all people everywhere want. Each district is heavily dependent on all the others for its future. Each district benefits from the national institutions built in many different districts â€¦ Each district has much to gain from uniting in a common effort to make the Territory into a viable, self-reliant country with sufficient numbers to support a modem economy. The Council recalls the statement of the Governor General, Lord Casey, when opening the House of Assembly on 4th June, 1968, who said that Members of the House â€¦ had an important responsibility in bringing about national unity. The Council concluded that the House of Assembly should be asked to discuss the question of national unity at its meeting in Novemberâ€™ (telex 8427, Hay to Warwick Smith, NAA: A452, 1968/5430). Following an oral briefing, Barnes â€˜wondered whether, in view of some of the statements made at the Rabaul meeting, an expatriate might not be involvedâ€™. Besley told him that â€˜it seemed to be largely a Tolai matterâ€™, adding that Kapena (MHA, Hiri open electorate) had told Warwick Smith that the formation of the MIF was â€˜largely a political move on Tobainingâ€™s part possibly as a means of outâ€“flanking Oscar Tammur with whom he was at variance over the land squatting issueâ€™ (minute, Besley to Warwick Smith, 18 October 1968, NAA: A452, 1968/5429).</p>
