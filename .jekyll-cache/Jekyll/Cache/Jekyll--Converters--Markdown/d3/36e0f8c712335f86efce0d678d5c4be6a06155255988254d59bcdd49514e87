I"ß<p>Cablegram unnumbered 27 April 1941,</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>In a press statement issued today, Mr. Curtin, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the A.L.P., emphasised that there was no political disunity in Australia about the prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Australians face it as a united and determined people: although criticism and expression of opinion are free here this should not be mistaken as any evidence of doubt.</p>

<p>It was reprehensible that political controversy had been capitalised by the enemy to the detriment of our cause. â€˜There never has been nor should there be,â€™ said Mr. Curtin, â€˜any doubt about Australia. As Leader of the A.L.P., I say to our enemies that the workers of this country are determined to give their all in the war that has been forced upon us. To the United States I say that the Labour Movement of Australia will be unflinching and unyielding to the end for we have a common interest and a common fate in resisting any aggression. Finally, I say to all the world, friends or foes, there is no political disunity in Australia in regard to the prosecution of the war.â€™ [1]</p>
