<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In view of possibility of Allied Governments having to consider proposals involving extension of war measures, especially in regard to economic warfare, we would ask to be informed immediately of important issues affecting the Pacific and the Far East, especially action likely to be regarded by Japan as provocative or discriminatory.</p>

<p>You will appreciate our anxiety to maintain stability in this region, and we would like to be consulted beforehand on any such proposal, in order to be given an opportunity of submitting our views before a final decision is reached.</p>
