<p>Supply of Arms and Warlike Stores to Overseas Countries</p>

<p>With reference to your Top Secret memorandum 3323 asking for a direction regarding an enquiry from the British Service Mission to Burma about certain types of anti-tank gun and mortar ammunition required by the Burmese Government, it is not considered that any departure from recognised Government policy should be made in this case. It is accordingly suggested that the British Service Mission should be informed that the ammunition asked for is not available for disposal to the Burmese Government.</p>
