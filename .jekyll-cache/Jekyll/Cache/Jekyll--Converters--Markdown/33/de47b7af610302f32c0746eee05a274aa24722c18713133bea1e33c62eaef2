<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER URGENT</p>

<p>ANZAC DAY. General Freyburg [1] has sent a friendly message to Marshal Chakmak Chief of the Turkish General Staff at Ankara who has replied. These messages will be published in both Turkish and New Zealand orders of the day on 25th April and read out to the troops. Turkish Embassy here are very gratified by the message and have intimated that they would be glad to carry out the same procedure with Australians.
