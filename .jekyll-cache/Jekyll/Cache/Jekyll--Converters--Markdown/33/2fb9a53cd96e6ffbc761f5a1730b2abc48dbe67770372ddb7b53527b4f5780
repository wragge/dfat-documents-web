<hr />

<p>Chinese Representation</p>

<p>Our assessment of voting on the two resolutions we are coâ€“sponsoring indicates that the final result will be close. For your own information only, our count on the IQ resolution as at 30th September 1971 was 55 (in favour)â€“57 (against)â€“17 (abstentions) with Maldives absent. The count on the DR was 48â€“64â€“17. (Seven states which support only the ROC currently propose to vote for the IQ and oppose the DR).</p>

<p>2. Many posts have already lobbied for support for our resolutions. It has now been decided that, in conjunction with the United States, Japan and New Zealand, we will concentrate on the following five tasks between now and the time the vote is taken (possibly at the end of October):</p>

<p>(a) ensure that a majority will vote to give priority consideration to the IQ over the AR, persuading even countries which will not vote for the IQ itself to accord this necessary priority,</p>

<p>(b) ensure that we hold together the countries now decided or leaning in favour of our resolutions,</p>

<p>(c) persuade as many of the uncommitted as possible to vote for our resolutions,</p>

<p>(d) persuade countries decided or leaning against our resolutions to abstain,</p>

<p>(e) persuade the right wing states who are decided or leaning against the DR that a vote for the DR is the only way to preserve a place for the ROC in the UN.</p>
