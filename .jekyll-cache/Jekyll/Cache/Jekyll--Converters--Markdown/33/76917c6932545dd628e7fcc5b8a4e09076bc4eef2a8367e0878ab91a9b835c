<p>1 Chifley left Sydney by air on 14 December for a holiday in New Zealand. Evatt served as Acting Prime Minister until Chifley returned to Australia on 1 January 1948.</p>

<p>2 Officer replied on 17 December that Van Boetzelaer agreed that it would be most desirable for Beel to visit Australia, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs feared that an urgent need for the Prime Ministerâ€™s early return to Holland could preclude such a visit.</p>
