<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>Your telegram of 14th April. [2] In my long conversation with the Prime Minister-my telegram NO. 207 of 27th March [3]-I stressed the necessity for more resolute and imaginative diplomacy and propaganda both in Scandinavia and South-East Europe and brought out all points in my telegram No. 205 of 27th March. [4] As I indicated in my telegram No. 207 at first the Prime Minister was resentful of criticism but subsequently fully discussed in friendly atmosphere various points I had raised and I believe that the Prime Minister appreciated without admitting it that there was some justification for criticism.</p>

<p>I feel that this leaven which was provided unofficially is working and we may hope for results.</p>

<p>If, however, I now convey your message officially which covered the same points raised by me in my conversation I fear it will create considerable resentment resulting in a long cable of justification of the United Kingdom Government policy past and present and put the Prime Minister on the defensive.</p>

<p>For these reasons and in view of immediate vital questions that now face the Prime Minister-my telegram No. 244 [5]-I feel that the present moment is not opportune for the communication of your message and I would earnestly plead that you permit me to withhold delivery of it. [6]</p>
