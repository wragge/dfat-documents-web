<p>14. Immediate</p>

<p><em>1. Atomic Energy</em></p>

<p>We are concerned about press reports on atomic bomb experiments in the Pacific area.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>As Atomic Commission<a href="#f2">2</a> has now been constituted please endeavour to ascertain from the United States authorities precisely what is proposed in relation to experiments. Such experiments should only be made with the full knowledge of the Commission under whose jurisdiction the matter of atomic energy has been placed. Please ascertain from experts, such as Professor Oliphant,<a href="#f3">3</a> the possibilities of the experiment, and in particular, whether there is any risk of injury from destruction having regard to MacArthur’s<a href="#f4">4</a> statement published here today that the bomb to be tested is one thousand times more powerful than the bomb used against Japan.</p>

<p>The area proposed for experiment is one in which we are interested. Military, naval and scientific experts should be brought into the matter and informed of the arrangements.</p>

<p>Apart from this experiment a place should be found for Australia’s staff experts in connection with the Security Council’s military staff work. This is contemplated by the Charter. We will have a very direct interest in this matter during the two years of Australia’s membership.<a href="#f5">5</a></p>

  <li>1 The Operation Crossroads tests at Bikini Atoll. Two shots, Able and Baker, would be tested in July 1946.</li>
  <li>2 The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, established on 24 January 1946 by resolution 1 of the UN General Assembly ‘to deal with the problems raised by the discovery of atomic energy’.</li>
  <li>3 Mark Oliphant, Australian-born Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham, had been a member of the UK atomic program and later joined the Manhattan Project. Oliphant was enlisted by Chifley to advise on a possible Australian atomic energy program in early 1946. On 13 November 1943 the Defence Committee invited Oliphant to chair the Atomic Developments Sub-Committee. See note by Frederick Shedden, Secretary, Department of Defence, 25 June 1948, NAA: A5954, 1385/3. Stewart Cockburn and David Ellyard, <em>Oliphant: The Life and Times of Sir Mark Oliphant</em> , Axiom Books, Adelaide, 1981.</li>
  <li>4 General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur was then the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.</li>
  <li>5 Australia had been successful in securing representation on both the Security Council as a non-permanent member on 12 January 1946 for the years 1946 and 1947 and the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Relevant documents are located in NAA: A1838, 720/1 and US National Archives and Records Administration: RG84, Box 68, ‘Mission to UN: Atomic Energy’.</li>
