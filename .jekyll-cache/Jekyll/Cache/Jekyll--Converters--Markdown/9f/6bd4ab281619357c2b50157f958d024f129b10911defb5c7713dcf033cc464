<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Allied Council for Japan.</p>

<p>Macmahon Ball has asked for instructions on the following points.</p>

<p>[1]</p>

<p>(a) I assume that Council Members should individually or collectively seek not merely to review, but to initiate, proposals if they feel such proposals are necessary to carry out effectively F.E.C. directives.</p>

<p>(b) I assume that I should do whatever possible to reconcile American and Russian points of view, in particular, that I should openly support those declarations of democratic principles which the Russian Member seems anxious to make while showing caution in committing myself to support his specific requests to S.C.A.P.</p>

<p>(c) The question of appointing three Deputy Secretaries-General will arise at the next meeting. Should I support Russia in the opinion that a Deputy Secretary-General should be appointed from each of the Three Powers to work under the American Secretary- General, though my own view is that such appointments would tend to create unnecessary administrative complications? I think that we can rely on present service personnel for satisfactory secretarial service.</p>

<p>2. Subject to your comments we propose this reply.</p>

<p>(a) We consider it is your province to initiate such proposals after consultation with your Committee of Advisers. Where differences occur you should request instructions.</p>

<p>(b) We concur.</p>

<p>(c) If you think present service personnel can give satisfactory objective service without internationalising secretariat then three suggested Secretaries-General seem superfluous. Ends.</p>
