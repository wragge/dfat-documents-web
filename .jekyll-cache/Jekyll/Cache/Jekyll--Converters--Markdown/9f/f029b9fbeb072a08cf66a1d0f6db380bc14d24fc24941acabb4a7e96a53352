<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Committeeâ€™s reports on Trade Restrictions [1] and on postponement of negotiations [2] will give the Republic as good an opportunity as it is likely to have of taking a firm line in the Security Council and dramatising the present situation.</p>

<p>Many Republicans now regard prospect of peaceful solution as most unlikely and the Republic may therefore endeavour to submit Australian/U.S. proposals [3] to the Security Council. It seems clear that only some intervention by the Council can prevent a further serious deterioration in the situation.</p>
