I"<p>Cablegram Hague [1] 12 THE HAGUE, 22 January 1948, 5.35 p.m.</p>

<p>My telegram No. 11.</p>

<p>Following is statement. Begins:-</p>

<p>The Netherlands Government have accepted 6 points proposed by Committee Good Offices fully and unconditionally as a basis for political discussions for Republic.</p>

<p>It now appears Republic for its part, has attached one sided interpretation as a condition for its acceptance.</p>

<p>The Netherlands Government who have requested clarification, are of the opinion that they are entitled to expect Republic to accept 6 points without restriction -as they were proposed by Committee of Good Offices-before they can proceed with discussion on basis of these points.</p>

<p>Only in this manner is it possible to avoid that misunderstanding arise regarding obligation of both parties. Ends.</p>

<p>1 Variously prefixed ‘Hague’ or ‘Hag’, cablegrams from the Australian Legation in The Hague formed a single series.</p>
