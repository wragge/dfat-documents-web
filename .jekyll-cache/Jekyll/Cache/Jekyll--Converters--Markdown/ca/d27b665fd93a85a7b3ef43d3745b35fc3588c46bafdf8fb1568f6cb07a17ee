<p><em>Disarmament</em></p>

<p>Telegram 290<a href="#f1">1</a> to you from Washington states that Rusk will provide the Prime Minister with a list of countries which, while pressing strongly for disarmament, were continually seeking themselves to purchase arms abroad.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>The following comment is offered without knowing the background of Rusk’s offer and hence which of several possible arguments the figures are intended to demonstrate.</li>
  <li>The fact that a country is simultaneously pressing for disarmament and seeking arms is not by itself evidence of hypocrisy or double standard. A government might genuinely want world disarmament and at the same time realize that it cannot itself become disarmed unless there is a world disarmament system with adequate measures for inspection enforcement and control.</li>
  <li>See my talk with R.K. Nehru (formerly Secretary-General of Indian Ministry for External Affairs) on 26th March, 1964 (copy dated 31st March was sent to External Affairs Officer London from New Delhi).<a href="#f3">3</a> In para. 14 Nehru and I discussed the problems of countries like Australia and India which in the past had kept their defence expenditure to a minimum and had threatened no-one, but which were now obliged to rearm and which, therefore, could not accept disarmament proposals calling for a uniform percentage cut in defence expenditure as assessed at some unacceptable date.</li>
