I"î<p>Cablegram 497 LONDON, 6 July 1942, 11.35 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>In order that British-Japanese exchange can take place at Lourenco</p>

<p>Marques on 20th August 1942, as agreed, we have to embark Japanese</p>

<p>personnel on 13th July. But this depends on the conclusion of</p>

<p>negotiations with the Japanese. Only outstanding points are</p>

<p>release of certain prisoners and release of Bowden and Ross. As</p>

<p>only seven days remain it is now extremely urgent to clear these</p>

<p>points up.</p>

<p>2. It appears from my telegram No. 488 of 2nd July [1] that</p>

<p>Japanese are not in fact in a position to surrender Bowden and</p>

<p>there is reason for thinking that Ross may now not be in Japanese</p>

<p>hands. [2] The Japanese reply to the reminder which we sent on 2nd</p>

<p>July may therefore be that they are not in a position to surrender</p>

<p>him either.</p>

<p>3. We strongly sympathise with your desire and understand your</p>

<p>obligation to recover both Bowden and Ross if at all possible and</p>

<p>have, as you know, backed your request with the Japanese by</p>

<p>offering a substantial concession. [3] But if, as now appears very</p>

<p>likely, it proves impossible for the Japanese to do what you ask,</p>

<p>we should be glad to know whether you will agree to allow the</p>

<p>whole exchange to take place as planned.</p>

<p>4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fears that to</p>

<p>endeavour to arrange that exchange shall take place with the</p>

<p>exclusion of eight official and unknown number of unofficial</p>

<p>Australians and twenty-five official and thirty-one unofficial</p>

<p>Japanese originating in Australia may well wreck the whole</p>

<p>exchange scheme. This would mean that the repatriation of 1800</p>

<p>British and Allied nationals from the Far East would be prevented.</p>

<p>You will appreciate the difficulty with which we should be faced</p>

<p>in relation to our own public opinion and the Allied Governments</p>

<p>if the exchange broke down on such grounds, having regard to the</p>

<p>doubt as to whether the Japanese are in a position to produce</p>

<p>either or both of these men.</p>

<p>5. In all circumstances we very much hope that, if the Japanese</p>

<p>answer regarding Ross is as we fear, you will agree to proceed</p>

<p>with the exchange scheme as a whole and would be most grateful for</p>

<p>earliest possible indication of your views.</p>

<p>1 On file AA: A981, Consuls 13, ii. It conveyed a message from the</p>

<p>Japanese Govt stating that V. G. Bowden (formerly Official</p>

<p>Representative in Singapore) had left Singapore for the</p>

<p>Netherlands East Indies at about the end of January and that his</p>

<p>present whereabouts were unknown. Bowden had, in fact, left</p>

<p>Singapore on 14 February with a group of refugees, but three days</p>

<p>later had been captured and executed by Japanese troops on Banka</p>

<p>Island. News of his death was not received in Australia until the</p>

<p>end of the war. See also Documents an Australian Foreign Policy</p>

<p>1937-49, vol. V, Document 333.</p>

<p>2 David Ross, formerly Consul in Dili, had been released from</p>

<p>captivity by the Japanese in June to convey a message demanding</p>

<p>the surrender of Australian forces still fighting in Portuguese</p>

<p>Timor. The troops had refused to surrender and Ross had</p>

<p>subsequently been evacuated to Australia. See also ibid.,</p>

<p>Documents 528 and 533.</p>

<p>3 That if Bowden and Ross were released the U.K. Govt would permit</p>

<p>one or two Japanese officials en route to Japanese missions in</p>

<p>Europe to travel on the evacuation ships. See ibid., Document 516.</p>
