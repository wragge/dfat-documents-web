<p>Cablegram 467 [1] CANBERRA, 23 July 1941</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your M.172. [2]</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government is fully in accord with conclusions set</p>

<p>out in paragraph 4 of your telegram under reference. [3] As you</p>

<p>are aware, we have always attached highest importance to gaining</p>

<p>assurance of collaboration of United States in course of action in</p>

<p>restraint of Japan. Now that the United States Government has</p>

<p>decided to adopt severe measures in event of Japanese move in</p>

<p>Indo-China, we feel strongly that whole object of our policy in</p>

<p>Far East over past year would be negatived if British Empire now</p>

<p>lagged behind United States in effectiveness or determination of</p>

<p>its own counter measures, and same consideration would apply to</p>

<p>any attempt at this stage to dissuade United States from</p>

<p>proceeding to contemplated lengths. We emphasise, however, need in</p>

<p>our opinion for utmost frankness in present exchanges with United</p>

<p>States Government in sense of paragraph 4 (3) in order that there</p>

<p>can be no possibility of misunderstanding. [4]</p>

<p>1 Repeated to the Canadian and South African Prime Ministers and</p>

<p>to the N.Z. Acting Prime Minister as nos 4, 52 and 272; and to the</p>

<p>Ministers to the United States and Japan as nos 75 and 4.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 22 July. On file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i.</p>

<p>3 This paragraph stressed the U.K. Govt’s belief that it was</p>

<p>important to co-operate in measures which the United States</p>

<p>proposed to take against Japan if it occupied Indo-Chinese bases.</p>

<p>4 Paragraph 4(3) read: ‘That if we are called upon to go to</p>

<p>lengths which involve plain risk of war with Japan, every effort</p>

<p>should be made to obtain the clearest possible indication from</p>

<p>United States that we can count without reservation on their</p>

<p>active armed Support.’</p>
