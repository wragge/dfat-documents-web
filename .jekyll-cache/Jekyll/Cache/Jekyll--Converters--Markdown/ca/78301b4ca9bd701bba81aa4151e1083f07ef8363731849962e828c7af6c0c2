I"/<p>Letter [CANBERRA], 10 January 1944</p>

<p>Relative to the proposed Agreement between Canada and Australia in</p>

<p>connection with the furnishing of Mutual Aid by Canada to</p>

<p>Australia, under our Mutual Aid policy, I was instructed on</p>

<p>January 6th to deliver a message to you from my Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I found upon inquiry that you were in Western Australia and would</p>

<p>not return until the 17th and that therefore it would be</p>

<p>impossible for me to deliver this message to you personally before</p>

<p>that date. I communicated this information to Ottawa and have now</p>

<p>been instructed to deliver the message to you immediately. The</p>

<p>message from the Prime Minister of Canada to you is as follows:</p>

<p>‘Your High Commissioner in Ottawa has informed me that the</p>

<p>Australian Cabinet is unable to accept the proposed Article X of</p>

<p>the Mutual Aid Agreement between our two countries. [1] I greatly</p>

<p>regret this decision and hope you will find it possible to</p>

<p>reconsider the position. We have considered the suggestion, that</p>

<p>there might be substituted for this Article, a reference in the</p>

<p>preamble to the effect that Australia and Canada have accepted in</p>

<p>principle the general objectives set forth in the Atlantic Charter</p>

<p>and in Article VII of the master Lend-Lease Agreement. We feel</p>

<p>however, that we cannot agree to this alternative, as the question</p>

<p>appears to us of greater importance than would be implied by a</p>

<p>mere general reference of this character.</p>

<p>It seems to us logical and indeed essential that the Mutual Aid</p>

<p>Agreements should contain a re-affirmation of the main points of</p>

<p>general international economic policy which we are all pledged to</p>

<p>pursue after the war by our acceptance of the Atlantic Charter and</p>

<p>by the formal undertakings into which we have entered with the</p>

<p>Government of the United States. Our Mutual Aid policy and Act</p>

<p>were deliberately formulated to fit into post-war economic inter</p>

<p>national relations of this character and to make them more</p>

<p>workable by eliminating the accumulation of large war debts among</p>

<p>the United Nations. The Canadian Parliament and people have</p>

<p>accepted the heavy financial burden of Mutual Aid with this</p>

<p>expectation in view.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that we believe it is essential that all our</p>

<p>Mutual Aid Agreements should contain an assurance that the nations</p>

<p>receiving this assistance also look forward to international</p>

<p>economic relations of this character. We had naturally believed</p>

<p>that Australia and the other countries participating in Mutual Aid</p>

<p>subscribed to the principles in question because they had so</p>

<p>declared in their agreements with the United States. [2] If under</p>

<p>these circumstances the Government of Australia should not find it</p>

<p>possible to reconsider their decision not to re-affirm their</p>

<p>support of these principles we would be obliged to consider that</p>

<p>the Government of Australia is out of sympathy with the general</p>

<p>philosophy behind the Mutual Aid policy and therefore that its</p>

<p>requirements from Canada would have to be obtained on some other</p>

<p>basis.</p>

<p>We have, of course, no desire or intention that the flow of</p>

<p>essential war supplies to Australia from Canada should be</p>

<p>interrupted. If, however, your Government is not ready to sign the</p>

<p>agreement, we consider we must make new arrangements for the</p>

<p>financing of these supplies. The only alternative appears to be</p>

<p>that we should provide essential supplies under a credit to be</p>

<p>repaid within an appropriate period after the war.</p>

<p>Under any such arrangement it would be necessary, as you will</p>

<p>realize, to make a public explanation of the reasons which have</p>

<p>prevented us from fulfilling our intention of providing essential</p>

<p>supplies to Australia out of the Mutual Aid vote without cost to</p>

<p>the Australian Government.’</p>
