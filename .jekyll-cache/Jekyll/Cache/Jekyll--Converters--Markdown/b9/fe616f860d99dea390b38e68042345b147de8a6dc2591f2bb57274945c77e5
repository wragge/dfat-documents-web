<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Moscow telegram No. 70 repeated to you as No. 25. [2]</p>

<p>Despite the interpretation of the Legation, the procedure as outlined by Zorin [3] for the future presentation of requests for exit permits may be based upon administrative convenience and, in the Governmentâ€™s view, must be accepted on this basis until the contrary is definitely proved in practice.</p>

<p>2. You should therefore communicate a solely objective account of the Soviet Governmentâ€™s action to the Polish Government, adding that in the view of the Australian Government the procedure proposed should be accepted at its face value and applications for exit permits made individually to the local authorities in future as suggested. If in fact this leads to delays beyond that experienced under the previous procedure or to a refusal of the Soviet authorities to grant such permits the Australian Government would be ready to re-open the whole question with the Soviet Government. In case the Polish Government reacts unfavourably to the proposal, it should be advised that it would be most unwise to make any public statement or register a protest at this stage. The position in such a case would, in the opinion of the</p>

<p>Australian Government, become impossible and it is imperative that the new procedure be given a reasonable trial.</p>

<p>3. Please inform the United Kingdom Government of the contents of telegram 70 and of our views as set out above.</p>
