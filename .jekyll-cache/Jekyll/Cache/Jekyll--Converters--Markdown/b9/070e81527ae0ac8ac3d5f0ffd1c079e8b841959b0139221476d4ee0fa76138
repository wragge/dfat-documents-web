<p>894. Secret Immediate</p>

<p>Please convey following message from Barwick.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>Begins:</p>

<p>1. â€˜I have been closely following the course of events since the Manila summit and I am greatly disappointed that its results are being brought into jeopardy by insistence on a number of observers. It appeared to me that the central and decisive circumstance was that U Thant as a trusted official of the United Nations should have an opportunity of reporting on the wishes of the people of Sarawak and Sabah vis-a-vis Malaysia. The presence of observers seemed to me peripheral and lack of unanimity as to their number not a critical matter. Indeed, the express terms of clause 7 have been fulfilled,<a href="#f2">2</a> the British Government being in no sense a party to the accords. It would trouble me if, as is likely, Indonesiaâ€™s course caused Australia and also many other countries to doubt Indonesiaâ€™s intention to carry out the Manila accords and lent colour to the belief held by many Australians that Indonesia has ambitions of the kind you have constantly assured me are not entertained.</p>

<p>2. I have already told you of Australiaâ€™s interest and place in the security of this region and emphasised the importance which we attach to the creation and support of Malaysia in relation to that securityâ€”a security against our common enemy in China.</p>

<p>3. I am sure you have realised that in that connection we deem the continuance of British presence vital, certainly in the foreseeable future. This circumstance alone will ensure that any Australian Government must support the retention of the bases under the British Malayan Defence arrangements and the continued military commitment of the British. Our long tradition of military co-operation with Great Britain must re-inforce the compelling nature of the security needs of the region. I feel this must be said lest some misunderstanding should exist as to Australiaâ€™s interest and position.</p>

<p>4. I was glad to receive your letter sent through Suadi and to learn that you will come to see us later this year. I am glad to learn of your recovery.â€™<a href="#f3">3</a></p>

<p>Ends.</p>

<p>1  To Subandrio.</p>

<p>2  Clause 7 of the Joint Statement stated: â€˜In the interest of the countries concerned, the three Heads of Government deem it desirable to send observers to witness the carrying out of the task to be undertaken by the working teams, and the Federation of Malaya will use its best endeavours to obtain the cooperation of the British Government and the Governments of Sabah (North Borneo) and Sarawak in furtherance of this purposeâ€™.</p>

<p>3  In his letter, dated 14 August, Subandrio had written that he was considering a visit to Australia when returning from the UN General Assembly later that year. At the time of writing, Subandrio was recovering from influenza which he had contracted after returning from the Manila summit.</p>
