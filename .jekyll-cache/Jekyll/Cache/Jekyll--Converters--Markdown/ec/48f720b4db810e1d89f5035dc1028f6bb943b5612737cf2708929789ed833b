I"ó<p>Cablegram unnumbered 12 January 1940,</p>

<p>URGENT AND MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In view of the importance and possible repercussions of any</p>

<p>decision to take action in Norwegian territorial waters to cut off</p>

<p>German supplies of iron ore I earnestly request that no decision</p>

<p>should be taken by the United Kingdom Cabinet until the Dominions</p>

<p>have had an opportunity to express their views.</p>

<p>To enable these views to be formed I suggest that we should be</p>

<p>fully informed of the arguments in favour of and against the</p>

<p>proposed action and that we should be supplied with a summary of</p>

<p>any appreciation by the General Staff of the assistance that could</p>

<p>be rendered to Norway and Sweden in the event of the proposed</p>

<p>action leading to an attack by Germany on one or both of these</p>

<p>countries.</p>

<p>While I realise the significance of the iron ore export to Germany</p>

<p>my present disposition is to think that the suggested action would</p>

<p>have a bad effect in neutral countries and might present arguments</p>

<p>to Germany which she would not otherwise have. [1]</p>
