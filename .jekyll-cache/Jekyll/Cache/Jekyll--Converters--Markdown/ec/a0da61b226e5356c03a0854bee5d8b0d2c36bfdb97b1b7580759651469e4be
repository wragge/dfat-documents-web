<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Indonesia I went today accompanied by Minister to State Department to see Associate Under Secretary Armour who had with him Lacy, N.E.I.</p>

<p>expert, and Richards. I developed at length the views set out in your telegram number 80. [1] Lacy said that U.S. advices were that there were very few exportable products from Republican area.</p>

<p>Sugar was only product in large quantities and this had been held up for so long-through no oneâ€™s fault-it had now deteriorated. I replied that if this was the case it would be easier for the Dutch to be accommodating.</p>

<p>Armour said that it was their view that Committee should remain in Indonesia-if not Graham himself then someone else.</p>

<p>As regards exports this would require some study and he would undertake it at once.</p>

<p>I understand from a member of my staff that Lacy and others in State Department take view that Dutch have been reasonable in their attitude to recent negotiations whatever they were in the past.</p>

<p>Armour, as always, was extremely cordial and said he would communicate with me again.</p>
