<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>My immediately preceding telegram. [1]</p>

<p>Following is text of letter to Ballard signed this morning:</p>

<p>BEGINS:</p>

<p>BATAVIA, Djakarta.</p>

<p>24th May.</p>

<p>Sir, With reference to conversations you have recently had on the subject with the competent Netherlands Indies and Republican authorities the under-signed have the honour to inform you that the Netherlands Indies Government and Government of the Republic of Indonesia would appreciate the good offices of the Australian Government to secure the immediate lifting of the shipping ban.</p>

<p>Both Governments call to the fact that such a measure would be in the interests of the whole of Indonesia, as the goods at present in Australia, which cannot be moved as a result of the said ban, will also help to meet the needs of the Republic on the basis of an arrangement to be concluded between the Netherlands Indies Government and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. [2]</p>

<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Sir, the assurance of my high consideration.</p>

<p>(Signed) H. J. van Mook, Lieutenant Governor-General of the Netherlands Indies</p>

<p>(Signed) Sjahrir, Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia</p>

<p>Mr. B. C. Ballard, Consul-General of Australia, Pegangsaan West 14th, BATAVIA.</p>
