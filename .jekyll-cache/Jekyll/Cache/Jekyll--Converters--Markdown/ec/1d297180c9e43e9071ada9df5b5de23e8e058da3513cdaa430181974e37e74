<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Your 60. [1] Document S.1235 [2] circulated this morning contains report of first meeting of the new commission in Batavia on 29th January. Critchley will no doubt have reported negative Dutch attitude to commissionâ€™s initial approach.</p>

<p>Unless he is held up by the weather Cochran [3] will leave Washington for Batavia today after consultations with Jessup who has gone to Washington for the purpose.</p>

<p>The initiative appears now to rest squarely on the commission whose worth will determine the success or otherwise of the Councilâ€™s resolution. [4] The United States shares this view although diplomatic pressure on the Dutch, possibly in relation to Marshall Aid, is not ruled out here. It may be for this reason that although the United States expects Dutch obstruction to the Commissionâ€™s work they do not appear to be unduly disturbed.</p>
