<p>German memorandum of Dominions Office telegram Number 265 [2] great advance on Hider’s letter, Dominions Office telegram Number 259 [3], in tone and substance particularly by inclusion of date 1st. October. Pending information from Prime Minister [4] and examination no conclusion can be formed but atmosphere for the moment distinctly more hopeful.</p>
