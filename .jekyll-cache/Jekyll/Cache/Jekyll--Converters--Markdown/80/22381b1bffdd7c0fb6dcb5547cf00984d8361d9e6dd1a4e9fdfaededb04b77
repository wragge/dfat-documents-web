<hr />

<p>Australia House</p>

<p>I told the Prime Minister of my discussion with Mr Bowen. <a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>2. He noted that we had had a discussion rather than a negotiation and that Mr Bowen had, for the most part, spoken philosophically—though of course with firmness of view.</p>

<p>3. He said he would await developments.</p>

<p>4. The Prime Minister referred again to the proposal that there be a Deputy High Commissioner appointed under the Public Service Act. He said he would not accept this. He did not want it to be a place for ‘rejected Permanent Heads’. I said this never was the notion. The word ‘rejected’ was wrong. Look at the past: McCarthy, Brown, Knott and Boswell.</p>

<p>5. He said, ‘Even so, we can’t have it under the Public Service Act.’</p>

<p>6. I said I believed it was a wise and proper proposal, given the nature of the job to be done in London and the wide reputation in Australia House of Australian Departments.</p>

<p>7. He then asked me about Mr Bowen’s attitude on the High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner reporting to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>8. I said Mr Bowen was relaxed about the appointment of the High Commissioner by the Prime Minister and/or the Cabinet, but once appointed, he wanted the High Commissioner to report to him.</p>

<p>9. The Prime Minister said this would not be so. It was no use Mr Bowen trying to insist.</p>
