<h2 id="timor-special-representative-of-the-secretary-general">Timor: Special Representative of the Secretary General</h2>

<p>Akosah (Foreign Ministry) told us today that the tentative program for Wmspeareâ€™s visit included calls on the President, Malik and round table talks with officials. Winspeare has apparently agreed to use the Pelita aircraft.<a href="#f1">1</a> He will not be accompanied by Indonesian officials.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Kupang Winspeare will have talks with a representative of the provisional government in Dili about his program in East Timor. Akosah said that the Foreign Ministryâ€™s responsibility for the visit ended in Kupang. After Kupang he would be in the hands of the provisional government.</li>

<ol>
  <li>In addition to pursuing the charade about their involvement in East Timor the Indonesians seem to hope that Winspeareâ€™s visit can be used to add credibility to the provisional government.</li>

<ul>
  <li>1 Cablegram JA4085 (9 January) reported information from Akosah that an aircraft from Pelita (Pertaminaâ€™s airline) was being made ready for charter by Winspeare Guicciardi. A foreign aircraft, either from Singapore or Australia, would be unacceptable to the Indonesian Government.</li>
