I"Þ<p>Cablegram 909 WASHINGTON, 11 July 1947, 5.57 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Japanese Settlement.</p>

<p>1. This morning, Friday, I received a telephone communication from the State Department to the effect that they were inviting the 10 other countriesâ€™ members of F.E.C. to send representatives to a meeting in General Hilldringâ€™s office late this afternoon. They added that the subject of the meeting would be one pertaining to proposed Japanese Treaty.</p>

<p>2. At the meeting which Minister attended, Hilldring read a statement, full text of which and also comment follow in my two immediately following telegrams.</p>

<p>3. Statement sets out United States desire to hold as soon as practicable, a conference of representatives from the II Statesâ€™ members of F.E.C. to discuss a peace treaty for Japan but such conference to be outside F.E.C. It suggests as a tentative date 19th August, 1947, for convening an initial peace conference (of deputies and experts) in or near Washington or at San Francisco.</p>

<p>It asks for early expression of views.</p>

<p>4. Text is still secret. Hilldring said they did not propose to publish before tomorrow, Saturday, night at earliest, unless there were a leakage. He added they would much prefer to wait several days or even a week before publication until views of other countries were received, but doubted whether it could go that far without leakage.</p>
