<p>37. Secret</p>

<p>I have had most difficult meetings with Australian Ministers on Monday about the communique, although up till then discussions though forthright were friendly and constructive.</p>

<p>2. They are determined to include passages which</p>

<ol>
  <li>indicate their belief that British membership of EEC would inevitably weaken political ties of Commonwealth,</li>
  <li>state that whether we negotiate or not is our business and that they therefore have no right to object, implying clearly that they do in fact object.</li>
</ol>

<p>3. Australian Ministers are clearly obsessed with pending elections.</p>

<p>4. I will do my best at resumed meetings on Tuesday morning to mitigate offensive passages, but I have not much hope of eliminating them. I fear I may end up with communique which implies at best sullen acquiescence in our negotiating. But this would I think be better than having no communique with Australian Ministers free to express their hostility to whole idea of Common Market without restraint.</p>
