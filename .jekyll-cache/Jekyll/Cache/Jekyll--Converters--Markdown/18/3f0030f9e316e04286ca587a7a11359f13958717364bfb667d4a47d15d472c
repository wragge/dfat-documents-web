<p>The following is a summary of the main points of a report in todayâ€™s A.N.P. Bulletin which it is claimed emanates from â€˜competent sourcesâ€™.</p>

<p>1. Netherlands Government was yesterday drafting fresh recommendations for continued negotiations with the Republican Government without the mediation of the United Nations Good Offices Committee. These would be forwarded to Stikkerâ€™s advisers who were in Batavia.</p>

<p>2. Netherlands Government (it was understood) was compiling a memorandum couching in emphatic terms its attitude towards the present situation. This would be handed to the Republican Government shortly.</p>

<p>3. The Dutch visualised that new negotiations would be extremely short.</p>

<p>4. The present uncertain situation could not be tolerated â€˜much longerâ€™ owing to the agreement with non-Republican territories that the interim Government would be established before January 1st 1949.</p>

<p>5. it was emphatically denied that any agreement had been reached in Djokjakarta between Stikker and Hatta. All talks had been exploratory.</p>

<p>6. Dutch had continually stipulated as a primary condition for the resumption of discussions (a) immediate cessation of animate violations of the truce (b) resumption of goods traffic between the Republican and non-Republican areas.</p>
