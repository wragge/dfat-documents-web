<p>Secret</p>

<p>(The Prime Minister rang the secretary in connection with UN New Yorkâ€™s 608).<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p><em>The Prime Minister</em> asked why we are not coâ€“sponsoring the American resolutions.</p>

<p><em>The Secretary</em> said we have not yet been asked to do so. There were still no firm texts. We had been asked only to coâ€“sponsor the inscription of a new item. But the Americans then decided to do that alone.</p>

<p><em>The Prime Minister</em> said we should stand by our friends. He asked why we were timorous.</p>

<p><em>The Secretary</em> expressed the belief that we should take a long-term view.</p>

<p><em>The Prime Minister</em> said he believed we should support the Americans.</p>

<p>FOOT NOTE</p>

<p>Dr. Cumes told the Secretary that we had not turned our faces against coâ€“sponsorship. We wanted not to be isolated. We would be prepared to join with a large and representative group. The Americans themselves had said they wanted to avoid the impression of collusion with Japan on inscription; they therefore had sponsored alone.</p>
