<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>(Due to arrive Melbourne-9.1.26)</p>

<p>My dear P.M.,</p>

<p>I do not want to continue to bother you by sending all this Communist material [1] addressed personally to you, so that you are practically obliged to read it before passing it to Major Jones. [2] Could I not address it all, properly sealed, to Jones c/o Henderson [3] at your office, and let Jones extract anything of immediate interest or importance for you.</p>

<p>It is all of extreme secrecy as you know, especially the intercepted material. I do not want to suggest anything that would make for any chance of leakage. [4]</p>

<p>I am, Yours sincerely, R. G. CASEY</p>

<p>_1 See Letter 24.</p>

<p>2 Major H. E. Jones, Director of the Investigation Branch in the Commonwealth Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department.</p>

<p>3 Dr Walter Henderson, Head of the External Affairs Branch.</p>

<p>4 Surviving papers suggest that New Scotland Yard material channelled through Casey continued to be addressed to Bruce.</p>

<p>_</p>
