<p>SECRET IMMEDIATE PERSONAL</p>

<p>I cannot but regard the position as set out in your message sent to me through our representative at Singapore [1] as most unsatisfactory particularly in view of the original message contained in your letter handed to me at Singapore on my journey one month ago to Australia. [2] Australia has a primary interest in a just settlement of this problem which has been far too long delayed.</p>

<p>I was made fully aware of the general position some time ago by Lord Inverchapel and I think the time has come when Australia can no longer be excluded from participation; otherwise our difficulties may be further increased.</p>
