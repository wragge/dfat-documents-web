<h2 id="delegations-instructions-commentary">Delegation’s Instructions-Commentary</h2>

<p>The following notes seek to set out the position of the delegation in relation to the instructions communicated in Canberra’s telegram No. 373 of 1 May<a href="#f1">1</a> together with the Defence Committee’s report of 26 April.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>So far the delegation has observed the general instructions set out in paragraph 4 of the cable, namely to seek opportunity to raise matters in discussions with other delegations. The question of an initial statement is still under consideration.</p>

<h3 id="degree-of-support">Degree of support</h3>

<p><em>Points (I) and (II) of instructions and paragraphs 12 to 14 of DC report.</em> No specific action is required of the delegation. The delegation can report what it learns of the position of the countries ‘of critical importance’ to Australia, but it can take no action to stimulate support among them for the treaty while Australia’s own position continues undecided.</p>

<h3 id="manufacture">Manufacture</h3>

<p><em>Point (III) and paragraphs 15 to 21.</em> We are at present awaiting response from the United States delegation about how their interpretation of ‘manufacture’ might be established. The delegation is required to seek instructions as to how the United States interpretation should be placed on record and it might be desirable to recommend that Australia not seek to have the matter publicly dealt with in the United Nations, but seek bilateral assurances from the United States and the United Kingdom. This can be considered further when we see what the United States has to say.</p>
