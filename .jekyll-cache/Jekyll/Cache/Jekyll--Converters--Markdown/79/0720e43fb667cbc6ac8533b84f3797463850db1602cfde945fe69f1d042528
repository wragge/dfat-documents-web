I"ä<p>Cablegram unnumbered 3 June 1940,</p>

<p>Every Australian has watched with pride the great feat of arms at Dunkirk. The amazing capacity there shown to convert defeat into a means of triumph will surely inspire us all with confidence. The holding up of the German plans must also have been of inestimable value to our gallant French Allies. Please convey to all concerned our respect and our gratitude.</p>
