I"Õ<p>Cablegram M64 LONDON, 18 April 1941, 9.25 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 233. [1] Had already taken up this question of war news, and had said somewhat offensively in War Cabinet that the War Office must not under-estimate public intelligence as grossly as British Generals under-estimate German military capacity. Your telegram strengthens my hand and I will pursue the matter.</p>

<p>Reference your request for an appreciation of the Middle East position [2], no use asking for this as position in state of flux.</p>

<p>You may assure Cabinet and the War Council that everything is being done to avert total loss in Greece and to reinforce with all speed with machines-so much more important than men-our position in the Western Desert and Libya. I see Dill [3] tomorrow to press the appointment of Blamey [4] to one of the command. I confess that I have no great confidence in Chiefs-of-Staff who allow Churchill to determine their strategy for them. But you may be assured that I am doing all I can in most difficult and trying circumstances. Canberra is more peaceful than having bombs dropping around you in London, and I will be glad to see the homely countenances of my colleagues once more. Regards.</p>
