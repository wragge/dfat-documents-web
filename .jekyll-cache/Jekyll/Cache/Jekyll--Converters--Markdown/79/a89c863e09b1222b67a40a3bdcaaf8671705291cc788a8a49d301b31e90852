<p>FOLLOWING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My Circulars M. 114 and M. 115. [1]</p>

<p>In support of anything which H.M. Ambassador at Tokyo [2] may say regarding the effect on us of a Japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indies, the United States Ambassador [3] has been authorized by his Government to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs [4] in the sense that, as the United States are doing their utmost generally to keep Britain supplied across the Atlantic, they obviously could not stand by and watch Britainâ€™s lifeline being cut in the Pacific through an attack on Singapore or the Netherlands East Indies.</p>

<p>H.M. Ambassador and the United States Ambassador have agreed to act only if the situation again deteriorates or Matsuoka provides an opening that should not be missed.</p>
