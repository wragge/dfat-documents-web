<p>IMPORTANT RESTRICTED</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Your 31. [1]</p>

<p>Your message No.17 [2], of the 29th January to High Commissioner, London (repeated here as No. 29), was passed on the morning of Saturday, 29th January to the Prime Minister [3] and Secretary of State for External Affairs [4] by hand delivery letter at their request since an effort to obtain an interview with them on that morning had failed.</p>

<p>Canadian press had already indicated on that morning passage of U.S. resolution [5] substantially in original form by the Security Council and it was known that Canada had supported the U.S.</p>

<p>resolution.</p>

<p>Both the Prime Minister and Secretary of State acknowledged receipt of your message regarding United Kingdom policy in writing but did not comment.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the question had already been resolved in the Security Council before arrival of your telegram. I did not seek any further comment from Canadian authorities.</p>

<p>In view of your No. 31, however, I am seeking interview with Secretary of State for External Affairs and result will be telegraphed to you as soon as possible.</p>
