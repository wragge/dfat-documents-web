<p>PRIORITY CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Following are texts of informal exchanges between Minister and United States Ambassador.</p>

<p>I. Informal message from Dr. Evatt in reply to United States Ambassador. Begins:</p>

<p>The Australian Governmentâ€™s view with regard to the recognition of the Communist regime in China accords very largely with the United States Government view.</p>

<p>The Australian Government sees no great urgency in recognition, but believes that recognition should not be unduly delayed if, by delay, the position of the Western Powers is worsened.</p>

<p>In particular, it should be possible, by negotiating in the near future for recognition, to obtain undertakings for the political integrity of neighbouring countries, particularly Hong Kong, and to establish a Commission including representatives of Communist China for the purpose of ensuring the carrying out of these undertakings.</p>

<p>The Australian Government would urge that negotiations should be commenced immediately with the Communist authorities to see whether, in return for recognition at some future date, undertakings would be given to respect the sovereignty of neighbouring territories and to establish a Commission whose duty it would be to see such sovereignty was in fact respected.</p>

<p>Otherwise indefinite delay in granting recognition has no positive advantages; it may easily work to the great disadvantage of all Western Powers.</p>

<p>The Australian Government urges the consultation of United States and Australia in advance so that action taken can be concerted.</p>

<p>Ends.</p>

<p>2. Informal message from United States Ambassador at Canberra.</p>

<p>Begins.</p>

<p>The United States views on the question of possible recognition of the Communist regime in China remain unchanged. The announcement of an established Chinese Communist Government is a long anticipated development and does not in the United States view lend any special urgency to the question of recognition by non- Communist countries. This development does, however, point up the necessity of interested friendly Governments maintaining in their own interest a common attitude respecting the question. The United States Government therefore desires to emphasize the need for a full exchange of views between friendly countries prior to any definite or independent steps looking toward recognition by any of them.</p>
