<p>Your 365 [2] paragraph 1. Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs. Minister desires that you should see Lie and make it clear informally that we disagree with view that positions of Assistant Secretaries General or other positions should be â€˜earmarkedâ€™ for representatives of great powers. We are considering Australian nomination for position of Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs. Please advise. [3]</p>

<p>1 Corrected from unnumbered cablegram of 2 April.</p>

<p>2 Dispatched 27 March, it reported that the position of Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs had been earmarkedâ€™ for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>3 Lie proceeded to make an appointment before an Australian nomination could be made, but he later indicated that more junior positions in the secretariat could well be filled by Australians.</p>
