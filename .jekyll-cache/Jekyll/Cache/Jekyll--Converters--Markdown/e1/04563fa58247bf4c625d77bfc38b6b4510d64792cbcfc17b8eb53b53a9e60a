<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Reference Winch 10. [1] I appreciate your full reply and reciprocate your sentiments on the unity of our efforts.</p>

<p>2. Just as you foresaw events in Europe so we feel that we saw the trend of the Pacific situation more clearly than was realised in London.</p>

<p>3. Events have unfortunately justified our views regarding Malaya and I am very disturbed by reports from Gordon Bennett [2] as to the serious position.</p>

<p>4. The long-distance programme you outline is encouraging but the great need is in the immediate future. The Japanese are going to take a lot of repelling and in the meantime may do very vital damage to our capacity to eject them from the areas they are capturing.</p>
