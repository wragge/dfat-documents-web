I"›<p>Letter LONDON, 3 April 1942</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My dear Bruce, Thank you for letting me see your telegram [1], and for your help in these matters. I must however point out that in your Sub- section (2) you use the expression â€˜if Australia is in deadly perilâ€™ [2], whereas what I said and mean is â€˜if Australia is being heavily invadedâ€™. And again, in Sub-section (4) you use the expression â€˜a major threat to Australiaâ€™. [3] I have never said anything about diverting troops to meet threats. We cannot do so while they are most urgently needed on fronts where heavy fighting is proceeding.</p>

<p>Please also see the words of my pledge of August 11, 1940, where the expression is â€˜If â€¦. Japan set about invading Australia or New Zealand on a large scaleâ€™. [4] It is very important there should be no misunderstanding about this, as Dr. Evatt from his telegrams clearly holds that Australia is â€˜in deadly perilâ€™ and that â€˜a major threatâ€™ has developed. [5]</p>

<p>WINSTON S. CHURCHILL</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Cablegram E7 of 1 April to Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs. See Document 449, note 9.</p>

<p>2 Subsection 2 reported Churchillâ€™s pledge â€˜that help will be sent at whatever cost and whatever sacrifice if Australia is in deadly perilâ€™.</p>

<p>3 Subsection 4 reported â€˜that if â€¦ a major threat to Australia develops he [Churchill] will divert at Capetown reinforcements and supplies whether designed for Middle East, India or Burma including the armoured division now on the seaâ€™.</p>

<p>4 See Document 454, paragraph 2.</p>

<p>5 See Document 438 and Document 449, note 1.</p>
