I"C<p>Buckingham Palace, 25 October 1974</p>

<p>Personal And Confidential</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your letter of 24th October and for having sent me Morrice James’ account of a discussion after dinner, which Mr Whitlam gave in honour of Prince Charles, at which UK/ Australian Constitutional matters were discussed.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>I showed this to The Queen this morning who read it with interest. I wonder if Prince Charles was as mute as is suggested by Morrice’s letter!</p>

<p>Whitlam, of course, said nothing new but the fact that the conversation took place emphasizes, in my view, that these difficult questions are not going to go away.</p>
