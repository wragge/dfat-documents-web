<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>1. The first five paragraphs of your P. 74 [1] miss the point of my No. 47 [2] which was as follows:</p>

<p>(a) Paragraph 2 shows that according to your P. 64 [3] the suggestion for the retention of the 9th Division originated from the President. [4]</p>

<p>(b) Paragraph 3 shows that according to Dominions Office No. 311 [5] the Presidentâ€™s message agreed to the proposal that had been put to him.</p>

<p>(c) Paragraph 4 draws your attention to this difference and indicates in view of the decisions already taken by the Australian Government that the disposition of the A.I.F. is not a matter for bilateral discussion between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [6] and the President. It is one for the Pacific Council.</p>

<p>This is an illustration of our viewpoint on a Pacific Council in Washington where we would have a direct contact with the President. As indicated in my No. 47 no decision has been reached, the matter having been referred to Evatt [7] for discussion with the President.</p>

<p>2. I do not understand your references to Churchill and concealment of his discussion with the President. No one made any such suggestion. [8]</p>
