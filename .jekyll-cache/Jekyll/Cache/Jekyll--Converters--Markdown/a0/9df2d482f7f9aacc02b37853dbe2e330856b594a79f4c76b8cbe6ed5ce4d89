<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>My immediately following telegram [1] contains the text of a message from Ballard. [2] We are considering taking similar action ourselves. Decision in Council on your resolution [3] should not be postponed because of United States Consul-Generalâ€™s action.</p>

<p>Replies to United States and to us from Indonesians need no clarification. Assume you are in close touch with Sjahrir, who should reiterate need for arbitration and acceptance of United States and Australian proposal.</p>
