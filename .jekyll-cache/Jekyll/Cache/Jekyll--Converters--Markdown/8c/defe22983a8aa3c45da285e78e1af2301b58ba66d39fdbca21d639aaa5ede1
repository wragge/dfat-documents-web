<p>[Repeated to] London No. 19, Washington No. 19.</p>

<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs [1] has told the British Ambassador [2] that reports of movements of troops and what was regard[ed] as defensive preparations in Australia and elsewhere have resulted in strong pressure by the Army and Navy to send more troops south which he is resisting. The Ambassador believes that the Minister is speaking the truth. These reports have had increased salutary effect, but I suggest now advisable to restrict further publicity on such matters and any possible provocative statements as far as possible.</p>
