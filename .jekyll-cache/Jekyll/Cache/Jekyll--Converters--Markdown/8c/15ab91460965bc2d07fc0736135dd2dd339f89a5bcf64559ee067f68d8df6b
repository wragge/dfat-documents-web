<p><strong>CER: Elimination of Import Restrictions in Reasonable Time</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Further to our separate message, you should know that very informal soundings have been taken of Manufacturers Federation Secretariat and Stevens (President) only of elected officers. A wider consultation with the Manufacturers Federation at this sensitive time (Federation conference later this month) would inevitably bring an unhelpful reaction.</li>
  <li>We have taken account of their reactions in suggesting following approach in your response to Australian officials. We suggest you initially try the following formulation: <br />
‚ÄòAt the end of the tariff phasing period, there would be a review which would examine the progress towards liberalisation of access restrictions and assess what further action may be necessary consistent with the objectives of a closer economic relationship.‚Äô<br />
Depending on the Australian response you might then want to move to the following:<br />
‚ÄòAt the end of the tariff phasing period, there would be a review which would examine the progress towards liberalisation of import restrictions and assess what needed to be done to effect complete removal of the remaining restrictions by a terminal date to be considered at the review and which would be consistent with the objective of ‚Äúreasonable time‚Äù.‚Äô <br />
This is in line with the approach put to the CEC.</li>
  <li>Point made in para 3 of our earlier immediate message replying to your 3004 of course applies.</li>
