<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>As we were leaving Yokohama, Ball intimated that the would fly to Australia in a few days on private business and would subsequently attend the Canberra Conference. This was in complete contradiction to his undertaking to me earlier in the same day that he would remain at his post for some weeks, at any rate until after my arrival in Australia. His temperament and capricious attitude might be obstruction to the Conference. On the other hand I think that subject to Defence approval, Robertson’s presence in Canberra would be very helpful on postwar Japan arrangements. Ball and Plumridge [1] seem to have been in closest touch with press men with anti-MacArthur obsessions.</p>

<p>Probably Ball’s attendance at the Conference is no longer of any advantage and at any rate he should be given direct instructions to remain at his post for the present because of the need for conversations with other British Governments concerned in Australia he represents.</p>

<p>The question of Robertson’s coming can await my return.</p>
