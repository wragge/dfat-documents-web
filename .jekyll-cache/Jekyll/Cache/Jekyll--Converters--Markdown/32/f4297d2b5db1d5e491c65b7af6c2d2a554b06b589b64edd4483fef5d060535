<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>We have received no reports of the Security Council, not even the United States resolution. [1] It would be helpful if we were kept informed. Now that the Dutch have flatly rejected the United States proposals and demonstrated that they have no intention of handing over sovereignty for years to come which is, of course, obvious from the expenditure in man-power and resources they have been prepared to make to hold position, perhaps the United States can be persuaded to take more effective unilateral action than merely terminating Netherlands East Indies orders. N.E.I.</p>

<p>deliveries to Holland orders should be the next step.</p>
