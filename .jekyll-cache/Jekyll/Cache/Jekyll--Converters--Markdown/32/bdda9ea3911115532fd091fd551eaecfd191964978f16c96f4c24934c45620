I"Ý<p>Canberra, 20 October 1972</p>

<p>I have been asked by my Prime Minister to send you the following message:â€“</p>

<p>(begins)</p>

<p>â€˜During our discussions in London last November I mentioned the possible transfer of responsibility for Australia House to our Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I have decided to go ahead with the transfer with effect from 1st November.</p>

<p>As I recall our talk, you saw no difficulties about this, but you expressed the view, with which I concurred, that despite the change in administration the British High Commissioner in Canberra should retain the right of direct access to me, and our High Commissioner to you.</p>

<p>You will note from my Press statement that the organisational arrangements to be made will give support to this link. I need hardly add that it is our intention that the change make no difference to the close and understanding relationship between our people and Governments.â€™</p>
