<p>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE AGENDA (Pacific Conference Papers-Agenda No. 6)</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, By resolution of the conference on the 18th January, 1944 it was agreed to postpone consideration of Item 3 (c) [1] until the Notes on the Agenda [2] had been considered and reported on by the respective civil aviation advisers of the Delegations.</p>

<p>This report was received, and subsequently considered by the Committee on the Agenda appointed in accordance with the direction of the conference in Resolution No. 4. [3]</p>

<p>The following recommendations have now been agreed to and are submitted to conference:-</p>

<p>Paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 (i) are agreed to, subject to the following understanding as regards 25 (i) (C). [4]</p>

<p>The two Governments are unanimous in support of the principle that (1) ownership, operation and control of the international air routes should be vested in the International Air Transport Authority, and (2) that in any devolution to national authorities by the international authority for the management of international trunk routes that may be made, then such national organization should operate under the flag and the uniform of the international authority.</p>

<p>It was agreed that paragraph 25 (ii) be amended as follows:-</p>

<p>(ii) This statement of principle has been amplified by the declaration of certain national needs which Australia and New Zealand would wish to have recognized within the framework of an international agreement. These are:-</p>

<p>(a) The right of each country to conduct all services within her own national jurisdiction including her own contiguous territories, subject only to agreed international requirements regarding safety and commitments in respect of the proposed international air authority in regard to facilities, landing and transit rights for international services, exchange of mails, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(b) The recognition of the need for Australia and New Zealand to be included in one regional panel, coincident as far as practicable with the Australian - New Zealand regional defence zone, which would authorize, under the International Air Transport Authority, the establishment and control of air services to contiguous territories which fall within the particular area of security, trade, communications and development of each country.</p>

<p>The New Zealand delegation do not wish to include the phrase â€˜including foreignâ€™.</p>

<p>(c) In the event of failure to obtain international agreement to establish international trunk routes, the two Governments agree to support the principle of British Commonwealth trunk routes.</p>

<p>(d) The recognition of the right of Australia and New Zealand to utilize to the fullest extent their productive capacity in respect of aircraft and raw materials; and of the right to use a fair proportion of Australian and New Zealand personnel, agencies and materials in operating and maintaining international trunk routes.</p>

<p>The Australian and New Zealand Governments agree to act jointly in support of the abovementioned principles, whether in a further conference between the members of the British Commonwealth or on an international plane, and to inform the other Government of its existing interests and commitments, as a basis of common policy.</p>

<p>This agreement obviates the necessity for the adoption of paragraphs 26, 27 and 28.</p>
