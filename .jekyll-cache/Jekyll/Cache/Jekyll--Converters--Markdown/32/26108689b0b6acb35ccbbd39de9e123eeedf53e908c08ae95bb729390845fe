I"¢<p>Cablegram 13, TOKYO, [12 August 1946]</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>(1) On 7th August S.C.A.P. authorized the resumption of Antarctic whaling by Japanese under the following conditions.</p>

<p>(a) Fleets limited to two factory ships, 12 whalers, 7 carriers.</p>

<p>(b) This authorization does not establish any precedent.</p>

<p>(c) No vessel must approach within 12 Miles of land.</p>

<p>(d) Vessels must leave and return to Japan between 1st November, 1946, and 30th April, 1947.</p>

<p>(e) Japanese must observe International Whaling Convention.</p>

<p>(2) S.C.A.P. announces that oil produced will be distributed to the needy countries by International Emergency Food Council. There is an acute world shortage of whale oil.</p>

<p>(3) This authorization was made without consulting Allied Council.</p>

<p>It is quite distinct from action taken on 12th June with approval of Chinese and British members of the Council to authorize a temporary extension of fishing grounds in waters near Japan.</p>

<p>[4] Since Derevyanko likely to raise this issue at the next meeting please instruct me earliest.</p>
