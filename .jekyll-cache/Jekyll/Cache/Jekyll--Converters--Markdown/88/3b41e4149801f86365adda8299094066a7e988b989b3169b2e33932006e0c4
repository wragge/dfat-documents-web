<p>SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>The news of the signature on Saturday of the agreement reference the cease fire was received with general relief, and there was a surprising absence of criticism even from the extreme right. Now the news that the Republican delegates would accept six principles only, subject to a clarification which the Dutch authorities did not know of, has roused a storm of criticism. The Government has confirmed itself to a short statement the exact text of which is contained in my next following telegram 12.</p>

<p>2. I discussed the situation this morning at the Foreign Ministry who have not received yet, the clarification given by the Commission. [1] The new head of the Political Section did not hide his anxiety at the situation, nor his fear that acceptance by the Government of the six principles now, would precipitate a political crisis.</p>

<p>3. He spoke in a most friendly way of the good work of both Kirby and Critchley.</p>
