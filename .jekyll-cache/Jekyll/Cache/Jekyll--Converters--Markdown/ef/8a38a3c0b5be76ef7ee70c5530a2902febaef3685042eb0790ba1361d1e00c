<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>We are most grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions contained in your telegram No. 133 of 11th October [1] which was before the War Cabinet this morning when the draft statement was further examined. You will have seen from my telegram Circular D.36 [2] that the draft statements had already been revised in a sense which I feel sure you will agree corresponds with your observations.</p>

<p>Since the receipt of your telegram, the text has been further amended and will be considered finally at tomorrow morningâ€™s War Cabinet. This latest version incorporates some of the ideas and, in certain instances, the actual words used in the latter part of your telegram.</p>
