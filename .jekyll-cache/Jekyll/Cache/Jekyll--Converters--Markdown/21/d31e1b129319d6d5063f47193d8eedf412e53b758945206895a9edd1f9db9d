<p>IMPORTANT RESTRICTED</p>

<p>1. We have received full reports from Security Council to effect that Committee is to observe cease-fire. This is all that is left after U.S. clause asking for assessment of responsibility by Committee and clause requiring withdrawal were defeated.</p>

<p>2. Any hope of getting more effective action from Council now depends solely on the report submitted by Committee. Council will not act until your report received.</p>

<p>3. Task of Committee seems hopeless and you should make point of telling Council so especially the consequences of requiring cease- fire without Dutch withdrawal. Security Council have to be more realistic and stop dodging main issues.</p>

<p>4. United States view is that freedom of movement for Committee and military observers is essential for reporting on events and that most effective course is for Committee itself to press their requirements on Dutch in strongest terms as was done for return of party from Kaliurang. We are inclined to agree.</p>
