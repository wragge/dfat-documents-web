I"<p>Letter CANBERRA, 8 June 1949</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter [1] of 23rd May and for your cordial references to the part that Australia has played in trying to achieve a just and lasting settlement in Indonesia.</p>

<p>I trust that as a result of the preliminary agreement [2] of 7th May 1949, your Government will soon be restored to Djokjakarta, and that this will open the way to the establishment of a United States of Indonesia. You may rest assured that Australia will continue to exercise the utmost vigilance in fulfilling the obligations she has undertaken through her membership on the United Nations Commission for Indonesia.</p>
