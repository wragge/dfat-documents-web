<p>I spoke to Mr Bowen in Sydney on Thursday, 4 May, about ‘the Australia House’ passage in his speech. We discussed it.</p>

<p>2. I said—and he agreed—that the words ‘in this context’ are not well chosen and gave the wrong impression.</p>

<p>3. I suggested that I take the paragraph away and let him know on the next day of my ideas for redrafting.</p>

<p>4. He said he also would look at the words.</p>

<p>5. I rang on the following day to propose the words now shown on the text.</p>

<p>6. The Minister told me that he had made his own alterations and had introduced 1 July as the effective date.</p>

<p>7. I said I believed there was no warrant for this. It might well tum out to be the date but I would not want it stated until I could have a discussion with the Prime Minister. This had not yet been possible.</p>

<p>8. The Minister said that in the circumstances he would take the reference out but he would be speaking to the Prime Minister and may have the opportunity to raise it.</p>

<p>9. I said even so, I would not want the Prime Minister to agree to it without there first being an opportunity for me to talk to him. I would not be able to do this before next week.</p>

<p>10. Mr Bowen took note of my suggestions for a redraft.</p>
