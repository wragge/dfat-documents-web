I"É<p>Cablegram [Johcu 2] [1] CANBERRA, 31 October 1941</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>In continuation of my telegram No. 1 last paragraph. [2] Reference Winch 1 [3] we are very gratified with advice of proposed disposition of capital ships and particularly your reference to the PRINCE OF WALES.</p>

<p>2. This action, together with proposed diplomatic steps you have in hand, and on which I am cabling our views separately through Dominions Office [4], should force Japan into the position of again weighing most seriously the consequences of further aggression either northwards or southwards. If forced into a conflict we will have certainly done all we can to deter her and our defensive position in the Eastern Hemisphere will be all the stronger for the measures that have been taken.
