I"†<p>Cablegram unnumbered 6 September 1939,</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 7, 3rd September [1] His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is in entire agreement with view of His Majestyâ€™s Government in Canada that an exchange of High Commissioners between Ottawa and Canberra would strengthen materially means of intercourse and co-operation between the two Dominions in the difficult period ahead. It would therefore welcome cordially the appointment of a Canadian High Commissioner in Canberra at an early date and intends for its part to make a reciprocal appointment of an Australian High Commissioner to Canada as soon as necessary arrangements can be completed.</p>

<p>Announcement of the Governmentâ€™s decision to this effect will be made by me in the House of Representatives tomorrow September 7 [2] to coincide with announcement to be made by His Majestyâ€™s Government in Canada, as I understand from your telegram, on the same date.</p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
