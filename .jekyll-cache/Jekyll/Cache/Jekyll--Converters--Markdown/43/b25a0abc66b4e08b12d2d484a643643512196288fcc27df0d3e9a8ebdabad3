<p>213. Secret</p>

<p>Your 192.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>Minister is somewhat disturbed at statement in your paragraph 4 that Malaya is prepared to discuss agenda for Ministerial talks provided Malaysia is not included as a subject for discussion. He wants you to emphasise to Tunku that while we share his view that Malaysia is not negotiable, we feel it is essential that he gives a clear and reasoned exposition of Malaysia to both Philippines and Indonesia. This is important if for no other reason than to stop Subandrio saying that while the British have consulted him, he has never had a word from the Tunku. More important, if we are to give the Indonesians and Filipinos some excuse for a public change of position, they must be able to say they are satisfied as a result of Malayan explanations. Please keep up the pressure on these lines.</p>
