I"í<p>Cablegram 16 LONDON, 31 May 1940, 10 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE FOR MR CASEY HIMSELF PERSONALLY</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 29. [2]</p>

<p>Halifax [3] asked me to convey his appreciation of your presentation of position [to] Sumner Welles [4] which he considers admirable.</p>

<p>As I felt effect might be prejudiced if (it was) thought here your action has been prompted by me, I substituted in second paragraph for reference to my opinion â€˜my information was that opinion was strongly heldâ€™.</p>

<p>I also eliminated third paragraph as I felt it would be considered particularly by the Prime Minister [5] too defeatist and would prevent cable receiving consideration it deserves.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Although received in the Legation at this time, the cablegram was not delivered to Casey until 9.30 a.m. on 1 June 1940.</p>

<p>2 Document 319.</p>

<p>3 U.K. Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>4 U.S. Under-Secretary of State.</p>

<p>5 Winston S. Churchill.</p>
