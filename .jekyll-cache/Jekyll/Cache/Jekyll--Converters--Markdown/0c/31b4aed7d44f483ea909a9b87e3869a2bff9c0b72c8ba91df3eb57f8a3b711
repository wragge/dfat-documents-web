<p>Canberra,</p>

<p>Moved by a desire to promote and maintain commerce and trade between Japan and Australia at the highest possible level, and having agreed to the Australian Governmentâ€™s proposal to exchange the requests of both Governments regarding those matters which they wish to include in a trade agreement between the two countries, the Japanese Embassy, on behalf of its home Government, submits to the Australian Government its requests concerning</p>

<p>Japanese exports to Australia which are set forth as follows:</p>

<p>(1) That the Australian Government will apply G.A.T.T. provisions to commerce and trade between Japan and Australia, extending particularly Most-Favoured-Nation treatment with respect to customs tariff to Japanese products which are imported in the Australian markets, and</p>

<p>(2) That the Australian Government will abolish the discriminatory treatment in the licensing of certain Japanese commodities mentioned in the Reserved List [1], thereby placing Japanese commodities on not less favourable footing than those from other non-dollar countries in the import licensing system.</p>
