<p>PERSONAL AND SECRET</p>

<p>It is all right your sending a telegram like your 344 [1] to me through the High Commissioner [2], but if it is anything purely personal I would rather it came to me direct, and there are some things I must say to you in Australia that I should not care to mention to a single soul here beyond our limited circle. I think it important we should preserve a direct channel for exceptional messages. Such messages should begin WINCH. Does this suit you? Let me know.</p>

<p>2. We go into Syria tomorrow morning in considerable force. The other plan about which you know will be a little later. I cannot guarantee results about Syria as it all depends upon which way the two French cats jump. Am more hopeful of the other business. [3]</p>

<p>3. I feel very much for you in all your difficulties. I cannot help being hopeful about the future. Second part of JAGUAR [4] about 50 in all, got through last night.</p>
