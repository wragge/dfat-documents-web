<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>The Australian Minister for Immigration stresses that he undertook that the Indonesians would be landed at ports of their choice, namely, at Sourabaya. and Medan. He has strongly represented to me that the landings should be permitted at those ports especially at Sourabaya. I should be grateful if you would take this into consideration in connection with my telegram of 22nd October. [1]</p>

<p>I understand that projected Military developments might facilitate entry at Sourabaya.</p>
