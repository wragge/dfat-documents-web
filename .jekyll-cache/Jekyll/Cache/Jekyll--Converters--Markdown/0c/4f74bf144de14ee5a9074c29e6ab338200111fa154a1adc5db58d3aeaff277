I"V<p>Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 18 March 1938</p>

<p>SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Many thanks for your telegram of 16th March. [1] I am glad that the information which I gave has been of assistance and that the press are proving helpful in informing the minds of the public. I think the obscurity to which you refer must be due to an error in decyphering my telegram. [2] The passage in question reads :-</p>

<p>‘The idea that in the event of war we may not be able to defend our overseas possessions is entirely false.’ I trust this will clear up the difficulty.</p>

<p>NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN</p>

<p>2 A note attached to this cable in Canberra stated that Chamberlain’s original message had been checked and that the error had occurred in ciphering in London.</p>
