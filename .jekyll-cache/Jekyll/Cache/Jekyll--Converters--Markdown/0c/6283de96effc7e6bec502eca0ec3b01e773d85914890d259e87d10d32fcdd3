I"ó<p>Cablegram 442 NEW DELHI, 9 November 1948</p>

<p>A broad survey which Nehru gave yesterday to the Constituent Assembly contained the following points:</p>

<p>(i) He had entered into no commitment in London with regard to Indiaâ€™s membership of the Commonwealth; this was essentially a matter for the Constituent Assembly. Possibly the question would come up in the course of the current session in a more concrete form.</p>

<p>(ii) In whatever form it should arise, the question was something apart from, and in a sense independent of, the Constitution now being considered. He said â€˜we pass that constitution for an independent sovereign democratic India, for a republic as we choose, and the second question has to be considered separately at whatever time it suits the House.â€™ (iii) The Objectives Resolution of January 22nd 1947 declaring India a sovereign independent republic must stand unless the Constituent Assembly changed it.</p>
