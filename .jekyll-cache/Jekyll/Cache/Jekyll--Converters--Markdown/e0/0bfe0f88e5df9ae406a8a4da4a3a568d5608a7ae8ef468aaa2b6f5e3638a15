I"©<p>Circular Cablegram B113 LONDON, 18 October 1937, 11.23 p.m.</p>

<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Following for Prime Minister:-</p>

<p>My Circular B.112. [1] We have been considering very carefully the attitude to be adopted when the Conference relating to the 1922 Treaty meets. [2] My immediately succeeding telegram [3] contains a summary of the considerations which now present themselves to us, but it win be realised that much must depend upon the course of events before the Conference actually meets. We should of course be very grateful for any observations upon the position or upon our attitude as outlined in that telegram. It is hoped in any case that there may be opportunities for full discussion with Dominion representatives at the Conference as soon as they have been appointed, and are available. The substance of our views has also been communicated to the United States Government through His Majestyâ€™s Ambassador at Washingtonâ€™ in similar terms.</p>
