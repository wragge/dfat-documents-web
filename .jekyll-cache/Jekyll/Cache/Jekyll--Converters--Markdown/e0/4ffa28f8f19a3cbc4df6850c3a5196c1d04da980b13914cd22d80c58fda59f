<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Setyadjid was killed four days ago, while Alimin and a number of other important communists were captured on October 10. The net is reported to be closing around Muso, Sjarifuddin and the other communists.</p>

<p>2. Communists are suspected of murdering Muwardi, leader of the G.R.R. (see paragraph 3 of my telegram K. 158 [1]) whose mutilated body was found outside Solo.</p>

<p>3. The Republican Government has been endeavouring to suppress the news of Setyadjidâ€™s death and fears that a rising tide of dissension may follow news of killings and counter killings.</p>
