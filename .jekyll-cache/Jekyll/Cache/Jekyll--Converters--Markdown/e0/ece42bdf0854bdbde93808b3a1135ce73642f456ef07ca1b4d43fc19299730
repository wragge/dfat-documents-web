<p>AUSTUNAT 608</p>

<p>The penultimate Cabinet decision* <a href="#f1">1</a> on China said that we were not to take a vanguard role or be activist (April 1971 ).<a href="#f2">2</a> Nevertheless, the Department had got involved in a big way in a discussion of tactics by floating its own resolutions. Now it seems that the US, New Zealand and Japan are less impressed by these. Irrespective of the Departmentâ€™s views on the merits of our own proposed tactics, surely we should now be pulling our heads in a bit and letting the US make whatever running is to be made.</p>

<p>2. Sir L. Mcintyre seems to go further than this and implies that we should give the US full support for its resolution. Otherwise, we will â€˜raise some eyebrowsâ€™. Others (incl. US) donâ€™t worry so much about raising eyebrows. Nor should we. Only Cabinet should decide the support we give to the US resolutionsâ€”i.e. whether we vote for, coâ€“sponsor, or abstain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The last Cabinet Decision was 26/7,<a href="#f3">3</a> when, after some discussion, Cabinet expressed the view that the US might desert Taiwan. In between these Cabinet decisions, matters have been decided by the Prime Minister.</li>
  </ul>
