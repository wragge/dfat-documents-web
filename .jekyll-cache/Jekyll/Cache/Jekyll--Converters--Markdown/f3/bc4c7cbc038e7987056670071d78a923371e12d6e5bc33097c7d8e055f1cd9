<p>1 Dispatched 21 February. It recommended Australian support for India’s request to be represented on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

<p>2 Indian claims were supported by the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and both India and the Philippines were represented on the tribunal.</p>
