<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>My telegram 127. [1]</p>

<p>Before the receipt of your telegram 92 I had seen the Secretary General this morning as Minister for Foreign Affairs was occupied with Parliamentary business and spoke much on the lines of your paragraph three.</p>

<p>2. Mr Lovink assured me once again that the Netherlands Government would miss no opportunity of securing a settlement. But some parts of the United States proposals [2] they could not accept because they would have no hope of securing later necessary Parliamentary approval (by two thirds majority). They would have to work [with] [3] Good Offices Committee and try and secure a compromise. He hoped Hatta too, would be prepared to negotiate and not ask for more than proposals.</p>

<p>3. He expressed grave concern at the situation in the Republic.</p>

<p>The possibilities were (a) that Hatta would overcome the Communists (b) that the Communists would overthrow Hatta (c) a compromise.</p>

<p>Personally he expected (c) and that Hatta will go more to the left and an agreement be more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>4. Meanwhile indications were that the Communists will try to manipulate provocative Dutch intervention but if not would do their utmost to avoid any such step.</p>

<p>5. I am advising Doctor Evatt of paragraphs two, three and four.</p>
