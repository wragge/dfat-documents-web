<p>Dr. Evatt has completed his visit to Japan and sailed for home this morning and it has been a source of pleasure and satisfaction to everyone to have had him here. He has represented your country with skill and distinction and has added to its national prestige.</p>

<p>He has been of marked assistance with regard to occupation problems and has made a distinct contribution to the furthering of a treaty of peace. It is needless to add that he has rendered more vivid the indissoluble ties of cordiality and friendship forged between our two countries during our common war struggle in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Thank you for permitting him to come.</p>
