I")<p>Cablegram 631 LONDON, 9 November 1939</p>

<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>Washington. The position has developed in two directions. Upon my putting in the request to the Foreign Office to move Lothian [1] to approach the United States Govt., Eden [2] made strong representations to me against my leaving the United Kingdom even temporarily at the present time and asked my consent to his speaking to the Prime Minister [3] about it. This I gather he has now done and I have an impression, although of this I have no confirmation, that the Prime Minister is cabling you personally.</p>

<p>(2) I have now fully discussed the question with Casey [4] who has seen this cable. He feels that the final decision should remain in abeyance until you and he have the opportunity of discussing the question on his return.</p>

<p>In view of this and pending further instructions from you, I have asked the Foreign Office to advise Lothian not to approach the United States Government for the moment.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Lord Lothian, U.K. Ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>2 Anthony Eden, U.K. Dominions Secretary.</p>

<p>3 Neville Chamberlain.</p>

<p>4 R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development, then in London.</p>
