<p>Security 502.</p>

<p>Council on October 9th continued discussion on Indonesia. United States and Belgium both opposed the Soviet resolution [1] and suggested that Council should await final Consular report. Both countries referred to establishment of Commission of Three and expressed belief that this Commission would be sta[bi]lising factor.</p>

<p>Netherlands replied to various points raised in debate.</p>

<p>Philippines and Soviet Union spoke in support of Indonesia. Soviet emphasised that point at issue is how to resolve situation which has arisen as result of Dutch aggression.</p>

<p>Chairman proposed that next meeting should be held after receipt of final Consular report. This was opposed by Australia, Poland and Soviet Union on the ground that no set date was fixed for delivery of report. We indicated our intention of submitting alternative resolution to Soviet proposal, as follows:-</p>

<p>In order to ensure the observance of its cease fire order, the Security Council requests the Government of the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia to withdraw their respective forces at least five kilometres behind the positions held at date of cease fire order of August 1st.</p>
