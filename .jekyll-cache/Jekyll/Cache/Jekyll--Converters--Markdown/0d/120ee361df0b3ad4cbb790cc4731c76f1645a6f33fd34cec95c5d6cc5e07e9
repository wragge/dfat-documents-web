<p>Your telegram of 25th May. [1] Minister for Colonies [2] informed the Commercial Secretary of this Embassy [3] on 26th May that he intended to arrive at a decision regarding the Timor Oil concessions before leaving with the President of the Republic [4] for Mozambique on June 20th. He added that it would not be possible to give Mr Dodson [5] the whole area he had asked for. The Commercial Secretary considers that he will give him the area covered by the old Staughton concession [6] and that Wittouck [7] has certain rights which cannot easily be rescinded.</p>
