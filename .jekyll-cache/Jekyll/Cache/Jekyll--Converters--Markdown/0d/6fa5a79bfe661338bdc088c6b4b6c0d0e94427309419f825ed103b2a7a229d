<p>Immigration into Britain</p>

<p>I saw Sir Morrice James this morning and made the following points:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) We have not wished to become publicly involved in a British controversy. Our Acting High Commissioner therefore refrained from comment on the proposed new rules.</p>

  <p>(b) The Australian Government has taken the view that each country has the right to determine its own immigration policies, and we therefore did not make representations to the British on the proposed rules.</p>

  <p>(c) We recognise the need for changes in British practice as a result of their entry into the EEC, particularly regarding the admission of citizens of EEC member countries.</p>

  <p>(d) However, developments in Britain, including the outcome of the Commonsâ€™ debate will be bound to have an effect on Australian public opinion, which the Government will have to take into account. It is still too early to assess this effect.</p>

  <p>(e) The Australian Government will therefore await the outcome of the British Governmentâ€™s re-examination of the situation, and the formulation by the latter of new proposals, before adopting a definitive position on the question. We therefore look forward to receiving advice of the British Governmentâ€™s intentions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. I expanded on point (b) by saying that we were anxious not to provoke criticism of our own restricted Immigration.</p>
