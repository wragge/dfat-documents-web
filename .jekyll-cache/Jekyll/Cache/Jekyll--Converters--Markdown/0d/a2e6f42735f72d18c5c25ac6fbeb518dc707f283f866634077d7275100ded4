<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram of 23rd May No. 313 [1] paragraph 4. Further consideration has been given to question whether move of Australian forces to Koepang and Ambon could take place prior to outbreak of hostilities with Japan.</p>

<p>Apart from whether Netherlands Government would agree in the absence of definite assurance of British support in the event of Japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indies, such a move would be regarded in Japan as a challenge in present circumstances. As immediate measure therefore it is undesirable. We do not necessarily go so far, however, as to preclude it until hostilities break out. A change in the general situation might conceivably occur before this, which would provide necessary opening without present objections.</p>

<p>In the meantime we fully agree that all preparations for reception of Australian forces should be made unobtrusively in advance with the Netherlands authorities.</p>
