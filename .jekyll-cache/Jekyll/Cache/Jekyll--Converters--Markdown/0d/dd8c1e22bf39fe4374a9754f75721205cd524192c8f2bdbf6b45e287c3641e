I"æ<p>Cablegram 20 6 March 1938,</p>

<p>In connection with the resignation of Mr Eden [1] there has been some confusion and misconception in the minds of the Australian public as to whether there had been in fact a reversal of British foreign policy and withdrawal of support for the principles of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Certain criticisms have appeared with regard to consultation with the Dominions. These as you will appreciate have no substance and of course are not in accordance with fact.</p>

<p>During the last three days my Government has fully considered all aspects of the question [2] and I propose to make the statement contained in my immediately following telegram. [3]</p>
