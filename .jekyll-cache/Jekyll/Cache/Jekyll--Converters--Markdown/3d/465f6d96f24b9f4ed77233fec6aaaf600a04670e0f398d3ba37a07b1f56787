<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 652. [1] Legation in China.</p>

<p>As you will have seen from my telegram No. 339 of 1st July to Secretary of State [2], I asked specifically for views of United Kingdom Government on this question before arriving at definite conclusion. United Kingdom Government replied in telegram No. 265 of 22nd July [3] but I did not find reply very helpful. Would appreciate therefore if you would try to obtain definite expression of United Kingdom Governmentâ€™s (views) on the question of whether in existing circumstances it is thought desirable to take steps in the matter.</p>
