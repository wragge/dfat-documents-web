<p>RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Please repeat to London for Burton.</p>

<p>The Netherlands Delegation has submitted today a reply to the Republican Working Paper [1] (K.300 [2]).</p>

<p>2. ‚ÄòThe Netherlands Government is prepared to agree to a return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta, provided that a binding commitment is obtained on the two other subjects namely, firstly, ‚Äúthat the Republican Government shall order its armed adherents to cease guerilla warfare and co-operate in the restoration of peace and the maintenance of law and order‚Äù and secondly, ‚Äúto make agreements concerning the time and conditions for the holding of a round table conference at The Hague‚Äù.‚Äô [3]</p>

<p>3. Subject to these conditions, the Netherlands intend to submit a counter proposal as to the area to be restored to the Republican Government. The Netherlands Delegation has indicated, informally that it will propose a strictly limited area and will not agree to the inclusion of the Maguwo airfield five miles outside the capital.</p>

<p>4. Van Royen has made it clear that the Netherlands will only consider at these talks the ruling [4] of the Security Council of 23rd March and will not consider gradually enlarging the area under Republican control as required by paragraph four (f) of the 28th January resolution. [5]</p>

<p>5. Unless the Republican delegation makes unexpected concessions a breakdown in the discussions seems inevitable. There is a possibility that Hatta will come to Batavia for informal talks with Van Royen in the next few days.</p>
