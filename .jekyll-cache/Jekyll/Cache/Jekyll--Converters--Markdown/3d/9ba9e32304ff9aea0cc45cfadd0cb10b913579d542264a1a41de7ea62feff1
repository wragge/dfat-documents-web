<p>‘The withdrawal from the United Nations by Indonesia follows a series of actions by that country in defiance of world opinion, rule of law and the United Nations.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>The existence of small independent sovereign nations, like Malaysia, is being threatened by the aggressive, bullying and expansionist tactics of our neighbour.</p>

<p>(a) to ask our allies under the defence agreement to review the latest position and send reinforcements, if necessary;</p>

<p>(b) to inform the United Nations of the seriousness of the threat of more intensive Indonesian attacks and to request the United Nations to assist us in the defence of our nation in the event of such a happening;</p>

<p>(c) to expedite the expansion of our own forces by establishing more training centres throughout the States of Malaysia for the call-up under National Service; and</p>

<p>(d) to be prepared to take retaliatory action under the rule of hot pursuit when and if forced to do so for our own existence.’</p>
