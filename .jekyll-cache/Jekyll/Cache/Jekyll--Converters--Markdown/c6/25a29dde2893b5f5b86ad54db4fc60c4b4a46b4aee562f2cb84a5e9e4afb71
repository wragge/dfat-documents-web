I".<p>Letter [LONDON], 4 July 1940</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Since our talk yesterday morning, I have now had a look at the</p>

<p>telegram about which we spoke [1], and have discussed the matter</p>

<p>with my Staff. They point out that our inability to send a Fleet</p>

<p>to the Far East in the changed circumstances was emphasised in a</p>

<p>telegram to the Dominions, which was drafted by the Chiefs of</p>

<p>Staff as long ago as the 13th June (see Telegram No. Circular Z</p>

<p>No. 106, paragraph 9). [2]</p>

<p>It is, of course, perfectly true that, before the war, it had</p>

<p>always been our intention to despatch a Fleet to the Far East in</p>

<p>the event of serious trouble with Japan. It was said on various</p>

<p>occasions that if it came to a choice of jeopardising either our</p>

<p>Middle East and Mediterranean interests, or the security of the</p>

<p>Empire in the Far East, we should not hesitate to sacrifice the</p>

<p>former. I do not think anything has occurred to alter our point of</p>

<p>view on this.</p>

<p>At present, however, it is not this choice which confronts us.</p>

<p>Owing to the complete collapse of the French and the elimination</p>

<p>of their fleet, there would be nothing now to prevent the Italian</p>

<p>fleet from leaving the Mediterranean and entering the struggle in</p>

<p>the Atlantic and home waters, basing itself on French ports. The</p>

<p>despatch of a Fleet to the Far East, which would involve the</p>

<p>removal of our capital ships from the Mediterranean, would</p>

<p>therefore not only seriously jeopardise our position in the Middle</p>

<p>East, but would endanger the safety of this country and its vital</p>

<p>communications. This being so, it is clearly necessary for us to</p>

<p>make certain of defeating the immediate danger in home waters,</p>

<p>which is for the moment the decisive point, by concentrating our</p>

<p>forces in this area.</p>

<p>This situation, which we hope will be of short duration, does not</p>

<p>invalidate what was said in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum (Paper</p>

<p>No. D.M.V.(39)4) [3], which the present Prime Minister [4]</p>

<p>circulated to Dominion Ministers last November.</p>

<p>The important passage reads as follows:-</p>

<p>‘However, should Japanese encroachment begin, or should Great</p>

<p>Britain pass into a state of war with Japan, the Admiralty would</p>

<p>make such preparatory dispositions as would enable them to offer</p>

<p>timely resistance either to the serious attack upon Singapore or</p>

<p>to the invasion of Australia and New Zealand. These dispositions</p>

<p>would not necessarily take the form of stationing a fleet at</p>

<p>Singapore, but would be of a character to enable the necessary</p>

<p>concentrations to be made to the eastward in ample time to prevent</p>

<p>a disaster.’</p>

<p>The arguments which the Chiefs of Staff would put forward may be</p>

<p>summarily stated as follows: Japan cannot undertake a serious</p>

<p>invasion of Australia so long as:-</p>

<p>(a) The British Fleet (wherever it may be) is in being: and</p>

<p>(b) Singapore is secure.</p>

<p>The first condition still holds good, and it is to ensure the</p>

<p>second condition that the Chiefs of Staff have asked Australia to</p>

<p>send a Division and two Squadrons of aircraft to Malaya.</p>

<p>We could very easily arrange for you to have a discussion with the</p>

<p>Chiefs of Staff on the whole question, if you so desired. In that</p>

<p>event, I feel sure that the discussion would be far more</p>

<p>profitable if you were to let us have a short note on the</p>

<p>particular points which you wished considered.</p>

<p>Alternatively, since the problem is almost exclusively a Naval</p>

<p>one, I wonder if you would not get better value out of a talk with</p>

<p>the First Sea Lord. [5] If you will let me know what you would</p>

<p>like, I will arrange it for you.</p>

<p>I ought to add that the telegram on the position in the Middle</p>

<p>East, which you mentioned in our talk this morning, was completed</p>

<p>by the Chiefs of Staff last night, and has today, I think, been</p>

<p>despatched to the Dominions. [6]</p>
