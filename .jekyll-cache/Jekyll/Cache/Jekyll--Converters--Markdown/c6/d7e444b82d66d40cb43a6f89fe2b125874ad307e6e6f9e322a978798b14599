<p>Cablegram SC21 CANBERRA, 5 November 1942</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Your S.132. Extraterritorial treaty. [1]</p>

<p>1. Minister desires you to negotiate treaty at Chungking and he wishes you to know you have his complete confidence in respect of this matter. He desires a short treaty dealing with abrogation of extraterritorial rights, avoiding the contentious clauses six and eight of the United Kingdom draft. [2]</p>

<p>2. The views of other Dominions, except New Zealand, indicate they also will negotiate separate treaty without inclusion of these clauses. [3]</p>

<p>3. At the same time there should be provision in Australian treaty for future negotiations without definite time limit for trade arrangements so important to our respective countries.</p>

<p>4. It is suggested negotiations commence without delay, with view to simultaneous announcement of U.S.A., United Kingdom and Australian signatures.</p>

<p>5. As to your question of interpretation Article 1, paragraph 2 [4], it should be made very clear, to remove any doubts, that British subjects as well as protected persons must belong to territories in respect of which treaty is made. This point should be raised with United Kingdom negotiators.</p>

<p>6. You will of course keep us informed of course of conversations and telegraph your draft texts before final commitments.</p>

<p>7. We are telegraphing London for full powers for you to be sent direct to Chungking. [5]</p>
