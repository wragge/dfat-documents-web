<p>IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 16.</p>

<p>I am prepared to leave all arrangements for the journey to Tokyo to MacArthur and will make my plans accord with any schedule he may decide upon. I think that a message should be routed through Shedden, Ball being kept informed. It could be indicated by Shedden that I should be pleased to fly from Kure to Tokyo if this should be recommended by MacArthur, say on Saturday following my arrival which is now scheduled for Friday 25th. I see little advantage in a railway journey by night from Kure to Osaka but it may be intended to do this by day which would prove of interest.</p>

<p>It should be made perfectly clear by Shedden that I regard MacArthurâ€™s decision to meet me at the airport as an honour and I am anxious to fit in in every way with his plans, also that I greatly appreciate his courtesy in placing his personal aircraft at my disposal for the journey.</p>
