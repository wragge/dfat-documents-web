<p>MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>1. Much appreciate your valuable work but it is impossible to give detailed consideration and all your voting must be ad referendum.</p>

<p>This is safest as Prime Minister not available and Cabinet meets Thursday.</p>

<p>2. In meantime suggest following drafting amendments- 1. Omit flagrant in early part of preamble before breach.</p>

<p>2. Substitute a full measure of self-government for words their independence towards end of preamble.</p>

<p>3. Instead of date fifteenth March nineteen forty nine three times occurring say at earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>You will appreciate it is impossible to pin down to timetable because it looks impracticable. Next amendment in paragraph A2 four substitute embargoes for restrictions, next omit paragraph B altogether. In second resolution instead of paragraph C suggest a sub-committee of four including Australia to continue to assist in carrying out resolution. This sub-committee could meet New York or elsewhere in any of the countries. Next add as paragraph D following Begins-In event either party not repeat not complying Security Council recommendations above sub-committee should meet again and its members support reference of matter to Assembly in April. Third resolution then becomes unnecessary. Ends.</p>
