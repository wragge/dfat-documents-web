<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Government of Canada, anticipating that difficult problems will face members of the British Commonwealth, has suggested that they appoint High Commissioner in Australia and that we reciprocate.</p>

<p>[1]</p>

<p>On the grounds of maintenance of Empire unity etc. we here are strongly in favour not only of suggested appointments but also similar establishments in South Africa and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Glad if you would ascertain at once from British Government whether they would have any objections, and advise me most urgently as Canadian Government anxious for reply not later than Thursday.</p>
