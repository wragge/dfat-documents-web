<p>The following statement by Dr. Evatt was released today 25th at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</p>

<p>There was declared in Peking on October 1st the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China. The Australian Ambassador, along with other foreign representatives, then received a communication from the newly-established Government requesting recognition of the People’s Republic as the only legal government in China.</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made that any action taken in the matter will be concerted by Australia with the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</p>

<p>As Mr. Acheson, the Secretary of State of the United States Government has indicated, the democratic countries must be assured that- (i) the Government which was set up on 1st October is, in fact, in control of the area it claims;</p>

<p>(ii) it is, in fact, prepared to and capable of carrying out its international obligations; and (iii) it is a government supported by the free will of the majority of the peoples it rules.</p>

<p>Definite and convincing answers to all these questions are required before the question of recognition can be resolved. I make it quite clear to everyone that the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia are in complete accord in their attitude toward the new Government. We certainly wish to maintain the friendly relations with the people of China. But in the absence, however, of firm and specific assurances that the territorial integrity of neighbouring countries, notably Hong Kong, will be respected and that the new China will carry out all its international obligations, recognition cannot be granted any more than admission to the United Nations could be granted.</p>
