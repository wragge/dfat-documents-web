I"Á<p>Cablegram 810 WASHINGTON, 1 June 1942, 6.31 a.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Reciprocal Lend Lease.</p>

<p>(1) I was summoned to the State Department and handed a document which will be telegraphed to you in my immediately following telegram. [1] In form it is a draft exchange of notes between the Australian Minister, Washington, and the Secretary of State indicating Australian willingness to provide reciprocal aid in the widest terms; and agreeing to the inclusion of other United Nations who participate.</p>

<p>(2) It assumes that Australia has already signed a duplicate of the United States-United Kingdom Mutual Aid Agreement of February 23rd [2], and appears to be a standard form for all United Nations. A copy different only in name was handed to the United Kingdom representatives at about the same time. A similar copy is to be given to Mr. Nash. [3]</p>

<p>(3) We are given to understand that the document has been approved by the President [4] and Cordell Hull. [5] It must inevitably supersede discussions with Acheson [6], and will require consultation with United Kingdom which may not agree to the major policy involved. I saw Phillips [7] and will send comments on the foregoing when responding to your 671 [8] just received.</p>

<p>2 Australia had not signed a copy of this agreement, and the U.K.</p>

<p>Ambassador to the United States (Lord Halifax) had signed on behalf of the U.K. Govt only. On 3 September the Commonwealth and U.S. Govts exchanged Notes accepting the principles of the agreement of 23 February. For a discussion of this issue see S. J.</p>
