<p>IMMEDIATE PERSONAL HIMSELF MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Notwithstanding most anxious thought am unable to convince Myself that any usefulness I may have been is not better employed in London than Washington. Recognize however it is for you to determine where I shall be used. My only desire is to render whatever service I can wherever it will be most valuable. I suggest the matter remain in abeyance until we get through the present critical week when I will cable you again fully.</p>
