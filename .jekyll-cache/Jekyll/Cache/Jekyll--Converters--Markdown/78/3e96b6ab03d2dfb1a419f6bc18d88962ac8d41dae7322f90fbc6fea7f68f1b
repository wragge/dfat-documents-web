I"ê<p>Canberra, 15 March 1966</p>

<p>A Submission about the long term future of New Guinea<a href="#f1">1</a> is on todayâ€™s Cabinet list. It is a big Submission and has only been circulated in the last few days. There may well be some munnurings about a subject of this importance and difficulty coming onto the list in a hurry.</p>

<p>2. The answer to give to that is that the Minister for External Affairs<a href="#f2">2</a> has to leave for India at the end of this week, that progress has to be made on the Submission before he returns, and that it is desirable to have a discussion with Mr. Hasluck present.</p>

<p>3. But having said that I now suggest to you that this really is too large a subject to be taken by Cabinet more or less on the run. I think that the Minister for Territories has put forward a very sensible proposal and that very likely it will tum out that it will be adopted. But this is not a matter for the Department of Territories on its own. In our departmental notes to you<a href="#f3">3</a> there is a suggestion for an Interdepartmental Committee which I believe is a good suggestion. But in my view, it would be even better to have a Committee of the Cabinet specially appointed, in which you draw on names rather than on portfolios so that a representative and thinking group of Ministers will apply their minds. A few very senior Ministers would be needed but then Ministers like Senator Gorton,<a href="#f4">4</a> Mr. Bury,<a href="#f5">5</a> Mr. Anthony,<a href="#f6">6</a> Mr. Chaney,<a href="#f7">7</a> Mr. Howson<a href="#f8">8</a> and Mr. Sinclair<a href="#f9">9</a> could be drawn upon.</p>

<p>4. In other words, I would suggest that you allow the discussion to run a certain distance in Cabinet this morning and then refer it to a Cabinet Committee with membership to be arranged by you.<a href="#f10">10</a></p>

<p>10 On 22 March, in a further submission to Holt, Bunting referred to paragraph 3 above, adding: â€˜What I think I omitted to say is that I would be a bit worried about the Minister and Department of Territories, on their own, meeting the New Guinea Select Committee here in Canberra next month â€¦ I would expect that todayâ€™s Cabinet meeting will set a general line or atmosphere for the discussions with the Committee and that, in the light of todayâ€™s meeting, you would nominate, say, two or three Ministers to sit with the Minister for Territories. One might be Senator Gorton and the Attorney-General [Billy Snedden] might also have a placeâ€™ (NAA: A4940, Cl724 part 2).</p>
