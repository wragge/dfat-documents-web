<p>CLEAR THE LINE</p>

<p>Reported here that Prime Minister [1] in House of Commons Stated:(begins) It was for each member of the British Commonwealth to decide the extent to which it would participate in any war in which another member was engaged but I am sure I am right in interpreting the wishes of the people of Britain when I say that if any part of the Empire is attacked we will go to its aid without hesitation (ends).</p>

<p>Glad of immediate advice as to whether Prime Minister used these words. Glad also to receive any amplifying statement which would be useful to me here in compiling comments which I have been asked to make.</p>
