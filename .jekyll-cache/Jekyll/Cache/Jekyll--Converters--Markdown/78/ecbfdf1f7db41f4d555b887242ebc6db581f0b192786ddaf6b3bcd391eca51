<p>Regarding your recommendations following Aitchisonâ€™s report as given in your 898, 3rd January. <a href="#f1">1</a> On your recommendation (c) Minister agrees that no immediate action be taken on meeting with missions but that question of meeting of some or all mission leaders with new Administrator<a href="#f2">2</a> might be reviewed at an early date.</p>

<p>Regarding recommendation (b), action as recommended is being taken through Apostolic Delegate.</p>

<p>Minister accepts recommendation (e) on question of legal assistance.</p>

<p>On recommendations (a) and (b) the Minister has noted your views as stated in your 999 of 4th January<a href="#f3">3</a> that general situation has not changed in last six months and that while there is always risk of incident that risk of clash now not greater than when previously drills were moved into areas against wish of some land owners.</p>

<p>In the light of this advice Minister agrees that arrangements should made with CRA for them to continue their operations such as locating of drills, building roads and drilling on Kokorei land with Administration protection for company personnel and property and if necessary including adequate police detachments. This applies to Panguna grid area and Kokorei locality.</p>

<p>Please report any significant development straight away but in any case let us have a review of the position on January 11th.</p>

<p>Prospecting and mining operations should not be begun in any new area where opposition is likely until whole programme and basis of approach has been approved by incoming Administrator and Minister.</p>
