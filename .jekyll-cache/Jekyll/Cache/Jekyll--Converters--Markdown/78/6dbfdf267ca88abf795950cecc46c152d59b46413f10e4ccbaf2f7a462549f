<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 24. [1] What I suggest is a very brief statement on the lines of that in my immediately following telegram.</p>

<p>2. This avoids any detailed references to the existing situation.</p>

<p>I think this is desirable to prevent any possible suspicion of ‘interference in China’s internal affairs’.</p>

<p>1 Dispatched 3 February, it requested a statement with reference to the present situation, its causes and future.</p>
