<p>Your 1067. Recognition of Communist Government at Peking.</p>

<p>Following is text of Australian reply to Chou En-lai:</p>

<p>â€˜His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia are carefully considering the communication from the Central Peopleâ€™s Government in Peking. Meanwhile, in view of the friendly and mutually profitable relations, both commercial and political, which have existed hitherto between Australia and China, the Australian Government suggests that, pending completion of the study of the communication, informal relations should be maintained between the Australian Embassy Office at Nanking and the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai and the appropriate Chinese authorities for the greater convenience of both Governments and the promotion of trade between the two countriesâ€™.</p>
