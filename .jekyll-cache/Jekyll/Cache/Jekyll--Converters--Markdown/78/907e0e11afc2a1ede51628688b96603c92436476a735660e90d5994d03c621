I"Ù<p>Cablegram 28 LONDON, 11 January 1940, 8.35 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF MOST</p>

<p>I had strongly represented to the United Kingdom Government points</p>

<p>included in My telegram No. 27 [1] and had been led to believe</p>

<p>that the War Cabinet this morning would decide against immediate</p>

<p>action.</p>

<p>Now learn that while Cabinet divided, the Secretary of State for</p>

<p>Foreign Affairs [2] being the strongest opponent, the majority in</p>

<p>favour of proceeding immediately with stoppage of Narvik supplies</p>

<p>by action in Norwegian territorial waters and decision to this</p>

<p>effect may be taken tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>In my view the importance of such a decision cannot be exaggerated</p>

<p>and that it should be taken without fullest consultation with the</p>

<p>Dominions would be an outrage.</p>

<p>I have put this to the United Kingdom Government as strongly as I</p>

<p>can but in view of the fact that Winston Churchill [3] with</p>

<p>considerable support in Cabinet is fighting for an immediate</p>

<p>decision it is imperative that you support me. I suggest that you</p>

<p>cable the Prime Minister [4] immediately down the lines that in</p>

<p>view of the importance and possible repercussions of decision to</p>

<p>take action in Norwegian territorial waters to cut off German</p>

<p>supplies of iron ore you request that no decision should be taken</p>

<p>by the United Kingdom Cabinet before the Dominions have had an</p>

<p>opportunity to express their views and asking that you should be</p>

<p>fully informed of arguments in favour of such action, and should</p>

<p>be supplied with a summary of the appreciation of the General</p>

<p>Staff as to assistance that could be rendered to Norway and</p>

<p>particularly to Sweden in event of such action leading to an</p>

<p>attack by Germany on one or both of these countries. Imperative</p>

<p>that you cable immediately as the War Cabinet meets 11.30 a.m.</p>

<p>tomorrow (Friday).</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
