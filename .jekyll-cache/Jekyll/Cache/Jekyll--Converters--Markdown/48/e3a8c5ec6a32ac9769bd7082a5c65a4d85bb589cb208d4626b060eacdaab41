I"v<p>Cablegram unnumbered SS DOMINION MONARCH, 24 December 1948</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Please pass urgently to Hodgson. [1] Begins. How do you explain resolution which, as far as I can see, merely stabilizes position at a point which recognizes and provisionally confirms success of the Dutch aggression? I have asked you to report developments, but all I have are long and belated accounts of speeches without significant comment. What action do you now propose? Please reply immediately. Ends.</p>

<p>1 Heydon telephoned the message to Hodgson on 28 December.</p>
