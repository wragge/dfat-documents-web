The position is that the Dutch consider that joint report called for by the Security Council [3] means a joint enquiry and at present are definitely not prepared to allow any individual investigation by any member of consular enquiry and therefore will not permit aircraft to proceed to Djokjakarta or in the circumstances other places unless agreed to by members of the enquiry and the Dutch informed. No objection from Gani. In informal talks with the American and British Consuls-General, they agree that both individual and joint investigations most practical for joint report.</p>
