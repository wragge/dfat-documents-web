I"•<p>Cablegram unnumbered 4 March 1941,</p>

<p>Your cablegram of 26th February [1] suggesting creation of Council consisting of Minister or Ministers to meet periodically to discuss war questions affecting New Zealand and Australia, particularly in relation to Munitions, was considered by War Cabinet which feels that heavy demands at present made on Ministers preclude the formation of a Council such as that proposed and it is suggested that the present policy be continued under which continuous exchange of cablegrams on important subjects is effected, Delegations are appointed to deal with particular subjects as they arise, staff conversations are held as found necessary and the work of Liaison officers is continued.
