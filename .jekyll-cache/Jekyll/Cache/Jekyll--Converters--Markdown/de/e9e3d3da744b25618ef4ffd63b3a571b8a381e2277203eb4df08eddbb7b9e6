I"¯<p>Cablegram 238 20 April 1941,</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>With reference your M.38 of 1st April [1] please see my 239 of even date to Dominions Office. [2] Latham [3] has advised of report that 10 divisions concentrated in Formosa and 3 in Hainan and transports for whole force in readiness for attack on Singapore to synchronize with German bombing attack on Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Casey [4] also refers similar reports received in Washington. If joint declaration at present time could be arranged would therefore be most opportune.</p>
