I"Ý<p>Cablegram 239 LONDON, 3 July 1940, 11.50 a.m.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT SECRET</p>

<p>[On 30 June 1940 the U.K. Govt informed the Commonwealth Govt in</p>

<p>cablegram D299 that it proposed to issue a declaration that it</p>

<p>could not allow Syria or Lebanon to be occupied or used as a haven</p>

<p>by any hostile power and that it held itself free to take any</p>

<p>measures necessary in its own interest. On 1 July the Commonwealth</p>

<p>Govt dispatched cablegram 338 which read in part: â€˜Have you</p>

<p>considered possibility of French troops becoming actively hostile</p>

<p>to us with consequent military repercussions of a serious kind to</p>

<p>our numerically inferior forces in that zone? Is it impossible to</p>

<p>get joint declaration with Turkey to defend Syria?â€™ Both</p>

<p>cablegrams are on file AA: A981, War 45, iv.]</p>

<p>Before receipt of your telegram No. 338 of 1st July His Majestyâ€™s</p>

<p>Ambassador at Angora [1] had indicated that the Turkish Government</p>

<p>concurred in the draft of the declaration by the United Kingdom</p>

<p>Government and the declaration was thereupon issued at once.</p>

<p>Careful consideration had been given to the possible attitude of</p>

<p>the French troops in Syria. It is not expected in the present</p>

<p>circumstances they will become actively hostile to us. As regards</p>

<p>the suggestion in the last sentence of your telegram, although</p>

<p>Turkish co-operation in the defence of Syria and Lebanon might in</p>

<p>certain circumstances be welcome to us, the Arabs will inevitably</p>

<p>always be suspicious of the entry of Turkish forces into those</p>

<p>territories whatever the purpose. Turkey too would probably</p>

<p>require a reward for lending assistance. It was felt to be most</p>

<p>important therefore that nothing should be said now or later which</p>

<p>would give the slightest handle to propaganda that we had sought</p>

<p>to secure Turkish support for ourselves at the Arabsâ€™ expense. In</p>

<p>the circumstances it was thought to be better not to make an</p>

<p>approach to Turkey of the kind suggested in your telegram.</p>
