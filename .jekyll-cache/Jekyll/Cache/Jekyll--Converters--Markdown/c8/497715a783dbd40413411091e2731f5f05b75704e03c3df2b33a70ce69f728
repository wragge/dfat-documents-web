I"(	<p>Cablegram 584 CANBERRA, 5 September 1941</p>

<p>MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister. [1]</p>

<p>I desire to invite your attention to my predecessor’s cablegram No. 456 of 20th July [2] regarding the re-concentration of the Australian Imperial Force as a single force in one Corps and the relief of the 9th Division at Tobruk.</p>

<p>2. As intimated in cablegram No. 513 of 7th August [3], War Cabinet is pressing for effect to be given to these requests.</p>

<p>3. Your agreement with the principle of concentration was expressed in cablegram No. 556 of 9th August [4] and the Commander-in-Chief [5] had undertaken to see to this immediately on his return.</p>

<p>4. It is understood one infantry brigade and unnecessary base troops have been relieved and that intention was to move remainder during September when nights are longer. The G.O.C., A.I.F. [6], is however unable to give me assurances as to when these moves are to be completed. On the contrary he has submitted a proposal made to him that 9th Australian Divisional Artillery should relieve British artillery, together with statement which throws some doubt on possibility of the general relief of the garrison.</p>

<p>5. In view of decline in health resistance of troops and availability of fresher troops as mentioned in cablegram No. 513, I must reiterate request of my predecessor that directions be issued by you to Commander-in-Chief to give effect to our desires.</p>

<p>Parliament is meeting at the middle of the month and it is my desire to make a statement when withdrawal has been completed that re-concentration has been carried out. This is a vital national question here and should any catastrophe occur to Tobruk garrison through further decline and inability to withstand, a determined attack there would be grave repercussions.</p>

<p>6. I am confident of your fullest and immediate support in view of the assurances given in the first paragraph of your cablegram No.</p>
