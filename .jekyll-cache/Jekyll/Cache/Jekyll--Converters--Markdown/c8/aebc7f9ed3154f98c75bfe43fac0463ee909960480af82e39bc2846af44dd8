<p>2. Please keep in close touch with United Kingdom Embassy and endeavour to obtain their support also New Zealand for this protest, and also in F.E. C. discussion on Japanese whaling on Thursday next.</p>

<p>3. In F.E.C. follow lines indicated in paragraph 3 of our telegram under reference[3], and take strong attitude along lines of paragraph 1 above. We rely on you to obtain maximum support to ensure that there is (a) disapproval in principle of continuation by Japanese of whaling industry in Antarctica and in any event (b) approval of principle implied in Australian proposal viz. that Allies themselves be given all rights of operating any emergency expedition for purpose of obtaining oil and food to be allocated by F.E.C. or I.E.F.C. [4] or S.C.A.P., it being guaranteed that there will be strict observance of international whaling convention.</p>
