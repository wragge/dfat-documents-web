I"<p>British High Commission, Canberra, 24 June 1963</p>

<p>In my letter to you of 11th April about arrangements for Commonwealth passengers at ports of entry into Britain, <a href="#f1">1</a> I said that structural alterations were being made at London Airport so that no Commonwealth non-United Kingdom passengers would be required to queue with foreigners.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that these have been completed. The position is now that there are three queues for arrival passengers, one for Commonwealth non-United Kingdom passengers, one for United Kingdom passengers and a third for foreigners. Departing passengers are not segregated in the less busy periods, Commonwealth non-United Kingdom, United Kingdom and foreign passengers being all dealt with together. At busy periods Commonwealth non-United Kingdom passengers are dealt with separately from foreigners and United Kingdom passengers.</p>

<p>Commonwealth citizens are now therefore no longer required to queue with aliens.</p>
