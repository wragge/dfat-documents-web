<p>PERSONAL</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Bruce,</p>

<p>On Friday I received a letter informing me that the Secretary of State [1] was forwarding my name to the King for a C.M.G. [2] I ascertained that this was due to a recommendation by the Commonwealth Government and I naturally gladly accepted the proposal.</p>

<p>It was very kind of you to recommend for me this form of recognition for the services I may have been able to render to Australia and I am deeply appreciative of your kind regard.</p>

<p>I have already written to you another personal letter about myself [3] and I feel that you will quite understand my forwarding it by the same mail that carries this note to you.</p>

<p>I hope that you will understand that quite apart from recognition which is nice, and remuneration which is unfortunately essential, what I most appreciate is to be able to work under you as a member of your Empire team.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, F. L. MCDOUGALL</p>

<p>_1 Secretary for the Colonies and for Dominion Affairs, Leopold Amery.</p>

<p>2 Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.</p>

<p>3 Letter 45.</p>
