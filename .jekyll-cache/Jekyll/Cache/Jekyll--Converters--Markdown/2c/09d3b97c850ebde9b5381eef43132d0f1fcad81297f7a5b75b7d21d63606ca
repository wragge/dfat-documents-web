<p>1 The Select Committee had met on 15 August and 9 September. At the first meeting, Arek was elected chairman and, following an offer by Johnson, the Committee asked that a request be made to the Government for an executive officer who might assist the Committee in its work. It was thought â€˜highly desirable to have a man who would not be subject to pressures and could bring an independent mind to the workâ€™ (attachment to memorandum, Administration (Hay) to DOET, 15 August 1969, NAA: A4S2, 1969/4055). Territories had already asked Attorney-Generalâ€™s if it might provide a staff member on a temporary basis. In doing so, Ballard described the prospective officerâ€™s duties: â€˜The executive secretary would not be expected to press the Governmentâ€™s policies. This would be the responsibility of the official members. It would, however, be hoped that he would be able to steer the Committee away from unsuitable ideas put forward by outsiders. It would also be hoped that the executive secretary would not regard himself as simply an adviser on constitutions framed in vacuo but would make himself aware of developments in the economic and social fields so that he could stress the need for political development which has regard for social and economic developmentâ€™ (memorandum, DOET (Ballard) to AGâ€™s, 14 August 1969, ibid.). Attorney-Generalâ€™s nominated C.R. Morrison, the crown solicitor attached to the Snowy Mountains Authority. Morrison had worked as senior legal adviser in DOET, and in AGâ€™s had provided advice on Nauruan Affairs (telex 8436, DOET to Administration, 28 August 1969, ibid.). At the second meeting, the Committee appointed a subcommittee consisting of Arek, Johnson and Morrison to draw up the Committeeâ€™s program (memorandum, Administration (Hay) to DOET, I 0 September 1969, ibid.).</p>
