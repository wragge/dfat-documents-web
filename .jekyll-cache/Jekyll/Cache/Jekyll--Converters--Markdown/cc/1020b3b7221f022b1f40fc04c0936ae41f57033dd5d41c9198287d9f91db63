<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>MIDDLE EAST. Have just heard, though not yet confirmed, that air reinforcements which were being steadily sent to Middle East have been stopped. This due to the Prime Minister’s [1] obsession with problem of defence of these islands.</p>

<p>While appreciating the importance of this, do not consider that the retention of Middle Eastern air reinforcements could have marked effect here, while may be decisive in that theatre.</p>

<p>Am pressing strongly that flow to the Middle East should not be stopped. [2]</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>

<p>1 Winston S. Churchill.</p>

<p>2 On 27 September Bruce reported: ‘War Cabinet this morning decided scheduled reinforcements for October should be despatched notwithstanding strenuous efforts of Beaverbrook [U.K. Minister for Aircraft Production] that they should be retained here.’ See cablegram 855 on file AA:A1608, A41/1/1, xiii.</p>
