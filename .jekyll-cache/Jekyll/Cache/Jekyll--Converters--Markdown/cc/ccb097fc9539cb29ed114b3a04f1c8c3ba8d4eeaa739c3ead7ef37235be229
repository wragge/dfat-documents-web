I"C<p>Letter NEW DELHI, 13 March 1947</p>

<p>Sir Iven Mackay conveyed to me your message on February 24th and later sent me a copy of the statement you made to the House of Representatives on February 26th. I asked him then to convey to you my gratitude for your friendly approach and the sentiments you had expressed.</p>

<p>We are always agreeable to consultations between representatives of India and Australia in regard to matters of mutual concern.</p>

<p>India is deeply interested in the problems of the Pacific, economically, culturally and from the point of view of defence. I am sure that a discussion in regard to these and like problems will be helpful to us. As you know, we are at present passing through a rapid period of transition and have to face all the difficulties which accompany such periods. To these have to be added the complexities of post-war problems. We would therefore prefer to have the conference, as suggested, somewhat later when we are in a position to give more time or thought to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it may be worthwhile for you to suggest, in somewhat greater detail, the proposals which you would like to be discussed at such a conference, and to indicate, as far as is possible at this stage, the Australian view point in regard to them.</p>

<p>_</p>
