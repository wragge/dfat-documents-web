<p>881. Secret Priority</p>

<hr />

<p>Chinese Representation</p>

<p>Our 865,<a href="#f1">1</a> paragraph 4 refers.</p>

<p>If you think it might be useful, please discuss with the Americans following possible amendments to the AR. We do not want them however to be known as â€˜Australianâ€™ amendments.</p>

<p>(a) In the second preambular paragraph of the AR replace the words â€˜restoration of the lawful rightsâ€™ by the word â€˜representationâ€™,</p>

<p>(b) Replace the third preambular paragraph by the following:<br />
â€˜Accepting the representatives of the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China as representatives of China to the United Nations and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China as one of the five permanent members of the Security Councilâ€™,</p>

<p>(c) In the operative paragraph, replace the words after (under-line) â€˜decides toâ€™ by the following:<br />
â€˜accept the representatives of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China as representatives of China to the United Nations and in the Security Councilâ€™.</p>

<p>2. These amendments would, of course, be linked with an IQ variation or Nonâ€“Expulsion resolution. They are not the only possible amendments but indicate the sort of amendments which might achieve our objectives.</p>

<p>3. Our comments on the texts of the two American draft resolutions are contained in the following: our 767,<a href="#f2">2</a> submissions to Minister of 3rd August<a href="#f3">3</a> (paragraph 4) and 13th August<a href="#f4">4</a> (paragraph 11), our 845<a href="#f5">5</a>(paragraph 2 (C)) and our 865 (paragraph 2).</p>
