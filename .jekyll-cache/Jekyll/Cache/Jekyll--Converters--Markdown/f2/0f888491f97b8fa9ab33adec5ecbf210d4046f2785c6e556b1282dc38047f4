<p><strong>New political party<a href="#f1">1</a></strong></p>

<p>The following are some preliminary observations:â€”</p>

<p>(a) <em>Parliamentary support</em><br />
At first sight this is not repeat not impressive. This could be due to â€˜wait and seeâ€™ reaction from majority of members. It could also be due to the fact that partyâ€™s instigators Voutas and Holloway do not commend themselves to majority of older electorates and have tended to be treated with some scorn in the House. It is also true that older members have a suspicion of some of the younger executive members of the party outside the parliament such as Oala. The representatives from other areas such as the Sepik and the Highlands are not heavy weights. But other members will no doubt be thinking in terms of getting reâ€“elected next March and their attitude could well be conditioned by the likelihood or otherwise of membership of this party helping them in their own electorate. Lepani Watson says he has refused to join although invited. Position of Guise uncertain.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Representative character</em><br />
The party has succeeded in getting broadly representative character but only Yin Tobaining is regarded as a man of some substance. The remaining areas are not represented by persons who carry great weight locally. Indeed Nicholas Brokam will be in some danger in his own electorate of New Ireland.</p>

<p>(c) <em>Finances</em><br />
On Oalaâ€™s own admission money will be a considerable problem and this will limit the amount of party organising that can be done.</p>

<p>(d) <em>The programme</em><br />
This clearly is a compromise between a number of points of view. We know that some members have reservations on the question of public service salaries. But the overall strategy of the programme is toward moderation.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>2 On 24 June, Pangu released a statement accusing â€˜other political parties and a few individuals through the press as well as some officers of the PNG Administrationâ€™ of â€˜misrepresenting the Pangu objectives and platform in regard to self government and independenceâ€™. The statement said, inter alia, that Pangu wanted internal self-government to begin in 1968, meaning ministerial government; that PNG needed â€˜years of experienceâ€™ under self-government, with Australian assistance, before it would be ready for independence; that the party had not set a target date for independence; that Pangu supported a strong party system and did not want a one-party state; and that it was not anti-Australian and desired Australian help and a multi-racial society (telex 963, Hay to Canberra, 25 June 1967, NAA: A452, 1967/2735; for further development of the partyâ€™s platform, see submission, Ballard to Barnes, 6 September 1967, ibid.). Earlier in the same week, Barnes had commented publicly that â€˜the amount of publicity being given [Pangu] is out of all proportion to how it is regarded by the people of New Guinea. This is because the aims of the party fit in with the ideas of many people outside the countryâ€™. Barnes thought that the people wanted self-government, but not independence. Shortly after ward, during a visit to Lae, he added that â€˜Parties should form naturallyâ€™ and should not be â€˜force-fedâ€™. On the question of independence, Barnes said he â€˜stood byâ€™ his previous estimate that it could come in 20 years and he said that â€˜a seventh State would not be contemplated by the present Governmentâ€™, though he could not predict what â€˜in years to come â€¦ will be agreed between the Governments of Australia and Papuaâ€“New Guineaâ€™. The latter comments were characterised by the <em>Canberra Times</em> as â€˜demolish[ing] the main plank of the [new] conservative United Christian Democratic Partyâ€™ (Wolfers, â€˜Mayâ€“August 1967â€™, in Moore with Kooyman, <em>A Papua New Guinea political chronicle,</em> p. 18, and <em>Times Courier</em> , 24 June 1967, NAA: A1838, 936/5 part 6).</p>
