I"Ë<p>Extract LONDON, 2 January 1940</p>

<p>After we had dealt with the ordinary questions which arose, I</p>

<p>raised the question of the alteration in the instructions to</p>

<p>Lothian [1] with regard to his attitude towards the Zionists in</p>

<p>the United States of America. I pointed out that very definite</p>

<p>instructions had been sent to Lothian with which I was in full</p>

<p>accord, telling him that the British Government adhered entirely</p>

<p>to the White Paper, but that these instructions had been</p>

<p>countermanded by a cable dated Christmas Day which told him that a</p>

<p>decision as to the Governmentâ€™s policy would probably not be</p>

<p>arrived at for a period of a week.</p>

<p>I asked whether this portended a change in the Governmentâ€™s policy</p>

<p>and that if it meant any yielding to Jewish pressure to the</p>

<p>detriment of the Arabs, there would be the strongest objections</p>

<p>from Australia.</p>

<p>Anthony [2] was obviously slightly embarrassed that I had got on</p>

<p>to this point and gave a somewhat shuffling explanation to the</p>

<p>effect that when the matter had been discussed in the Cabinet some</p>

<p>members felt that the instructions sent to Lothian went rather</p>

<p>beyond the policy laid down in the White Paper. The point at issue</p>

<p>apparently being with regard to land sales. He told us that</p>

<p>Malcolm [3] had attended the War Cabinet and explained the</p>

<p>position and that the matter was still under consideration.</p>

<p>I reiterated my point that any selling of the Arabs under pressure</p>

<p>from the Jews would cause considerable trouble with Australia and</p>

<p>Anthony said that he would speak to the Foreign Office about the</p>

<p>matter.</p>

<p>I then raised the question of the Dominions Office letter [4]</p>

<p>dealing with the exchange of letters between Halifax [5] and</p>

<p>Benes. [6] I pointed out that what had been done appeared to me to</p>

<p>be a reversal of policy and that this was so was borne out by</p>

<p>Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s [7] telegram from Hungary specifically stating that a</p>

<p>change of policy had taken place.</p>

<p>I pointed out that the press section of the Foreign Office had</p>

<p>been very insistent a few weeks ago that there should be no</p>

<p>reference to Czecho-Slovakia, but that we should talk about</p>

<p>Bohemian and Moravian protectorates.</p>

<p>The statement in Halifaxâ€™s letter that His Majestyâ€™s Government</p>

<p>recognise that the Committee is qualified to represent the Czecho-</p>

<p>Slovak people appeared to be a reversal of the previous attitude.</p>

<p>Anthony clearly had little knowledge and no views on the matter</p>

<p>and it was left that he was to speak to the Foreign Office about</p>

<p>it.</p>

<p>We then had a discussion as to what attitude should be adopted by</p>

<p>the Dominions with regard to the Benes request for recognition of</p>

<p>his Committee by the Dominions. We decided the best course would</p>

<p>be that Benes should be told that the Dominion High Commissioners</p>

<p>would be prepared to see him and discuss the matter.</p>

<p>1 U.K. Ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>2 Anthony Eden, U.K. Dominions Secretary.</p>

<p>3 Malcolm MacDonald, U.K. Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>4 On file AA: A1608, B41/1/3, iii.</p>

<p>5 U.K. Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>6 Chairman of Czechoslovak National Committee.</p>

<p>7 U.K. Minister to Hungary.</p>
