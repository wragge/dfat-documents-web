<p>COMMITTEE 3 HUMAN RIGHTS 1. After the conclusion of the general debate the Committee decided (a) to examine only the draft declaration transmitted by ECOSOC with a view to preparing the text for adoption at this session of the Assembly, (b) not to exclude however an exposition of the views on other parts of the International Bill of Human Rights after completion of the declaration, and (c) not to exclude possible later decision regarding the connection between the declaration and the other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p>Great majority of the Committee agreed that this Assembly could do not more than complete the draft declaration. During the general debate, however, Australia stressed the importance of implementation and referred to its past proposals about the establishment of an international tribunal. We were responsible for the Committee decision on point (b) above so as to keep open the possibility of expressing further views on the implementation which might serve as a guide to the Commission on Human Rights. France was responsible for the inclusion of point (c) above.</p>
