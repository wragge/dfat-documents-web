<p>I have your letter of 22nd February [1] and sincerely appreciate the cordial relations between our Governments and your readiness to collaborate with Australia in Pacific problems.</p>

<p>I can assure you that the whole question of diplomatic representatives to Pacific nations is being most sympathetically examined by my Government.</p>

<p>The various aspects to which you refer will not be overlooked, and as soon as I am able to make a definite statement I shall advise you.</p>
