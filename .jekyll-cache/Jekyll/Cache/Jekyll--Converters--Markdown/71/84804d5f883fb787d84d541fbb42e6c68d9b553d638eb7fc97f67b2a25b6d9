<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Our 255. [1] Discussion will now take place on April 13th.</p>

<p>According to a letter [2] received this morning from Bajpai, it will deal with the present situation in Indonesia. He said this afternoon that no other subject will be discussed at this juncture. In addition to Nehru, the meeting will be attended by the heads of missions of those governments participating in the Indonesian conference last January, who are diplomatically represented in Delhi. On the assumption that you will approve, the High Commissioner and Kevin propose to attend. If you have any instructions, we should be glad to receive them.</p>

<p>(2) Bajpai is not very precise about the agenda. He says merely that the Governments concerned may desire to send additional instructions to their Representatives at the General Assembly. He also says that the meeting in Delhi might perhaps examine the question of imposing sanctions if a solution through United Nations should not be forthcoming.</p>
