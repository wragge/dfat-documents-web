<p>Personal</p>

<p>I am attaching with this letter a copy of the Cabinet minute which records the Prime Ministerâ€™s observations to his colleagues about his Common Market discussions during the recent visit to London and Washington.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p>One matter which arose in the course of the Cabinet meeting requires action.</p>

<p>The observation was offered, and accepted by the Cabinet as very likely to be accurate, that unless care is taken, Australia may find itself regarded as the â€˜leaderâ€™ within the Commonwealth in Common Market affairsâ€”i.e. other than Britain itself. This prospect arises from the attention which Australia has paid here, in London, in Brussels, and in Washington to the British-STET Six negotiations.</p>

<p>The Cabinet indicated that a development of this kind was not only not being sought, but would be regarded as containing definite risks, and in particular the risk of appearing to be leading or creating opposition to Britainâ€™s entry into Europe. Australia has, from the beginning, sought to act on reasonable and constructive lines as distinct from hostile or obstructive, and it was agreed that Australia must be on guard not to be manoeuvred, in fact or even in appearance, into any such role.</p>

<p>It was decided that a close watch should be kept for any unacceptable developments. In particular, it was agreed that our diplomatic and trade representatives in the Commonwealth countries should be asked to report upon any relevant developments, either official or public, and in due course to supply an appreciation of the reaction of the government of the country to which they are attached to the package of proposals being developed between the United Kingdom and the Six by September, and the extent, if any, to which that country may look to Australia to be the spearhead of opposition to the proposals.</p>
