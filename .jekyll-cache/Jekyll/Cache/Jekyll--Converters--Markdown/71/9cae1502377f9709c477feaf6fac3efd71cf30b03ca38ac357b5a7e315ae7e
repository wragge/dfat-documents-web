<p>RESTRICTED PRIORITY</p>

<p>Your 1185.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Reference your 2(a). Please inform State Department we had no thought of raising question of Colombo Plan in General Assembly. Your assumption regarding staff shortage and necessity to fit in with other scheduled meetings correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your 2(iii) (b) (i). Ambiguity in our 729[1] regretted. Our suggestion was intended to cover re-examination of needs of present members as well as consideration of position of non-participants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For your own information U.K. has now proposed to us that there should not be a meeting of Consultative Committee until the turn of the year but that in meantime C.L.C.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup> in London might be used for preparatory work of issuing new questionnaires, drawing up draft report, etc. This suggestion seems to have some merit. We do not know however whether U.S. reactions to this procedure were tested by British Embassy. It might not be wise to approach U.S. direct but you might discuss with British Embassy.</p>
