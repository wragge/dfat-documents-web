I"j<p>Letter BATAVIA, 24 February 1949</p>

<p>I have the honour to refer to your letter (PA 10/1240) [1] of 7th February concerning the supply of post-UNRRA relief goods for Indonesia from Australia.</p>

<p>I communicated to my Government the objection of the Government of Indonesia to the distribution of those supplies being supervised by a member of the Australian Military Observers Team and its suggestion that the supervision, if considered necessary, might be effected by the International Red Cross in co-operation with the Netherlands Red Cross, section Indonesia. My Government has now advised me that it is still desirous that the distribution be supervised but that it would prefer that this be carried out by the present representative in Indonesia of the United Nations International Childrenâ€™s Emergency Fund, Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan. From my conversation with Jhr. de Ranitz on Thursday 17th February, I understand that this nomination is likely to be agreeable to the Government of Indonesia and I should be grateful if you could confirm that it is so.</p>

<p>With regard to the suggestion that the Government of Indonesia should substitute textiles of a neutral colour from its own stocks for the blue and khaki textiles among the Australian supplies to the import of which it cannot at present agree, I have the honour to seek your advice as to the source and markings of the textiles it is proposed should be exchanged.</p>

<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Sir, the assurance of my high consideration.</p>
