I"h<p>Canberra, 11 August 1971</p>

<p>As you know, following the discussion I had with you and Mr Collings,<a href="#f1">1</a> I raised with the Prime Minister the question of control of Australia House and its possible transfer to the Department of Foreign Affairs. This was on 10 July.</p>

<p>The Prime Ministerâ€™s reaction was that we seemed to have assumed a prior policy decision on his part that this transfer should occur and that we were accordingly only concerning ourselves with mechanics.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>What he wanted to see was a paper setting out the pros and cons of transfer.</p>

<p>I said that I would talk again with you and the Chairman of the Board with a view to having such a paper prepared.</p>

<p>I should like to arrange this discussion for a time convenient to the three of us.</p>
