<p>2. The first example is deliberately ambiguous in its wording, and was included in case the PRC was not prepared to accept wording which more plainly met our legal point.</p>

<p>3. The rationale of the example is that â€˜have today decides upon . . . the establishment of diplomatic relationsâ€™ means on our view simply that the decision (underline one) to establish was taken â€˜todayâ€™ . with actual establishment necessarily corning later. In the case of â€˜mutual recognitionâ€™ . however, the decision requires no followâ€“up action and takes immediate effect.</p>
