<p>Canberra, 27 August 1965</p>

<p>Confidential</p>

<p>Atomic Intelligence</p>

<p>Timbs telephoned me from AAEC in Sydney, referring to our discussions several weeks ago.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I gathered from our necessarily guarded conversation that Timbs had had a discussion with a French engineer whom he described as competent and hard-headed. This French engineer had said: 
    1. the French had completed the plutonium re-processing plant in Israel;
    2. the Chinese were making materials available to Indonesia for the explosion of an atomic bomb.</li>
