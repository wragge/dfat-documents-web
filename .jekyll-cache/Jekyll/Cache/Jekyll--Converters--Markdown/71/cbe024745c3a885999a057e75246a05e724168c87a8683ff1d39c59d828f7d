<p>The whole of New Caledonia appreciates to the full the message you have addressed to it. [1] It thanks you for the sentiments you have expressed on the occasion of the temporary defeat of our Fatherland and of our firm resolve to co-operate with the French community throughout the whole world for the liberation of France, for which it has decided to continue the struggle by the side of the British Empire. In the present circumstances we should greatly appreciate it if the Commonwealth Government authorizes the departure of our four ships at present in Australia and which are bringing us supplies of food, especially the Neo-Hebridais with the cargo of flour.</p>
