<p>FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>Washington. In conversations with Casey [1] the only reference I made to him personally of the position was to say â€˜I was under the impression that you had in mind that he might be willing to go to Washington.â€™ From his remarks I greatly doubt if he would be, but this impression may be wrong, as I did not like to pursue the matter, feeling myself on somewhat delicate ground in view of the statement of your cable of 18th October.
