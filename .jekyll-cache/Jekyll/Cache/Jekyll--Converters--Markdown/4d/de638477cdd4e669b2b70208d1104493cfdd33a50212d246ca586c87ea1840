<p>IMPORTANT MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for the Prime Minister. My circular M.1[3]6 of 5th July</p>

<p>[1], my circular M. 140 of 9th July. [2]</p>

<p>JAPAN</p>

<p>In conversation with H.M. Ambassador [3] on 8th July, the United</p>

<p>States Under Secretary of State [4] indicated that he agreed as to</p>

<p>the probability of a Japanese move to secure bases in Indo-China</p>

<p>foreshadowed in my circular M.136.</p>

<p>2. On 10th July, Mr. Welles showed Lord Halifax a message from the</p>

<p>United States Ambassador at Tokyo [5] reporting that Matsuoka [6]</p>

<p>had disclaimed to him intention of attacking Russia, anyhow in the</p>

<p>near future. The United States Government had, however, received</p>

<p>information from Chungking source to the effect that on 6th July,</p>

<p>in return for German and Italian recognition of Japanese sphere of</p>

<p>interests in East Asia, Japan had undertaken to move south</p>

<p>immediately to commandeer bases in Indo-China and Thailand. There</p>

<p>would be later an attack on Siberia with special mention of</p>

<p>Vladivostock. This agreement had been approved by the Japanese</p>

<p>Imperial Council on 8th July.</p>

<p>The United States Government had further report from the Chinese</p>

<p>Ambassador at Berlin [7] that the Japanese move against Siberia</p>

<p>would be practically simultaneous with the southward move.</p>

<p>3. The United States Government had also information:</p>

<p>(a) that the Japanese Missions in Mexico and Central America had</p>

<p>been authorised to finance subversive activities there;</p>

<p>(b) that the Japanese Missions in North and South America had been</p>

<p>ordered to be prepared to destroy confidential files at a moment’s</p>

<p>notice.</p>

<p>4. Mr. Welles said that the United States Government would</p>

<p>announce shortly that the Panama Canal was closed for repairs.</p>

<p>Japanese ships therefore which had been ordered to make homeward</p>

<p>journeys between 14th July and 22nd July would be unable to do so.</p>

<p>Any British ships with material for Great Britain would of course</p>

<p>be allowed passage though this would not be announced.</p>

<p>5. Mr. Welles confirmed the definition of United States policy as</p>

<p>follows:</p>

<p>Until Japanese commit an overt act, the United States would make</p>

<p>no further communication of minatory kind. As soon as they did so,</p>

<p>the United States would impose embargo on all principal materials</p>

<p>wanted by the Japanese such as metals, cotton, lubricants (but</p>

<p>not) [8] necessarily on foodstuffs.</p>

<p>6. The United States would regard as overt acts any acquisition of</p>

<p>bases in Indo-China even if done in agreement with the Indo-</p>

<p>Chinese authorities since this would clearly in effect be under</p>

<p>German duress. The United States would judge acquisition of bases</p>

<p>in Thailand according to circumstances.</p>

<p>7. The United States would apply the same economic action in the</p>

<p>event of any overt action against Russia but not if the Japanese</p>

<p>merely denounced the Russian pact. [9]</p>

<p>8. In reply to an enquiry as to what the United States would do if</p>

<p>the Japanese gave warning of their intention to interrupt supplies</p>

<p>en route to Vladivostock, Mr. Welles said that the Japanese</p>

<p>Government would hardly impose a blockade against Vladivostock</p>

<p>without declaring war on Russia in which case the first step of</p>

<p>economic pressure would be applied. The next step would then be</p>

<p>considered.</p>
