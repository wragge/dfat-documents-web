<p>AGENDUM No. 107/1940 [1]-WAR CABINET PROCEDURE</p>

<p>The Prime Minister [2] stated that he had made a careful review of methods of procedure in order to ensure the vigorous prosecution of Australiaâ€™s war effort, that business is dealt with expeditiously, and that excessive demands are not made on the time of Ministers who carry heavy burdens of Departmental administration, and are also required to attend Full Cabinet and, in some cases, Economic Cabinet.</p>

<p>2. He pointed out that the War Cabinet business falls into the following two main divisions:-</p>

<p>(a) Major and general questions which are of equal concern to all Ministers;</p>

<p>(b) Other questions of a more specialised nature concerning particularly Departments and groups of Departments.</p>

<p>3. The following rules were approved:-</p>

<p>(iii) As a general rule other questions of a more specialised nature win be dealt with by groups of Ministers representing the Departments primarily concerned.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister will decide in any of these cases whether the recommendation of a group of Ministers should be submitted to War Cabinet or Full Cabinet for final decision.</p>

<p>(iv) Summaries of decisions of groups of Ministers will be circulated to all members of War Cabinet for information.</p>
