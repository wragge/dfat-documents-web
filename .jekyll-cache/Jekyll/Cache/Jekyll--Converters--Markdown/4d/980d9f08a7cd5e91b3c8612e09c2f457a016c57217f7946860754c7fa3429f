I"º<p>Cablegram 20 LONDON, 16 May 1944</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>For Minister for External Affairs from the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Reference your No. 88. [1]</p>

<p>There has been no sacrifice by me of Australiaâ€™s interests by endorsing a procedure which deprives her of an effective voice in anything concerning her interests.</p>

<p>2. As you will see from my separate cablegram to the Acting Prime Minister on the post-war world settlement [2], I reserved our views until the Government could be given an opportunity to consider the matter and specially emphasised that the procedure followed should permit of the results of the preliminary and informal discussions at Washington being the subject of further consultation between British Commonwealth Governments before any declaration is published.</p>
