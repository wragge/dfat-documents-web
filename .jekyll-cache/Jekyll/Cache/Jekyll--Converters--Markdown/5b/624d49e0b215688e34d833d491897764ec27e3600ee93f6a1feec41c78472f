<p>IMMEDIATE PERSONAL</p>

<p>Your telegram No. 64. [1]</p>

<p>I deeply appreciate the prompt and helpful decisions which you have taken. The further contributions now planned will be an immense help in the present critical situation. We will take these at once into our calculations. The magnificent efforts which now, as throughout the war, Australia is making in spite of her own needs will, I know, arouse the greatest admiration in this Country.</p>

<p>2. I am looking into the question of shipping and will telegraph further as to this and other points which arise. it would assist us greatly in our calculations if you could inform me at your earliest convenience of your decisions on the extraction rate (paragraphs 6 and 7 of my telegram No. 43 refer [2]).</p>
