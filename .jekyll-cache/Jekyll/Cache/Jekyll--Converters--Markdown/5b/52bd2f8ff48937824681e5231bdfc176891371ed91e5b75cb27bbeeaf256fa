<p>The Royal Netherlands Legation presents its compliments to the Department of External Affairs and has the honour to advise that the Legation has been instructed to convey the following to the Government of Australia.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that, to the regret of the Netherlands Government, it has been established that further discussions with the Republic of Indonesia, through the intermediary of the Committee of Good Offices, at the present stage, cannot produce results, the Netherlands Government desire to state that they have greatly appreciated the tireless efforts which the Members of the Committee of Good Offices individually and jointly have made to promote a settlement of the dispute.</p>
