<p>Your telegram No.80. [1]</p>

<p>I have seen Sjahrir since his return and got from him (and from Gani also) an assurance that they have not entered into negotiations or made arrangements with Campbell. I made all the points you mention. Sjahrir said he thought Campbell was ‘a sensible man’ and that the most important thing he had said was that Indonesian agents or representatives in Australia should be Indonesians and not Australians. I of course repeated that that was our strong view, but that Campbell had said things in Singapore that could not by any means be considered sensible.</p>

<p>Sjahrir agreed when I pointed out how action by Campbell could prejudice what we are trying to do. Apparently Campbell did give him his views as to the commercial situation, but he agreed quite readily that the only authentic information could come from us.</p>

<p>Sjahrir can be in no doubt as to how we feel and I do not think that he is trying to deal with Campbell on matters of substance behind our backs.</p>
