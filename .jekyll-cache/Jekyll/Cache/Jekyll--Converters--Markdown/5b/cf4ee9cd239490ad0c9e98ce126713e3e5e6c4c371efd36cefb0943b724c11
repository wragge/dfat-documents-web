<p>MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>1. We have considered position very carefully and we have noted statement by Foreign Secretary to Mr Beasley that the United Kingdom Government would not wish to interfere with any action by the Australian Government but would welcome any contribution we could make to peaceful solution. [1] We have considered carefully also your doubts about reference to Security Council. [2]</p>

<p>2. Australia is however in a most difficult position. This situation affects us vitally and we cannot remain inactive.</p>

<p>Moreover we have consistently upheld United Nations and consider that in this case we might place ourselves in untenable position if we refrained from raising matter at Security Council.</p>

<p>3. For these reasons, and because there seems no alternative action, we are disposed to draw the attention of the Security Council to the situation in Indonesia under Article 35 [3], and in doing so we are fully aware of and are prepared to meet any procedural objections likely to be raised.</p>

<p>4. We would however wish to proceed in this direction with your concurrence. In particular we would hope to have your support in having matter admitted to agenda and discussed by Security Council as a first step towards a peaceful solution of the problem.</p>

<p>Glad of your most immediate reply as it is becoming essential to state our intentions on this matter.</p>

<p>2 See Document 124 and Document 141, note 3.</p>

<p>3 Under Article 35 of the United Nations Charter, any member of the United Nations may bring any dispute, or situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, to the attention of the Security Council or the General Assembly.</p>
