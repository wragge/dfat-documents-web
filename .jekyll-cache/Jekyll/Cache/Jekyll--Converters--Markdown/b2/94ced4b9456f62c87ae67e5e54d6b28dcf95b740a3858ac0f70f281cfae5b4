I",<p>Letter MELBOURNE, 2 August 1944</p>

<p>It is very clear that Canada is not ready for the establishment of an Empire Scheme.</p>

<p>It is also clear that Canada, the United States and, in all probability, Russia are opposed to any plan for the internationalisation of air services.</p>

<p>The principles therefore stated in the Australian policy of.- (a) the internationalisation of air routes managed by some authority, and (b) an Empire service are negatived.</p>

<p>It would appear to me, therefore, that there should be immediate study given to the proposals set out in Lord Beaverbrook’s letter of the 3rd July [1] under which we can perhaps develop certain Commonwealth air services.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand should at once commence discussions regarding the operation of a route through the Mediterranean and India. In the latter connection, India would be welcome as a partner, but in any event the other three countries have paramount interests in providing a service between the Pacific and the United Kindom.</p>

<p>I should be glad if Mr. McVey would summarise his valuable reports [2] and the discussions [3] he has had by concluding with a series of positive recommendations as to the immediate steps that are desirable.</p>
