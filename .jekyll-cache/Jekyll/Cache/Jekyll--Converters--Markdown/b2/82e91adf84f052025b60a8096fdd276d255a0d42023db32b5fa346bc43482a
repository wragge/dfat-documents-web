<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>(7) General Officer Commanding Malaya [1] is forming a special staff under General Officer Commanding Fortress (Keith Simmons) to make final preparations for defence of Singapore Island.</p>

<p>(8) Keith Simmons reveals to me that all fixed defences Singapore Island are directed seawards. None are directed towards mainland.</p>

<p>His defence armament nevertheless appears strong but his garrison has been weakened by withdrawals to reinforce troops on mainland.</p>
