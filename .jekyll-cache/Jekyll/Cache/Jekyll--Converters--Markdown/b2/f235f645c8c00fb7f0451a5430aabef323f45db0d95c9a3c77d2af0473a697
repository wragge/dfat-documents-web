<p>Lisbon papers of 28 May report unilateral withdrawal of UDT from the coalition with FRETILIN. UDT communique detailing reasons for withdrawal, states that FRETILIN had systematically and scandalously disrespected the principles on which the coalition was based and had indulged in ideological and even physical aggression. It concluded that FRETILINâ€™s actions could seriously compromise the independence of Timor-Dili.</p>
