<p>IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>Indonesia I found at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning a more optimistic spirit than I have met for a long time.</p>

<p>2. It seems to be grounded on the hope that out of the plan drawn up by the several State Chief Ministers, and that prepared by Dr van Mook, something workable and acceptable to the Republic regarding the interim period may emerge.</p>

<p>3. For this reason I found keen anxiety that Committee of Good Offices should remain in being and that if possible Kirby should return to Batavia and work with new U.S. Member. Belief seemed to be that these two in co-operation might be the means of producing from the several plans, one acceptable to all parties.</p>
