<p>SECRET FOR PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>Developments of the last twenty-four hours are practically all recorded in Dominions Office cable [1] and press. Molotov [2] met the Ambassadorsâ€™ representations as to the Soviet-German agreement extremely unsatisfactorily accusing the British and French of lack of sincerity and refused information as to whether agreement would contain a clause determining the agreement in the event of aggression against a third party. Appears clear that the Soviet- German agreement not yet finalised but Berlin press reports anticipate it will be in forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Both the United Kingdom and French Ambassadors in close touch with Beck [3] on the question of negotiations.</p>

<p>Hitlerâ€™s [4] reception of the United Kingdom Ambassador frigid and Henderson now awaits written reply. Move by Hitler anticipated as soon as the Soviet-German agreement is signed.</p>

<p>Doubtful whether move will take the form of action of character which would leave the possibility of negotiation open or of so drastic a character as to preclude such a possibility.</p>

<p>In the latter event the effects of assistance by France and the United Kingdom to Poland so limited I have been urging on the United Kingdom Government the possibility of exploring every avenue to keep the door to negotiation open. I think a cable from you to the Prime Minister [5] stressing this would be of great value, particularly in view of your declaration today [6] which has greatly weighed here.</p>
