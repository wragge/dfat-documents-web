<p>Cablegram 344 WASHINGTON, 11 April 1945</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>My 246. [1]</p>

<p>The Brazilian Embassy at Washington confirmed in writing their readiness to establish diplomatic relations with Australia. The Brazilian Government has not yet given agreement for Macgregor but the Ambassador [2] insists that this is a routine matter and the delay is due to the absence of the President of Brazil from the capital. [3]</p>

<p>The Ambassador of Chile [4] has now left with me a written communication along the following lines- (a) Chile confirms the desire to establish diplomatic relations with Australia.</p>

<p>(b) Chile is prepared to grant immediately agreement for Macgregor.</p>

<p>(c) As Australia is accrediting Macgregor to Brazil and Chile â€˜with fixed residence in Rio de Janeiro, the Australian diplomatic mission in Santiago will in practice be left with a Charge dâ€™Affaires ad interimâ€™.</p>

<p>(d) As it is impracticable for Chile to reciprocate by accrediting a Minister to Australia and another country, Chile will designate a Charge dâ€™Affaires to Australia.</p>

<p>(e) Should Australia later decide â€˜as is to be desiredâ€™ to accredit a Minister to Chile â€˜with residence in Santiagoâ€™ Chile will immediately accredit a Minister to Australia.</p>

<p>With regard to paragraph (c) above, when approaching the Ambassador of Chile we did not make any reference to a fixed residence in Brazil. Presumably Chile has seen press notices or received a report from its Consular Representative in Australia stating that â€˜headquartersâ€™ of Australian Minister would be at Rio.</p>

<p>The Ambassador of Chile asked for confirmation that the appointment of a Charge dâ€™Affaires in Australia would satisfy the Australian Government. Please advise.</p>
