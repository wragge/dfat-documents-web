<p>IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET PERSONAL</p>

<p>You will have noted United Kingdom and United States comments on Count Bernadotte’s proposals for Palestine.</p>

<p>United Kingdom High Commissioner has now approached the Prime Minister in the following terms:</p>

<p>‘The United Kingdom government are anxious that all Governments who, having studied Count Bernadotte’s conclusions, find themselves in general agreement with them, should publicly express support for them. Such statements, besides increasing the chances that the conclusions will be rapidly and sympathetically considered by the Assembly, should serve to convince all parties in the Middle East that the majority of world opinion favours these conclusions, and should thereby help to influence both Arab and Jewish leaders towards acquiescence in any solution based on these conclusions which the United Nations may eventually adopt.</p>

<p>I have been asked to express the hope of the United Kingdom Government that, having studied Count Bernadotte’s conclusions, the Australian Government will find themselves sufficiently in agreement to feel able also to issue a supporting statement.’ Prime Minister would be glad to have your views as soon as possible.</p>
