I"ú<p>Cablegram 170 LONDON, 21 July 1944, 2.15 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Following personal for the Prime Minister from Lord Cranborne.</p>

<p>Begins.</p>

<p>Please see my telegram No. 169 [1] of to-day regarding Bretton Woods. I am sure you will agree that it would be most unfortunate if the Australian Delegation were alone to stand out from signature of the final Act. We understand that the final Act has been so drawn that the signature would not commit any Delegation to acceptance of the texts drawn up at the Conference and on this basis the position, both of the Commonwealth Government and of the Australian Delegation, would be fully safeguarded.</p>

<p>We greatly hope that in these circumstances you will feel able to send revised instructions to your Delegates. The matter is most urgent since the signature takes place to-morrow, Saturday.</p>

<p>1 Dispatched 21 July. On file AA:A989, 44/735/56/10, i.</p>
