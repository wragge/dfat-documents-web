I"Í<p>Cablegram 104 WASHINGTON, 30 May 1940, 1 a.m.</p>

<p>SECRET PERSONAL FOR THE PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>I do not know to what extent Bruce [1] enters Inner Councils in London but I feel very strongly that would be very much to general advantage if you were to insist that Bruce be made member of British War Cabinet.</p>

<p>[I would ride over] [2] any arguments regarding claims of Canada, etc. They could be similarly represented if they chose and if they have any individuals who could perform similar functions. Simple fact remains that Bruce has sense of reality which is badly needed and win be even more needed before this business is finished. [3]</p>
