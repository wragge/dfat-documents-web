<p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Your telegram 58 [1] was received after Security Council resolution. [2] Palarâ€™s charges of destruction of buildings in Djokjakarta are not borne out by the observations of military observers, Cutts or other deputies. There has been information that the Netherlands military authorities have moved administrative equipment (including office and radio equipment) and there has been much looting and destruction at night. A number of Republican officials in Djokjakarta are imprisoned or under house arrest as political prisoners. There are many Republican reports of maltreatment and intimidation.</p>

<p>2. I shall endeavour to have the request of the Chairman of the Council to the Commission for information on the damage to Djokjakarta interpreted broadly so as to cover if possible:</p>

<p>(a) Damage to and removal of facilities since 19th December;</p>

<p>(b) Facilities required for effective functioning of the Republican Government;</p>

<p>(c) Necessity of early action if Republican administration is to restore Djokjakarta.</p>

<p>3. Unfortunately, Cochran, this weekâ€™s Chairman, has taken an unannounced trip to Deda [sic] and Singapore with Lacy of the State Department, and will not be available before the afternoon of 25th March.</p>

<p>1 Dispatched on 23 March, it advised Critchley that he would receive the substance of Document 310 and asked him to cable direct to Hood in New York any information he had on Palarâ€™s charges that the Dutch were aiming to make it physically impossible to restore the republican administration in Djokjakarta.</p>

<p>2 See Document 312.</p>
