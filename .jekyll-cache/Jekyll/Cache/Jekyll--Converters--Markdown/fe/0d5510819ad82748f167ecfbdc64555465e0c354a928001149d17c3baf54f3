I"I<p>Cablegram 7 OTTAWA, 3 September 1939, 11.10 p.m.</p>

<p>My telegram No. 2 of 22nd January, 1935. [1]</p>

<p>1. His Majesty’s Government in Canada anticipating difficult problems that are likely to face members of Commonwealth as a result of conflict that has now begun, and being desirous of strengthening means of intercourse and co-operation existing between Canada and Australia, are of opinion that an exchange of High Commissioners between Ottawa and Canberra would contribute materially to that end. They therefore propose that [sic], should His Majesty’s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia agree, to designate a High Commissioner to Australia and to have him depart for Canberra at an early date. His Majesty’s Government in Canada would be glad to learn whether this proposal meets with your approval and wishes it to be known that they would welcome a similar appointment from Australia. As Parliament is to meet in Ottawa on Thursday of this week, and as it would be necessary to announce Government’s intention to make an appointment and introduce the necessary Estimates immediately after the opening, an early reply to this communication will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>2. As you are aware, South Africa and Ireland are already represented in this way at Ottawa, and the Canadian Government indicated in June of this year that they proposed to ask Parliament to make provision for reciprocal action.</p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>

<p>1 This cablegram was in fact sent on 11 January 1935. It suggested an exchange of High Commissioners between Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Government replied on 13 February 1935 that it had concluded that the time was inopportune for such an exchange.</p>

<p>Both cablegrams are on file AA: A461, A348/1/1.</p>
