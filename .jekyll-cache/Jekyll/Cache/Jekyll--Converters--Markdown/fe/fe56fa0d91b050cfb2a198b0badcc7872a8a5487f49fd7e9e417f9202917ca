<p>53. Secret</p>

<p>For Beale from Menzies.</p>

<p>I hope you will be able to see Dean Rusk as soon as possible after the inauguration.<a href="#f1">1</a> I realise of course that it may be difficult to get to him in the early days of the new Administration.</p>

<p>2. I would like you to take up with Rusk the following subjects with a view to both putting our point of view and to eliciting information on the likely trends in thinking of the Administration:â€”</p>

<p>[ <em>matter omitted</em> ]</p>

<p>(c) China, bearing in mind such issues as representation in the United Nations, the prospects of continuing the moratorium, the possibility of some disengagement from the off-shore islands. It is clearly essential that we should have as clear a lead as possible about United States thinking on this subject. I regard the Chinese problem as one of major importance in the coming year.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>1 On 12 January, Rusk had told the Foreign Relations Committee that the China question was â€˜a very complicated oneâ€™ which had not as yet been considered by the Administration. Rusk said that â€˜the presence in Mainland China of a large and powerful force is one of the facts of the world we cannot ignoreâ€™, though he added that he personally could â€™see no prospect at the present time that normal relations can be considered or established with Red Chinaâ€™.</p>

<p>2 Beale spoke to Rusk on 27 January but did not have time to discuss China. In a further talk on 4 February, China was again apparently omitted, and it was left for Menzies to raise the issue in Washington later in the month (see Document 90).</p>
