<p>Subject to certain reservations which need discussion and which are referred to in following cypher message our proposals at departmental level are as follows:â€”</p>

<p>(1) that Australia mount an exhibit either separately or in contiguity with similar exhibits by other Colombo Plan participants. We do not favour a combined exhibit.</p>

<p>(2) the size would be something over 1000 square feet.</p>

<p>(3) technique would be used of displaying a small range of goods demonstrating Australiaâ€™s manufacturing capacity and general industrial potential, to enliven a pictorial demonstration of Australian contribution to the Colombo Plan. The purely commercial aspects would not be emphasised.</p>

<p>The exhibit generally would be modest but we would not want to risk Australian prestige by a dull exhibit and we think the only way of avoiding this is to include some actual goods of commercial interest.</p>
