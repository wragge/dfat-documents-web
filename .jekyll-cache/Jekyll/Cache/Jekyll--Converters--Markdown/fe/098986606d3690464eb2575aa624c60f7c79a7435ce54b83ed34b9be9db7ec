<p>Your telegram 254. [1] Commonwealth Government decided on June 13th, 1940 against imposition of embargo on export of scrap iron [2] main reasons being (1) avoidance of further resentment in Japan following Yampi decision [3];</p>

<p>(2) export of any commodity is valuable at present for building up overseas credits;</p>

<p>(3) investigations show export of scrap not prejudicial to Australian interests and quantities available are in excess of current requirements.</p>

<p>Prohibition of export would lead to depreciation in price and injure Australian commercial interests.</p>
