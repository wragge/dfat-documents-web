<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram 12th November, No. 396. [1]</p>

<p>JAVA As stated in my telegram 25th October, No. 431 [2], the Allied Commander, Netherlands East Indies, and our political advisers to the Allied Commander, Netherlands East Indies, and the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia, have already been asked to do all they can to keep the Australian Political Representative in Batavia in touch and to facilitate his task in every way possible.</p>

<p>Your telegram is, however, being repeated to them, together with this reply, for their information, so that they may be fully aware of the Australian Governmentâ€™s strong interest in the situation in the Netherlands East Indies.</p>

<p>2. It is not our present intention that British representatives should become involved in negotiations. We wish to encourage negotiations between the Dutch and Indonesians and hope that a meeting with this object may take place on 15th November. We understand that Mr. Macmahon-Ball has already tentatively asked whether he could attend this meeting as an observer. We should have no objection, provided that Dr. van Mook agrees.</p>

<p>3. It will be appreciated that in the present phase, responsibility rests with the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia, who is responsible to the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff acting as agents for the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Dening is adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia, and Mr.</p>

<p>Walsh is adviser to the Allied Commander, Netherlands East Indies, who is responsible to the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia. While there is no objection to the Australian representative communicating the Australian Governmentâ€™s views direct to our authorities on the spot, it will be appreciated that the latter can only act within the scope of instructions they receive from those to whom they are responsible. On this understanding we feel that there will be advantage in closest contact between your representatives and ours.</p>
