<p>Your report of 23rd June and telegrams 2300 and 2316 on Sterling Balances. [1]</p>

<p>1. I agree that Rowe-Dutton proposals are not acceptable even as basis for discussion. Australian Government appreciates United kingdom difficulties and is prepared to be reasonable but cannot agree to being pushed around.</p>

<p>2. As I told Dalton if United Kingdom unable to concede agreement satisfactory to us they must act unilaterally.</p>

<p>3. Any arrangement agreed to by Australia must have sufficient flexibility to preserve Australiaâ€™s independence in control of its balance of payments and trade policy. We would, of course, be reasonable and take account of U.K. position.</p>

<p>4. Your outline proposals provide a satisfactory basis for negotiation on foregoing principles.</p>

<p>5. Immediately following telegram gives detailed comments from Treasury and Bank.</p>
