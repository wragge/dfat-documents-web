<p>Your telegram No. 69 18th July, Secret. [1] Timor Oil Concessions.</p>

<p>Wittouck [2] is now in London and is requesting the support of His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom on behalf of Asia Investments Company which he claims is a British Company registered in Hong Kong. He states that under Portuguese law rights vested in this Company cover the entire oil rights of Timor with the exception of Staughton concessions [3] previously granted, that through Abbott, Tout and Creer, Solicitors, Sydney, the Company has[4] Timor Oil Limited aforementioned Staughton concessions and that his Companyâ€™s concessions therefore cover complete oil rights of Portuguese Timor. He has informed the Portuguese Government and His Majestyâ€™s Ambassador at Lisbon [5] that he actually represents Australian interests but in a letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [6] he merely states â€˜he is fully conversant with the wishes of the Australian Government.â€™ Wittouck states that the Portuguese Government made it clear to him that they â€˜could not treat with him as regards concessions desired by Australiaâ€™ in the absence of confirmation of the statement that he represented â€˜the Australian interestsâ€™. He informed His Majestyâ€™s Ambassador that interested parties in Australia had handed over their interests to him and that he was prepared to produce correspondence.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs feels that it is advisable, before considering reply to Wittouckâ€™s request for interview or action in the sense desired in your telegram No. 69, to ascertain from you how much credence should be extended to Wittouckâ€™s statement and whether the Australian Companies mentioned in your telegram have a better claim to support than such Australian interests as Mr Wittouck may be found on investigation to be formally empowered to represent.</p>

<p>As Mr Wittouck is pressing for an interview before 31st July I should be grateful for an early reply to this telegram.</p>
