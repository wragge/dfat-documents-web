<p>Your telegram No. 13. [1] You will now have had Dominions Office circular telegram No. 75 [2] of 23rd March giving fully the provisional terms of Prime Ministerâ€™s statement. Passage in telegram No.73 [3] which you queried was badly drafted. Obligation number 2 does not mean an obligation to Czechoslovakia. It is intended to refer to obligation of United Kingdom Government to France under treaty of Locarno which might arise as a result of possible attack on Czechoslovakia.</p>
