<p>IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED</p>

<p>Indonesia It was announced on the air that meeting has adjourned and that Egypt and others will not support United States Resolution [1] as it does not go far enough.</p>

<p>I have discussed position with the Minister and his main concern as previous telegram [2] indicated is to secure a positive vote.</p>

<p>If there now appears to be support for Delhi resolution [3] the further you can go towards it with the hope of a positive vote the better.</p>

<p>Much will depend on how far the United States is prepared to move towards Delhi resolution.</p>

<p>The important thing is not to show any weakening on the Delhi resolution to which, already, according to press reports, American public opinion is reacting favourably.</p>
