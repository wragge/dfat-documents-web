I"<p>Letter 25 October 1938,</p>

<p>PERSONAL</p>

<p>I have your personal and secret letter of 7th October [1] in which you gave me a historical resume of the events leading up to the recent European crisis, and the happenings during the critical September weeks. Naturally I have read your account with the greatest interest; in fact I had hoped that you would get an opportunity to give me your observations from the centre of activities and so fill in few spaces in the material received from other sources. We are all very grateful indeed for the part you played, and I particularly appreciated your keeping me advised of developments. I shall of course keep your letter confidential, and look forward to the time when we can have a personal chat on this important matter and many others.</p>

<p>I know you must have worked under severe strain and trust that you are now able to take things a little more easily.</p>
