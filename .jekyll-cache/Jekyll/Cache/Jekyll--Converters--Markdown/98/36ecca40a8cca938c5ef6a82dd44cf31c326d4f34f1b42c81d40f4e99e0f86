I"š<p>Cablegram unnumbered 8 January 1940,</p>

<p>Your telegram 20th December. [1] Production of Foodstuffs War Time</p>

<p>and Post-War requirements. The circumstances stated in your</p>

<p>telegram under heading War Situation is [sic] certainly of</p>

<p>interest to Australia, and we wish you to continue to explore on</p>

<p>lines you indicated and advise as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Dairy Produce and Pig Meat are especially capable of quick</p>

<p>expansion.</p>

<p>Regarding post-war position we have fear serious problem would be</p>

<p>involved if we were to stimulate production to meet war time</p>

<p>requirements without an assurance of adequate post-war markets.</p>

<p>Whole matter will be considered by Agricultural Council next month</p>

<p>when we would like to give them some idea (general perhaps at this</p>

<p>stage) as to how we would safeguard the future should we expand</p>

<p>production to meet war time requirements.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 On file AA: A1608, A37/1/4, i. Bruce reported that he was</p>

<p>alarmed at the lack of co-ordination between the U.K. departments</p>

<p>responsible for food, agriculture and shipping. He had urged an</p>

<p>immediate survey of U.K. and French commodity needs in the war</p>

<p>situation and of how these needs could be met from U.K., Dominion</p>

<p>and neutral sources. In regard to the postwar situation Bruce did</p>

<p>not consider the U.K. Govt could at that stage make any commitment</p>

<p>because the announcement of any future increase in Imperial</p>

<p>Preference would strengthen the German position in Scandinavia and</p>

<p>have most unfortunate repercussions in the United States.</p>

<p>Furthermore the United Kingdom would insist on reciprocal</p>

<p>preference; which would be difficult to contemplate in view of the</p>

<p>increase of Australiaâ€™s secondary industries. Bruce nevertheless</p>

<p>believed that if agreement could be reached as to the directions</p>

<p>in which Australia should expand her wartime production some</p>

<p>arrangement reasonably safeguarding the future could be arrived</p>

<p>at.</p>
