<p>SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Begins-I greatly appreciated your helpful message of June 15th on the subject of the Franco-Italian relations. [1] It is most useful to know from time to time how the position strikes you. The views which you expressed agree very closely with our own. Indeed we have been taking every suitable opportunity to impress upon the French Ministers the advisability of some step which might lead to negotiations on outstanding Franco-Italian questions, but so far, I am sorry to say, we have met with no success. Recently I considered whether it might not be desirable again to raise the matter, but our Ambassador at Paris [2] has advised that the present moment is not propitious for such a step. We shall, however, continue to bear the matter in mind and possibly when the position as to negotiations with Russia is clear it might be feasible to take some such action.</p>

<p>Very best wishes and thanks. [3]</p>
