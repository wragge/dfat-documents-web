<p>SECRET</p>

<p>1. Session on Indonesia concluded this afternoon.</p>

<p>Results- (A) Chinese Resolution carried requesting the Committee to give particular attention to political developments in West Java and Madura and to report thereon at frequent intervals. [1]</p>

<p>(B) Canadian Resolution carried in form previously telegraphed.</p>

<p>[2]</p>

<p>(C) Australian amendment [3] not put but statements made clearly showing Committee may act as suggested by me. The President was particularly strong and Van Kleffensâ€™ protest clearly ineffectual.</p>

<p>(D) Colombian amendment [4] lost.</p>

<p>2. I think the debate and results very satisfactory particularly (A) and (C) of paragraph 1. Once (C) was achieved Colombian amendment did not matter. 3. I am returning via London and Singapore so that I can see Critchley at Singapore. I leave London Tuesday second March and arrive Singapore midday Thursday leaving early Friday morning.</p>

<p>Would appreciate Critchley meet me Singapore so that we may confer Thursday.</p>

<p>4. Should arrive Sydney Saturday 6th March.</p>

<p>Please inform family.</p>
