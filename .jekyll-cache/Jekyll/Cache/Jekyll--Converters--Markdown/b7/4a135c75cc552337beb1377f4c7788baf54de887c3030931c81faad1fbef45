<p>3 On 2 March Curtin instructed Bruce (cablegram 1817) to ask the Swiss authorities to inform the Thai Govt that the Commonwealth Govt had declared the existence of a state of war with Thailand as from that day. On 1 April in cablegram B35, however, the External Affairs Officer in London, A. T. Stirling, reported that the Thai Govt had refused to take cognizance of the declaration because there had never been any cause for hostility between Thailand and Australia.
