<p>China</p>

<p>In an article written for the FER<a href="#f1">1</a> (and reprinted in The Bulletin of 1 July), Mr Whitlam stated â€˜I choose Peking as the government of China, of which Taiwan is a provinceâ€™ .</p>

<p>2. If this accurately reflects ALP policy and the position Labor will take if and when in office, the Canadian formula (which hitherto the ALP has espoused) will be irrelevant.</p>

<p>3. I believe the FER article appeared some weeks after Mr Bowenâ€™s statement of 9 May.<a href="#f2">2</a> It could be, therefore, thatâ€”oh irony of ironiesâ€”Mr Whitlam was prompted to make his (novel) statement by the Ministerâ€™s assertion that the PRC was requiring acknowledgement of PRC sovereignty over Taiwan, not just acknowledgement of the PRCâ€™s claim, as a condition for establishing diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>4. It may be, of course, that Mr Whitlamâ€™s statement was not calculated but was rather a slip of his (or Fitzgeraldâ€™s)<a href="#f3">3</a> pen. But even if so, it will now be very difficult for a Labor Government to persuade the PRC to accept the Canadian formula.</p>

<p>2 The text of the statement is given in <em>Current Notes,</em> vol. 43, 1972, pp. 189â€“201. In relation to the PRC Bowen stated: â€˜Australiaâ€™s position is that we are willing to â€œrecogniseâ€ the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and to exchange diplomatic representatives in accordance with normal international practice. In normal international practice, by extending recognition and establishing diplomatic relations neither party is requiredâ€”or to be assumedâ€”to approve or disapprove the policies of the other; neither party is requiredâ€”or to be assumedâ€”to pass judgment upon disputed territorial claims of the other party. But, as we understand it, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China insists as a condition of establishing diplomatic relations that we acknowledge it as the sole legal government of China and as having sovereignty over Taiwan â€¦ In view of our longâ€“standing relations with the Government on Taiwan â€¦ Australia is naturally and quite properly reluctant and indeed unwilling to submit to Pekingâ€™s stipulation that it should abandon its friendâ€™ .</p>
