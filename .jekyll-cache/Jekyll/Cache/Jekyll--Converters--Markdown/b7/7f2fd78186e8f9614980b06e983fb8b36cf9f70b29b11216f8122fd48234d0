<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>For Evatt Your 789. [1]</p>

<p>Australia has neither aircraft nor organisation which enable it to act independently. It is therefore my view that it would be unwise to decline United States invitation [2] to hold exploratory talks on postwar international aviation. I propose to raise matter on my return with the object of sending Minister for Civil Aviation and adviser to have preliminary discussions with American authorities.</p>

<p>Australian viewpoint could then be clearly set out and possibly Americans induced to modify attitude.</p>
