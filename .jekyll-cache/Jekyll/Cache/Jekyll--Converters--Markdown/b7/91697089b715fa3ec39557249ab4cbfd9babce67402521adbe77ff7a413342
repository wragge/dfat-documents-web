<p>Bajpai states India has already instructed their United Nations Representative [2] to prepare for informal conference.</p>

<p>India feels it would be desirable to discuss at this conference addition of Indonesia to Assembly agenda. He feels also that India or Australia or both should take the initiative to have Indonesia placed on Assembly agenda, but he thinks that it might preferably be India seeing that they had convened the Indonesian Conference at New Delhi.</p>
