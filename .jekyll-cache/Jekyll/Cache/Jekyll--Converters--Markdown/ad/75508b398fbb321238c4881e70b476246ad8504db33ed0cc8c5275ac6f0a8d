<p>TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Senator Armstrong[1] has suggested that he should take opportunity while in United States to have discussions with Forrestal[2] on question of security of information and U.S. attitude. He is very concerned about the position as it appears from London.</p>

<p>2. I myself am even more worried than when I cabled you in London on this matter (my 38 to Crotonate).[3] Reports have appeared in U.S. press of controversy in Australia over CSIR and secrecy of research, including references to talks by you in London.[4] In spite of excellent statement by Mr. Dedman on 29th July I fear publicity may have further alarmed U.S. authorities. In any event there is no indication in Washington of any modification in attitude towards our Service representatives.</p>

<p>3. It would be most helpful if you could let me know the results of any discussion you may have had in London, and any facts which might tend to reassure U.S.</p>

<p>_[1] Senator J.I. Armstrong, Minister for Supply and Development.</p>

<p>[2] James Forrestal, US Secretary of Defense. Resigned March 1949.</p>
