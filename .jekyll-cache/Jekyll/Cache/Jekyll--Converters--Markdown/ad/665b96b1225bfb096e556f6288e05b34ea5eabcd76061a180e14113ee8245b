<p>O.CH178170 RESTRICTED PRIORITY</p>

<p><strong>Portuguese Timor</strong></p>

<p>An AAP report of 20 February from Jakarta states that Fretilin and UDT have called for â€˜an immediate proclamationâ€™ of the territoryâ€™s independence. The report states that â€˜the call was made through Timor Governor Lemos Piresâ€™. This suggests that Pires might have conveyed the UDT-Fretilin case to the Portuguese authorities in Lisbon during his recent visit.</p>

<p><em>For Lisbon (Cooper)</em></p>

<p>The clear implication of this report is that UDT and Fretilin are pressing for a handover of power without recourse to self-determination. We should like Cooper to call as soon as possible on the Portuguese (preferably at Ministerial level) and stress the importance Australia attaches to a measured and deliberate process of decolonisation in Timor through arrangements leading to an internationally acceptable act of self-determination. You might also invite the attention of the Portuguese to the harmful effects the reported statement by Fretilin and UDT might have on Indonesian attitudes.

<p><em>For Jakarta</em></p>

<p>Taylor should refer to this report in the course of his discussions with the Governor, also making the point that we strongly support a measured and deliberate approach to decolonisation, which should culminate in an internationally acceptable act of self-determination.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>
