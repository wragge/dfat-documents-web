<p>IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>INDONESIA</p>

<p>Your telegram 4962. [1] Attlee and Bevin discussed Indonesian situation this morning and Bevin has asked that the Australian Government be informed that he favours immediate resolution calling for cease-fire, withdrawal of Dutch troops and resumption of work of Committee of Good Offices.</p>

<p>2. The United Kingdom have not yet formulated any resolution but may support United States resolution although they have not up till this afternoon been informed of the contents of any American draft resolution.</p>

<p>3. Bevin is very angry at Dutch and opinion among Ministers and Officials here is summed up in one comment that â€˜Dutch seem determined to drive republicans underground from where they will re-emerge with fully trained Communist leadersâ€™.</p>

<p>4. The United Kingdom however are clearly chary of action under article 41 of the charter at the moment.</p>

<p>5. I have informed this briefly to the Minister and assume that you are reporting fully to him the instructions you are giving to Hodgson.</p>
