<p>3. Palar informs us that the Dutch in East Java are preventing the Republicans from making propaganda in anticipation of plebiscites and that the Dutch propose that plebiscites should be held throughout Java, Sumatra and Madura, (i.e. including present Republican-controlled territory.) Palar hinted that Dr. Grahamâ€™s successor has disappointed the Republicans and implied that American activities are contributing to a feeling of desperation among the leaders of the Republic.</p>
