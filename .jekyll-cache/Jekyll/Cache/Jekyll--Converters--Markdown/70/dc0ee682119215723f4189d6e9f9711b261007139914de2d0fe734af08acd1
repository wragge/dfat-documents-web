I"z<p>Cablegram 360 [1] LONDON, 27 August 1939</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Cabinet did not meet till 3.30 and sat till 6 and adjourned till tomorrow morning. Henderson’s [2] return postponed till tomorrow afternoon. This decision deliberately arrived at, and for your information and MOST CONFIDENTIAL this due to influences moving both in Berlin and Rome which desirable should have time to work before United Kingdom reply received. Draft reply continued today, and I gather Cabinet united on general lines which from my information appear satisfactory.</p>

<p>Your cable most helpful.</p>
