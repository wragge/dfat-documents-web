I"ª<p>Cablegram unnumbered TOKYO, 4 July 1940, 8 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Following from Hard [1]</p>

<p>I was present at an Embassy Conference at which information was</p>

<p>given that the Young Army group are getting out of hand and will</p>

<p>precipitate direct action on the least pretext. Decided change was</p>

<p>thought to be imminent on Manchukuo Emperorâ€™s [2] departure over</p>

<p>the week-end, new Cabinet probably containing Shiratori as Foreign</p>

<p>Minister and involving extreme likelihood of Axis link up and</p>

<p>giving the militant party an impetus to carry on pre-arranged</p>

<p>plan. If an unfavourable proposal is submitted regarding the</p>

<p>Burmese Road, direct action will result, particularly in view of</p>

<p>the publicity given to the American announcement of inability to</p>

<p>prevent Japanese aggression in the Pacific. The Ambassador</p>

<p>suggests that I submit that Australiaâ€™s influence on home [i.e.</p>

<p>U.K.] Government would be appreciated to enable conciliation</p>

<p>measures for the removal of this pretext for aggression. Though</p>

<p>unwilling to commit herself on behalf of the general British</p>

<p>interests is there any likelihood of America rendering assistance</p>

<p>to Australia.</p>

<p>1 Assistant Australian Government Commissioner in Japan.</p>
