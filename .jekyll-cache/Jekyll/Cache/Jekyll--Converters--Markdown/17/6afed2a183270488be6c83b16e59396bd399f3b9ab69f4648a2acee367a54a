<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>Your UN.737. [1]Your general approach is wholly consistent with the approach we have been advancing with other missions overseas and with overseas representatives here, and the suggestion in your paragraph 6 is the type of compromise for which we have been working. There is nothing inconsistent with joint American- Australian arbitration on the one hand and small commission of three or four whose duty it would be to observe the carrying out, not only of the ‘cease fire’ order, but also the decisions arrived at after arbitration. I am sure this would be acceptable to Indonesians, but a lot will depend on your relationship with Sjahrir.</p>
