<p>We had assumed in the absence of any comments from you on our telegram D.1102 of 14th [December] [2] and our further telegram D.28 6th January [3] repeating reply sent to Canadian Government that you had not dissented from our view that we should accept proposal for preliminary exchange of views between parties to Moscow declaration.
