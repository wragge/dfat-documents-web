I"+<p>Cablegram [83] [1] WASHINGTON, 12 May 1940, 10.19 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>State Department information this afternoon is to the effect that there is less cause for anxiety than I indicated in my preceding unnumbered telegram. [2] Cables from British Ambassador, Tokyo [3], seem to confirm this.</p>

<p>In view of statements which I understand United Kingdom and Netherlands Governments have made today that there is no intention of Allied intervention in the Netherlands East Indies, I understand United States Government is inviting the Japanese Government to agree with them that there is no menace to the status quo in the Netherlands East Indies and that no action is called for by Japanese or United States Governments.</p>
