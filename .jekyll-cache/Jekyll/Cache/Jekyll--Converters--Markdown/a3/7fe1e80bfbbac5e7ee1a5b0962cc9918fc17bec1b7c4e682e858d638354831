  <li>
    <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think you should plan to remain in Colombo several days for finalisation of your report and pending decision on the following suggestion, which is put to you for comment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In three or four weeksâ€™ time it may be necessary for you to remain in Singapore pending the appointment of an Australian Commissioner. At some stage we think it would be valuable for you to visit New Delhi and Karachi to discuss types of technical aid we might provide other than aid by way of individual fellowships, special training schools and the sending of experts to the area. In particular, we would like you to discuss:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(a) provision by Australia of general technical and school libraries:</p>

<p>(b) equipment for scientific educational training, e.g. in polytechnics, laboratories, agricultural research institutions;</p>

<p>(c) possibilities of Australian grants in aid to appropriate institutions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What we need are specific and detailed descriptions of equipment required for projects that have been definitely planned or are likely to be set underway and of priority given to them by the Government. It seems probable that about Â£300,000 might be made available In current financial year for desirable projects of the above type. We could consider providing actual equipment, if available here or in sott currency area, or even cash grants subject to clearly defined conditions as to their use within the scope of technical assistance. There would be a number of other factors to be examined before final decisions were made, but we feel the need for a preliminary survey in the capitals concerned. Preliminary enquiries have already been commenced through our mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to us that you might make this survey by proceeding direct from Colombo, returning to Singapore in two or three weeks. There would then be no objection to visiting Djakarta, provided you keep the discussion confined to the Colombo Plan and economic relations. It would be especially valuable to have discussions with the United States Missions in Djakarta since they may have ideas as to useful forms of assistance from Australia. We would have to decide later whether Australia would extend its assistance to Indonesia beyond present levels pending her formal entry into the Technical Assistance Programme.</p>
