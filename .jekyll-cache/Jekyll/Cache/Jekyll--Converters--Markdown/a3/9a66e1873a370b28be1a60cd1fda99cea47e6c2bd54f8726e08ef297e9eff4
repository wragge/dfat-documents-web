<p>18. SECRET IMMEDIATE</p>

<p>[ <em>matter omitted</em> ]</p>

<p>4. The afternoon session was given over to some discursive debate on economic conditions in various countries beginning with statement by Ceylon Finance Minister Jayewardene<a href="#f1">1</a> setting forth Ceylonâ€™s economic needs and introducing a resolution for a ten year plan for economic development of backward countries in South East Asia. This will probably be considered further when the conference discusses South East Asia together with proposals which I am proposing to submit to form a basis for economic assistance to South East Asia. We have prepared a paper setting forth our proposals and will be circulating it to the conference today.</p>

<p>5. These proposals, which have been discussed with the United Kingdom, will recommend the Government to examine the possibility of affording tangible aid direct and by giving a high priority to South East Asian needs in the operation of international organisations. I am stressing that the main tactical objective is to show a genuine willingness to meet the serious drift in the political and economic situation in South East Asia, as a basis for an immediate approach to United States with a view to enlisting their active participation.</p>

<p>6. I am proposing with the support of the United Kingdom that a consultative committee should be established, possibly in Canberra to consider reactions of the Government and co-ordinate tangible programmes.</p>

<p>7. I have already informed the United States Ambassador in Ceylon<a href="#f2">2</a> of the general lines of our thinking and think that our Embassy in Washington should be informed briefly of the contents of paragraphs 4 to 7 of thisâ€¦<a href="#f3">3</a></p>
