<p>PERSONAL FOR BRUCE FROM EVATT</p>

<p>Your S.40. [1]</p>

<p>General principles of world organization will be discussed in Wellington with Fraser next week and it is hoped as a result of these talks to communicate to United Kingdom preliminary views on Dumbarton Oaks draft. Any further information which would assist Wellington talks would be appreciated.</p>

<p>2. In the meantime I note the personal view you gave to Cadogan in favour of taking interim measures to ensure security against Germany and Japan and perhaps to defer more ambitious projects.</p>

<p>However, the value of the new world organization will be in promotion of stability and general welfare as well as handling threats to peace. Any limitation on its functions in respect of security might, of course, limit every phase of international co- operation.</p>

<p>3. In all these great matters Australiaâ€™s part should be recognised and when the first council is established we should have a place upon it. I am sure you will always be active with this end in view.</p>
