<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET</p>

<p>SCANDINAVIA. Long meeting last night with the Prime Minister [1] and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [2], when the whole question exhaustively examined. Am confident as a result Narvik action will be dropped and consequently the review foreshadowed my telegram No. 63 [3] will not be forthcoming.</p>

<p>At the meeting was agreed that stoppage of supplies of iron ore to Germany would be a major war objective but that no really effective action could be taken without the co-operation of Sweden.</p>

<p>Position will be watched with a view to being prepared to act immediately should favourable opportunity occur and in the meantime the Chiefs of Staff are collaborating with regard to necessary plans and preparations.</p>
