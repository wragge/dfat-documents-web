I"*<p>Cablegram unnumbered 12 August 1940,</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>Your telegram of 5th August [1] received. Commonwealth Government is grateful for invitation of New Zealand Government to be associated in Mission you propose to send to Tahiti.</p>

<p>Certain obligations with regard to New Hebrides and New Caledonia have already been entered into by Commonwealth, which has assured New Caledonia of its active support and co-operation particularly in the economic sphere. Mr. B. C. Ballard has been appointed our representative in New Caledonia.</p>

<p>It is felt, however, that Tahiti clearly comes within the naval and economic sphere of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Therefore the Commonwealth Government, whilst sympathetic towards the proposed Mission, considers that representation should be limited properly to New Zealand. [2]</p>
