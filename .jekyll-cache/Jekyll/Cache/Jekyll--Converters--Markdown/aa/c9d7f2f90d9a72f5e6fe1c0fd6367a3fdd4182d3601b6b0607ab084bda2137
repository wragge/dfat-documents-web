I"<p>6th May 1926</p>

<p>My dear P.M.,</p>

<p>I write to thank you for your personal handwritten letter of March 20th. [1]</p>

<p>I quite understand-and am glad you took my suggestion in the spirit in which it was made. I was a little anxious about that.</p>

<p>The disability you mention was clear to me when I wrote you. But I thought I would put the suggestion up to you and let you deal with it-as I did not quite know what weight you would place on the turmoil that no doubt it would give rise to.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the kind things you say in your letter, which I am afraid are not quite deserved-as the job here has been an easy one.</p>

<p>With all good wishes, I am, Yours sincerely, R. G. CASEY</p>
