<p>Your K102.</p>

<p>Your account of arrival at Djojakarta confirms our impressions from press and radio reports that while local demonstration may have got a little out of hand (as Republicans appear to have admitted) it did not justify stiff Dutch reaction. Committee should lose no opportunity of urging Netherlands Authorities to take a realistic view of incidents of this sort and of reminding them that they will gain no advantage from holding up negotiations on technicalities.</p>

<p>Suggested minority report on Bantam seems satisfactory.</p>
