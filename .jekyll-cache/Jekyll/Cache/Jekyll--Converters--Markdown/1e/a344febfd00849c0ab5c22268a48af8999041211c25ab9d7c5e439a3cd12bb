I",<p>Cablegram 1053 LONDON, 3 December 1940, 5.45 p.m.</p>

<p>FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL MOST SECRET</p>

<p>PALESTINE. Illicit immigrants. As a result of [disaster] [1] ‘Patria’, question of refusing admission reconsidered by the United Kingdom Government. I strongly questioned the wisdom and urged adherence to decision already taken-my telegram No. 1023.</p>

<p>[2] War Cabinet decided as act of grace and owing to circumstances to admit 1800 ex ‘Patria’.</p>

<p>Wavell [3] has now telegraphed to Eden [4] strongly urging against admission and the British Ambassador at Cairo [5] has also telegraphed Halifax [6] strongly supporting Wavell’s view.</p>

<p>The War Cabinet has been shaken by these communications but feel must adhere to decision with proviso no further illicit immigrants will be admitted under any circumstances.</p>

<p>As I am convinced that the same game will be tried again and have some apprehensions as to the United Kingdom Government’s adhering to proviso suggest a cable from you expressing your views might be helpful in stiffening their attitude.</p>
