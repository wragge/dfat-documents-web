I"*<p>Port Moresby, 1 March 1966</p>

<p><strong>re: Constitutional Committee</strong></p>

<p>The Constitutional Committee met yesterday morning and considered the draft questionnaire which had been drawn up by a Sub-Committee.<a href="#f1">1</a> After much discussion the questionnaire reached a final form and I enclose two (2) copies.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the approach to the people would not be made until after discussions in Canberra, as this meeting would have a great bearing on the approach to be made.</p>

<p>A Sub-Committee consisting of Messrs. Guise, Watkins, Brokam, Scragg, Stuntz, McCarthy, Downs, Abe and Giregire was appointed to draw up a list of subjects touching on special relationships and other matters which it was considered should be discussed by the Committee in Canberra. This Sub-Committee would meet at 2 p.m. on the 1st March, 1966.</p>

<p>The Committee resolved to ask the House to appoint Mr. B. Holloway<a href="#f2">2</a> to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mr. Bloomfield.<a href="#f3">3</a></p>

<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSE</p>

<p>DRAFT QUESTIONNAIRE</p>

<p>1. Do the people consider that the present composition of the House meets the needs of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea?</p>

<p>2. Should the number of electorates and hence number of members be changed, i.e. are there enough electorates or too many or too few?</p>

<p>3. Should there be more rigid qualifications for candidates, e.g. ability to read and write English or Pidgin or Motu, specified standard of education, etc.?</p>

<p>4. Is the present method of counting, i.e. the voluntary preferential system, satisfactory or should a first past the post system be instituted?</p>

<p>5. Do you think it is necessary we should still have Special Electorates?</p>

<p>6. Should all elected positions in the House of Assembly be open to all persons regardless of race, or should some seats be reserved for non-indigenous inhabitants of the Territory.</p>

<p>7. Should there be official members in the House, if so, should the numbers remain as at present or should these be restricted to specific positions?</p>

<p>8. Do you think the legislature should have one House or two Houses?</p>

<p>9. Do you think that a period of internal self-government is necessary before other changes, and if so, how quickly should this take place?</p>

<p>10. Is it the feeling of the people that they want Papua and New Guinea to become one country?</p>

<p>11.</p>

<p><em>Citizenship</em></p>

<p>What are your views on the following:â€”</p>

<p>(a) Should Papua become a Trust Territory with New Guinea and Papuans become Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens?</p>

<p>(b) Should New Guinea become an Australian Territory and New Guineans become Australian citizens rather then Australian protected persons?</p>

<p>(c) Should there be a Papua and New Guinea citizenship?</p>

<p>(d) If so, should it be in close association with Australia?</p>

<p>12. These are the important questions but have you any other matters you would like to mention to the Committee?</p>

<p>[NAA: A452, 1965/3192]</p>
