I"ø<p>Cablegram unnumbered WELLINGTON, 5 May 1940, 8 p.m.</p>

<p>We have now given preliminary consideration to the Secretary of Stateâ€™s Most Secret telegram 130 (Australia 138) of 4th May. [1] We find some difficulty in reconciling the statement contained in the Secretary of Stateâ€™s telegram 122 (Australia 129) of 30th April [2] that â€˜unless the situation shows marked improvementâ€™ convoys U.S.2 and U.S.3 should be diverted, with the recommendation contained in paragraph 16 of telegram now under consideration that â€˜in the present circumstances diversion is unnecessary and that the convoys should adhere to their programmeâ€™. We are, however,. content for our part to allow the convoy U.S.3 to proceed as originally arranged subject- (1) to our being kept most closely informed as to developments as they occur;</p>

<p>(2) to decision as to ultimate destination being made by His Majestyâ€™s Government in New Zealand after considering the views of the Admiralty and of His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom and to our being given an opportunity at the appropriate time of making that decision with the full facts then available;</p>

<p>(3) to our being satisfied as to the adequacy of the escort proposed in the case of diversion from Capetown onward, as to which we are at present not without some doubt.</p>

<p>Before advising His Majestyâ€™s Government in the United Kingdom to the above effect we should be glad to have the views of His Majestyâ€™s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. [3]</p>
