I"^<p>Cablegram Johcu 33 CANBERRA, 29 May 1942</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>I have received from Dr. Evatt [1] a lengthy report on the results of his mission to London.</p>

<p>_express our warmest thanks for your assurances of support, for the instructions issued to the representatives of the Chiefs of Staff to support the requisitions of MacArthur [2] and the representations of the Australian Government, and for the practical assistance you are giving in the matter of equipment. In particular, we are most grateful for the provision of a wing of three Spitfire squadrons, which Dr. Evatt has told me was your own conception. They will be a great contribution to the security of our country and will, we hope, have a demoralizing effect on the Japanese Air Force.</p>

<p>3. The inclusion of an R.A.F. squadron is a magnificent gesture on your part, and I am confident that this practical manifestation of support will do much to encourage the Australian people in their inflexible determination to fight till victory is won.</p>

<p>4. I shall take an opportunity when Parliament reassembles next week to express in general terms the Government’s appreciation of the help you have given to its representative in London. [3]</p>

<p>3 Churchill replied on 30 May: ‘Evatt’s visit has been a great success and he has made many friends over here. I feel I shall have another friend in Australia. Evatt has also repeatedly assured me of your good will. This will be a great help in the many difficulties we have to face together.’ See cablegram Winch 23 (AA:A3195, 1942, 1.21243).</p>
