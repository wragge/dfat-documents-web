# 73 Minute from Moodie to Davis

## 73 Minute from Moodie1 to Davis2

Canberra, 27 August 1965

Confidential

Atomic Intelligence

Timbs telephoned me from AAEC in Sydney, referring to our discussions several weeks ago. 

  2. I gathered from our necessarily guarded conversation that Timbs had had a discussion with a French engineer whom he described as competent and hard-headed. This French engineer had said: 
    1. the French had completed the plutonium re-processing plant in Israel;
    2. the Chinese were making materials available to Indonesia for the explosion of an atomic bomb.
