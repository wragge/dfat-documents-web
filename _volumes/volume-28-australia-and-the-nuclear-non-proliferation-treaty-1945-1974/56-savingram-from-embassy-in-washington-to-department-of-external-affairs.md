## (a) Non-Dissemination of Nuclear Weapons

Rusk informed Couve1 that the Russians were definitely interested in an agreement on nuclear weapons but the U.S. had made it clear that it would not sign such an agreement unless Communist China were one of the signatories as well. Rusk mentioned his fear that lack of an agreement would increase the danger that other countries particularly in the Middle East might receive nuclear weapons.
