# 61 Cablegram from Embassy in Washington to Department of External Affairs

Washington, 15 January 1965

136\. Secret

Prime Minister Sato's1 visit to Washington

  1. Marshall Green2 gave Renouf3 today the following briefing upon the Sato visit.
  2. The most significant points about the visit were fourfold and as followsâ€” 
    1. Sato had made a very good impression as a man of strength, capacity and energy with clarity and correctness of thought.
    2. Far from showing apprehension over China's nuclear progress and feeling that Japan might in this circumstance have to re-adjust her international posture, Sato had said that China's nuclear explosion made the maintenance of the mutual security treaty with the United States even more important.
    3. Relations between the United States and Japan had reached maturity and there was a new ease in the relationship. This had been shown by the fact that both the Americans and Japanese had in the talks treated each other as equals and adults. For example, there had not been on this occasion (as distinct from similar occasions in the past) any tendency by the Americans to lecture or hector the Japanese and for their part the Japanese had not shown any sign of humility or timidity.
    4. Whereas in the past such top-level exchanges between the United States and Japan had been largely devoted to bilateral questions, 90 percent of this week's talks had been devoted to broader international problems. It was quite clear that Japan was now re-entering the current of world political affairs and Sato's intention was to accelerate the re-entry process.

## Pacific Nuclear Force

  15. When the mention of this subject in foreign report of 7th January4 was recalled to Green, he said that there had not been any talk in Washington with Sato of an American-Japanese nuclear force, the question was not one of Japanese government policy. Nevertheless, there were Japanese in Tokyo who were interested in this idea and one could expect to hear more of it in the future.



## Disarmament

  16. Sato had asked the United States to help in getting Japan made a member of the 18-member Disarmament Committee. The United States had merely promised to consider this request.
