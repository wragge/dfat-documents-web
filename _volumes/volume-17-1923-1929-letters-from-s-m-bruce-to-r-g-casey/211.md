1st August, 1929

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

(Due to arrive Canberra 30.8.29)

My dear P.M.,

Reference my P. & C. 37 of 16th May [1] and your reply of 24th June-with reference to the method adopted here for coping with the answering of questions put to the Government during a General Election by organisations and individuals.

I enclose copy of a summary of the arrangements in this regard, written after the General Election by the Secretary to the Emergency Business Committee of the Cabinet. This reviews the experience of the working of this scheme and may possibly be of use to your advisers in the future.

I am, Yours sincerely, R.G. CASEY 

_1 Letter 197. In his reply of 24june (on file AA:A1420) Bruce expressed general interest.
