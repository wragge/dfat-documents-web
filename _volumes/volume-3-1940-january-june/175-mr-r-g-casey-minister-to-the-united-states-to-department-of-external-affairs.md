# 175 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 67 WASHINGTON, 24 April 1940

PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET NOT TO BE QUOTED OR GIVEN CIRCULATION

United States Navy enquired lately of British Admiralty if they could use Singapore base in certain eventualities. Reply 'Yes, certainly.' I do not believe this has particular political significance but is interesting.
