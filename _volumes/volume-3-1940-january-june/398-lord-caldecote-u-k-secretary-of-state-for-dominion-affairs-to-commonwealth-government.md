# 398 Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Commonwealth Government

Circular cablegram D266 LONDON, 17 June 1940, 11.20 p.m.

SECRET

The Italian Government have indicated their willingness to facilitate departure of British Consuls from Italian territory provided that similar action is taken in respect of Italian Consuls in British territory.

His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have given assurances that so far as they are concerned similar facilities will be given on a reciprocal basis.

It would be of great assistance in securing satisfactory attitude on the part of the Italian Government if similar action were taken as regards Italian Consular officers in other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
