Australian representation in Japan. His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia would appreciate if you would immediately initiate necessary steps to give effect to our wish to appoint Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Tokyo.

On assumption that in accordance with instructions conveyed to Australian High Commissioner in London on January 25th last [1] informal approval of His Majesty has already been obtained we understand that next step immediately necessary would be informal approach to Japanese Government.

For sake of expedition we would appreciate if Ambassador at Tokyo [2] could be instructed on receipt of Japanese Government's informal approval to proceed at once to official approach. At same time as these approaches we desire Ambassador to raise question whether Japanese Government would be prepared to reciprocate in the appointment of a Minister to Australia.

On completion of these steps we would propose without further delay to secure informal submission to His Majesty for approval name of person that it is desired to appoint.
