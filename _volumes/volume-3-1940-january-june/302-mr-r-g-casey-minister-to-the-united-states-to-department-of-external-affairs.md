# 302 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 101 WASHINGTON, 28 May 1940

I discussed New Zealand Prime Minister's message [1] with the President [2] today. He asked that his thanks be conveyed to Mr.

Fraser. President is clearly unable in circumstances to make formal reply [3] but I suggest that Fraser be informed by completely safe means of gist of my No. 100. [4]

3 Roosevelt did in fact reply formally to Fraser through Casey (see Welles's letter to Casey of 1 June 1940 on file AA: A3300, 46).
