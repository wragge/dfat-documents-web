Wool. See our telegrams 23rd February [1] and 12th March [2] raising questions regarding price charged for wool to neutrals and basis of profit sharing. We can see no valid reason for complete absence any reply and desire you to convey to Ministry our insistence immediate advice.

The time for review of the price is approaching and we desire the two points mentioned above to be cleared up before the major price review takes place.

We consider we have been very patient regarding wool in circumstances which have frequently been exasperating, and we desire you adopt stiff attitude in pressing for the reply mentioned above. [3]
