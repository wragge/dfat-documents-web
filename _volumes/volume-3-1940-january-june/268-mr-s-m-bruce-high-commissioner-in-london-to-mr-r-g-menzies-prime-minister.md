Cablegram 348 LONDON, 23 May 1940, 7.10 p.m.

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

My telegram of 22nd May. [1] In addition to drive to speed up production of aeroplanes every source from which additional planes and trained personnel can be obtained being examined.

Canada being asked to release all Hurricanes being produced there and the United Kingdom Government now submitted definite request for diversion of your Hudsons from America. Also asking whether you could supply squadron of Hudsons to replace a Blenheim squadron at Singapore.

Canada discussing with United Kingdom Government reducing operational squadrons on West coast to care and maintenance parties and sending personnel to United Kingdom for immediate active service.

Possibility also being considered of applying this procedure to operational squadrons other than those on West coast.

Please advise me as soon as possible as to your attitude with regard to Hudsons in the United States and squadron for Singapore, also whether there is anything you could do to make trained personnel available immediately and/or over next two or three months.

BRUCE
