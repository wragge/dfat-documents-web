## Letter 25 June 1940 MOST SECRET,

With reference to Most Secret and Personal telegram No. 191 from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, setting out the situation regarding Iceland [1], I am directed by the Prime Minister [2] to express to you his hope that, in view of the vital importance of Iceland, no forces will be withdrawn even when further Canadian reinforcements arrive, unless it is absolutely sure that the troops remaining there are ample to meet any contingency.

F. STRAHAN
