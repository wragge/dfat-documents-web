# 285 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 238 27 May 1940,

MOST SECRET

Australian Minister, Washington [1], has asked for full summary of naval and other relevant defensive and supply particulars Darwin for information in certain eventualities of good friends Washington.

In view of importance of Darwin as operational base in event of war in Pacific area, and its place in Imperial Defence, we propose, subject to your not having any objection, to forward full details to the Minister, but divided into two categories:

(a) Information that may be released to the U.S.A. authorities prior to the U.S.A. entering the war on the British side;

(b) Full details to be released when U.S.A. becomes ally of British Empire.

Would be glad to learn whether you agree to this proposal. [2]
