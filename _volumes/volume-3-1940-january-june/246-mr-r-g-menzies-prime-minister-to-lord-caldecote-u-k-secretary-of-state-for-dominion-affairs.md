# 246 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

## Cablegram [226] [1] 16 May 1940,

Thanks for your telegram of 15th May advising me that His Majesty has entrusted to you the Seals of the Dominions Office. [2] I have noted with satisfaction that as in the case of your predecessor you will have access to the War Cabinet so that contact may be maintained between it and the Dominions Office. In offering you my congratulations I wish to assure you that you may rely on full co- operation of the Commonwealth Government.
