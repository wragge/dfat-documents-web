# 354 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Prime Minister's Department

## Cablegram 396 LONDON, 10 June 1940, 6.30 p.m.

With reference to High Commissioner's telegram (most secret) to the Prime Minister of 8th June No. 392. [1] Following two paragraphs were inadvertently omitted and should now be inserted after the word ['Port Sudan']. (begins) British ships. [2] Dominions Office telegram D. 237 paragraph 4.

[3] This is based on communication to Lothian [4] of which [I] only heard after its despatch. The suggested policy in my view is most ill-advised and I have uttered the strongest protest.

Fortunately Lothian reacted most unfavourably and the idea has been dropped. I am trying to find out who was responsible for cable sent to Lothian.

Egypt. Latest reports show position deteriorating badly in face of probability of Italy entering the war. They will require rougher handling than they have received to date.

BRUCE
