# 10 Dr C. J. Pao, Chinese Consul-General in Australia, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Letter 9 January 1940,

I read with great interest of the appointment of Mr. Casey as the 

first Australian Minister to Washington, and would like to take 

this opportunity to congratulate you for your unprecedented 

leadership in building this necessary bridge across the Pacific. 

Co-prosperity among the nations in the Pacific would be impossible 

should one not be understood by the other. I can visualise the 

gigantic contribution of this country, under your leadership, 

towards the advancement of civilization of mankind and the 

reconstruction of the world.

Last April, nine months ago, you mentioned to me the necessity of 

a closer association and a better understanding among the Pacific 

nations. I also learned of the desire of your Government to 

establish diplomatic representations in Chungking and Tokio after 

the completion of the procedure of establishing your Legation in 

Washington. These two representations, when established,, will 

join the one at Washington to bind the Pacific Powers watertight, 

and the united efforts of the three Ministers of this great nation 

under your leadership will be, as Confucius so aptly said, 'the 

old horse' to lead the way towards permanent peace. I then cabled 

to my Government and was instructed that China will be ready to 

reciprocate at any time when preparation for diplomatic 

representation of Australia to my country is made by you. This 

view was conveyed to you in Canberra by me in person last May.

The press reported today your immediate consideration of a 

Minister to Tokio. Under the present circumstances I cannot but 

think that our most urgent task in building peace in the Pacific 

is to remove Japan's misunderstanding. The establishment of 

diplomatic representation in Tokio will certainly help the work, 

and your farsight deserves admiration. However, there comes to me 

naturally a question; What will be the diplomatic relation between 

Australia and China?

I know there is no misunderstanding between our two countries. 

People may think, however, that as long as there is the Sino-

Japanese War, the conditions in China may not be settled; and 

because of that they hold the view that a Minister to China should 

be postponed. My dear Prime Minister, I personally think that 

because of the Sino-Japanese War the exchange of diplomatic 

representations between our two countries is more urgent than 

ever. Whatever the outcome of the physical struggle between China 

and Japan may be, China will not vanish, not only because her 

power of resistance is increasing every day, but also because of 

the fact that she is a civilization. I personally think that there 

is no victory of any war in the real sense, and the result of the 

Sino-Japanese War will be that Japan will have to abandon her 

policy of aggressive activities due to the pressure of her own 

internal as well as external difficulties, and that my country 

will be so developed that she will be capable not only to guard 

her own national independence but will also be able to shoulder 

the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Pacific with her 

sister nations. It is at this time that the exchange of diplomatic 

representations between this great country, whose purpose is to 

achieve peace in the Pacific, with China, whose national aim is 

similar to that of yours, is most urgent. The appointment of a 

Minister to Tokio without considering simultaneously one to 

Chungking may enhance difficulties, if not jeopardise 

international relations and status, to China, in view of the 

present international situation. There may be some difficulties 

connected with the appointment of an Australian Minister to 

Chungking, but the urgency and necessity of such a move are so 

intense and great that those difficulties can be easily overcome.

Please excuse me for taking this liberty to present this view to 

you in such a personal way. Since we understand each other well 

and because of the fact that it is of mutual benefit of our two 

countries, I have not hesitated to ask your advice in this 

connection. The appointment of an Australian Minister to Chungking 

simultaneously with that of one to Tokio would help to clear 

matters and maintain the balance of power which is indispensable 

to peace with justice. I know my Government and my people will 

give every facility for such an undertaking.

With my best regards and hoping to hear from you.

1 On 10 January 1940 Pao forwarded a copy of this letter to Sir 

John Latham, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, with a 

covering letter (on the file here cited) requesting Latham to 'say 

a word or two to Mr. Menzies in regard to that matter'.
