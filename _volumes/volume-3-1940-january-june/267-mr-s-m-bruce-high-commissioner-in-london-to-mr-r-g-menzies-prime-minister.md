# 267 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 350 LONDON, 23 May 1940, 10 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Your cable re Roosevelt [1] have just learnt that War Cabinet considered it on basis that you were suggesting public appeal and that reply was being drafted on this assumption. I have pointed out that this is a complete misunderstanding and that your suggestion was the reinforcement, privately and personally, as representing young democratic dominions, of efforts Churchill [2] already making.
