# 222 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 10 May 1940,

MOST SECRET

Your telegram 29th April. [1] Czechoslovak National Committee. As it did not appear from your telegram that Benes [2] had made any actual request for recognition of Committee by Commonwealth Government and as Dominions Office despatch No. D.1 of January 3rd [3] merely conveyed text of Halifax-Benes correspondence without suggestion for expression of our views, the Commonwealth Government has not thought it necessary to communicate any opinion on this matter. In circumstances however would be glad if you would now inform United Kingdom Government that Commonwealth Government is quite prepared to recognise Czechoslovak National Committee strictly for same purposes in Commonwealth territory as those laid down in respect of United Kingdom in Halifax-Benes letters, namely that the Committee is qualified to represent the Czechoslovak peoples in particular for purposes of reconstruction of Czechoslovak Army in France.
