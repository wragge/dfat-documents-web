# 113 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 48 WASHINGTON, 25 March 1940, 5.38 p.m.

MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Bruce has sent me his cable of 17th February [1] and yours of 23rd February [2] regarding wool. I have discussed with the British Ministry of Economic Warfare representative here. [3] The State Department, which is now the Department concerned, have no objection to wool being sold to Japan on three-monthly basis in place of one month so long as not sold on extension of credit. I have so cabled Bruce. [4]
