# 9 Mr A. T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 22 LONDON, 9 January 1940

MOST SECRET

TIMOR

My H524 [1] and telegrams Nos. 616 [2] and 3. [3] Further 

information now available from 'secret but entirely trustworthy 

source' referred to in previous telegrams.

(1) In a telegram to the Japanese Minister at Lisbon [4] on 24th 

November the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs [5] referred to 

Japan's desire to proceed in due course to develop Timor's oil 

resources and urged him 'to bear in mind the great importance of 

the question in relation realization our national [fuel] [6] 

supply scheme and also as an offset to the American "stringent 

embargo" against Japan'.

(2) On 4th December the Japanese Minister at Lisbon reported to 

the Minister for Foreign Affairs that 'it will be quite impossible 

for us to gain our desired objectives by means of ordinary 

negotiations. Judging from Portugal's treatment of Belgian 

interests and from unjust suspicions that Bitoque's (presumably 

Wittouck [7]) activities with a view to getting oil rights are 

being carried out in co-operation with Japan, there is reason to 

suspect that Portuguese have decided definitely not to grant such 

concessions to Japan'.

(3) On 21st December the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs 

telegraphed to the Minister at Lisbon: 'We consider that we must 

make use of Macao to break this deadlock', instancing the cutting 

of land and water communication in order to induce an acute food 

shortage, or occupation of the coast opposite Macao. Pointing out 

that he wanted to attain his objective if possible without 

resorting to such pressure he authorized the Minister 'to make 

dear our demands and, if they persist in refusing to reconsider 

the matter, to hint in a roundabout way at pressure'. He added: 

'It is quite possible that as you say the machinations of Great 

Britain are behind this business so it may be necessary to 

negotiate with Great Britain too, depending on how the matter 

develops'.

(4) On 22nd December the Japanese Minister at Lisbon reported home 

that Australian contract was now as good as settled. He asked the 

Minister for Foreign Affairs: 'Do your instructions mean that you 

intend to dispute the monopoly of the Australian company over the 

area in which they have the concession?' i.e. east of longitude 

125 degrees 50 minutes east. He pointed out that 'an early 

withdrawal of the Australian monopoly is link[ed] up with 

closeness of relations which bind the Portuguese Government with 

British'. He urged that Japan should try to acquire rights in the 

district west longitude mentioned above comprising roughly one-

third of Portuguese Timor and having established a footing bide 

her time until a proper opportunity presented itself.

(5) On 30th December the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs 

replied:

'Although we should be satisfied if Sapt's [8] entry into the 

field were permitted, what I believed to be essential was that the 

monopoly itself should be disputed and that Portuguese should be 

made to be to [sic] first to suggest a definite scheme for a 

compromise. If we endeavoured to acquire concession for the 

western territory that would be tantamount to overlooking for the 

time being fact of other party being in possession and I would 

therefore prefer not to make such a proposal as yet'.

(With regard to the proposed pressure on Macao you will remember 

similar reports to this effect early in 1939.)
