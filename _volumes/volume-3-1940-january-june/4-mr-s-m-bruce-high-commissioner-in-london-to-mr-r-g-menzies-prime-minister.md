# 4 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 11 LONDON, 5 January [1940], 7.10 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Dominions Office have forwarded by official 

despatch [1] which should reach you about 15th January letters 

exchanged on 20th December between Halifax [2] and Benes [3] with 

regard to the formation of a Czechoslovak national committee of 

which Benes is actually though not technically the president. In 

his letter Halifax, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, 

'[recognises] [4] that the committee is qualified to represent the 

Czechoslovak peoples', in particular for the purposes of the 

reconstruction of the Czechoslovak army in France.

Hitherto the United Kingdom Government has been careful to 

distinguish between Bohemia and Moravia on the one hand and 

Slovakia on the other.

Their attitude, however, is that the step just taken does not 

really constitute any change in policy, that they do not at 

present propose to enter into any commitments regarding the future 

status or boundaries of any territories included in the former 

Czechoslovak state, and that the phrase 'Czechoslovak peoples' in 

plural was adopted to leave open the question of the future status 

and mutual relations of the Czechs and Slovaks. They state that 

action was taken for three reasons:-

(1) to encourage resistance of the Czech and Slovak peoples to 

Germany;

(2) to keep in step with the French Government who had already 

recognised the national committee of [13th November];

(3) to take account of public feeling aroused here and in the 

Dominions and in neutral countries by the treatment inflicted upon 

the Czechs and Slovaks in Germany.

Of these (3) [5] was clearly the deciding factor. I cannot help 

feeling that present step will be construed abroad as an intention 

to reconstruct former state of Czechoslovakia.

British Minister in Hungary [6] for instance considered the change 

'a matter of the greatest moment to the Hungarian Government' and 

urgently requested instructions as to what line he should take 

with them.

Benes is coming to see me next week having in mind similar 

recognition by Australia. I will be entirely non-committal.
