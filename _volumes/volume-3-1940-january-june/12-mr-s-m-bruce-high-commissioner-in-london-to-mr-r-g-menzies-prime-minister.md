# 12 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 28 LONDON, 11 January 1940, 8.35 p.m.

MOST SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF MOST

I had strongly represented to the United Kingdom Government points 

included in My telegram No. 27 [1] and had been led to believe 

that the War Cabinet this morning would decide against immediate 

action.

Now learn that while Cabinet divided, the Secretary of State for 

Foreign Affairs [2] being the strongest opponent, the majority in 

favour of proceeding immediately with stoppage of Narvik supplies 

by action in Norwegian territorial waters and decision to this 

effect may be taken tomorrow morning.

In my view the importance of such a decision cannot be exaggerated 

and that it should be taken without fullest consultation with the 

Dominions would be an outrage.

I have put this to the United Kingdom Government as strongly as I 

can but in view of the fact that Winston Churchill [3] with 

considerable support in Cabinet is fighting for an immediate 

decision it is imperative that you support me. I suggest that you 

cable the Prime Minister [4] immediately down the lines that in 

view of the importance and possible repercussions of decision to 

take action in Norwegian territorial waters to cut off German 

supplies of iron ore you request that no decision should be taken 

by the United Kingdom Cabinet before the Dominions have had an 

opportunity to express their views and asking that you should be 

fully informed of arguments in favour of such action, and should 

be supplied with a summary of the appreciation of the General 

Staff as to assistance that could be rendered to Norway and 

particularly to Sweden in event of such action leading to an 

attack by Germany on one or both of these countries. Imperative 

that you cable immediately as the War Cabinet meets 11.30 a.m. 

tomorrow (Friday).

BRUCE
