# 220 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 9 May 1940, 9.55 p.m.

SECRET AND PERSONAL

My telegram today. [1] By good chance, I sat next to Cross [2] at lunch today. As result of our conversation, am convinced that the suggestion of Owen Dixon [3] practicable and would have admirable results. Believe could be so arranged that Dixon could do invaluable work both for Australia and the general policy of economic warfare. Matter will have to be handled unofficially owing to susceptibilities of other Dominions but I believe that if Dixon prepared to undertake work and you so advise me I could arrange it. [4]

4 On 10 May 1940 Menzies informed Bruce that Dixon was prepared to undertake the work (see unnumbered cablegram in series FA: A3196, 0.2873). On 16 May Bruce reported that he intended to take the matter up with Cross's successor, Dr Hugh Dalton, but there is no evidence that he did so (see Bruce's cablegram 332 on file AA:

A1608, L37/1/5).
