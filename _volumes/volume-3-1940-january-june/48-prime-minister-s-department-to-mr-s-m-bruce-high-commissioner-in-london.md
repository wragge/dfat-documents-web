# 48 Prime Minister's Department to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 7 February 1940,

SECRET

Your cablegram 25th January. [1] Commonwealth officers have been in personal communication with the Dutch Consul [2] following Brodribb's [3] interviews at Sourabaya in December. They also have lists of the proposed materials and consider that after detailed examination it may be possible to supply at least some of the requirements later in the year.

The Consul agreed that it would be wise to defer the proposed visit of the Military Mission for several months when our own capacities will be better known. During the interim period technical information can be exchanged between officers of both Governments.

As there is no immediate urgency it is proposed to follow this course.
