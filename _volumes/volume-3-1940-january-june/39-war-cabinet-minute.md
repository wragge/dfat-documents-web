# 39 War Cabinet Minute

## Minute 142 MELBOURNE, 5 February 1940

ALLIED PEACE AIMS

The Prime Minister [1] read cablegram No. B.214 of 1st February from the High Commissioner on the desirability of a joint declaration of Anglo-French peace aims and the importance of the Dominions urging the convening of Empire consultations, with a view to early discussions with the French. [2]

The matter was discussed by War Cabinet, but the views of the High Commissioner as to the nature of the Empire's peace aims and the proposed course of action did not meet with general agreement.
