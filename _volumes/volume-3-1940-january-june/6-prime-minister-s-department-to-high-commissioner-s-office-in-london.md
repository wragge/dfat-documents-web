# 6 Prime Minister's Department to High Commissioner's Office in London

## Cablegram unnumbered 8 January 1940,

Your telegram 20th December. [1] Production of Foodstuffs War Time 

and Post-War requirements. The circumstances stated in your 

telegram under heading War Situation is [sic] certainly of 

interest to Australia, and we wish you to continue to explore on 

lines you indicated and advise as soon as possible.

Dairy Produce and Pig Meat are especially capable of quick 

expansion.

Regarding post-war position we have fear serious problem would be 

involved if we were to stimulate production to meet war time 

requirements without an assurance of adequate post-war markets. 

Whole matter will be considered by Agricultural Council next month 

when we would like to give them some idea (general perhaps at this 

stage) as to how we would safeguard the future should we expand 

production to meet war time requirements.

1 On file AA: A1608, A37/1/4, i. Bruce reported that he was 

alarmed at the lack of co-ordination between the U.K. departments 

responsible for food, agriculture and shipping. He had urged an 

immediate survey of U.K. and French commodity needs in the war 

situation and of how these needs could be met from U.K., Dominion 

and neutral sources. In regard to the postwar situation Bruce did 

not consider the U.K. Govt could at that stage make any commitment 

because the announcement of any future increase in Imperial 

Preference would strengthen the German position in Scandinavia and 

have most unfortunate repercussions in the United States. 

Furthermore the United Kingdom would insist on reciprocal 

preference; which would be difficult to contemplate in view of the 

increase of Australia's secondary industries. Bruce nevertheless 

believed that if agreement could be reached as to the directions 

in which Australia should expand her wartime production some 

arrangement reasonably safeguarding the future could be arrived 

at.
