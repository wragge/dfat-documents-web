# 8 Mr M. Akiyama, Japanese Consul-General in Australia, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Telegram n.d. [on or after 8 January 1940]

I heartily congratulate you on the widely significant appointment 

of an Australian Minister to Washington which indicates the 

positive attitude of the Commonwealth of Australia for the 

maintenance of peace in the Pacific and forms a momentous 

contribution towards the betterment of the relationship between 

the nations concerned. I also appreciate your statement that the 

Commonwealth has under immediate consideration the appointment of 

a Minister to Tokyo. [1]
