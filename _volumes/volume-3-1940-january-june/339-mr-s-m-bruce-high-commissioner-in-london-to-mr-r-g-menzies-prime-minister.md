Cablegram [382] [1] (extract) LONDON, 4 June 1940, 9.05 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Following is result of endeavours to ascertain the position in France: Morale and determination of the people high but owing to lack of any outstanding leader in politics trusted by the people desire of masses for stout and sustained resistance may not be realized.

Churchill [2] better known and trusted by French population than own leaders.

With a Clemenceau [3] the French could be relied on-without, I have grave doubts.
