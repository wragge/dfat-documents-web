# 206 Commonwealth Government to Mr A. Eden, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 198 3 May 1940,

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Your cablegram 136. [1] It was noted from your cablegram 129 [2] that unless situation shows marked improvement you proposed to order convoy U.S.2 to be diverted before it enters the Gulf of Aden. Our proposal for detention at Colombo was to safeguard ourselves against a situation in which under certain possible circumstances our troops might be held up indefinitely in some port with less favourable climatic and other conditions than Colombo.

We assume our concurrence in convoy proceeding as originally arranged will cover this eventuality should it arise, and Chief of Naval Staff [3] has been requested to advise Commander of Escort as desired. [4]
