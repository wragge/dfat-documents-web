# 314 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 367 LONDON, 30 May 1940, 9.56 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Evacuation of the B.E.F. to date more successful than anticipated.

Troops have maintained morale and fought magnificently. Have demonstrated superiority over Germans individually and that tanks can be overcome by resolute troops with anti-tank guns. If this can be brought home to the French it may have tremendous effect.

Air force has done amazing work in covering withdrawal and new defiance [1] yesterday had remarkable successes. Navy's work beyond praise.

No important developments Somme area.

Dominions office cable number M 32 [2] really does not alter Italian position as it has been appreciated for some time.
