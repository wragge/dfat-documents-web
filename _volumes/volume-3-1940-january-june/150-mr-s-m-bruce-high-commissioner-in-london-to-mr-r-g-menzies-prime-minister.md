# 150 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 249 LONDON, 16 April 1940, 7.30 p.m.

MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Netherlands East Indies (my telegram No. 244 [1] second last paragraph). Craigie [2] has now strongly expressed the view that the United States Government should be approached re the position of the Netherlands East Indies in the event of German invasion of the Netherlands.

Suggest would be desirable if you telegraphed indicating great importance you attach to the N.E.I. and urging that immediate approach should be made to the United States with a view to frank discussion of the position in the event of German invasion of Holland.
