# 118 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 209 LONDON, 29 March 1940, 7.16 p.m.

MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Dominions Office cabling full report of discussions and decisions of Supreme War Council. [1] Re Norwegian territorial waters previous consideration was governed by the effect of action upon major objectives of saving Finland and occupying Gallivare ore fields. Both of these possibilities having now disappeared, the time has arrived when, as indicated in my telegram No. 143 of 25th February [2], 'if major proposals have to be abandoned it should be examined on its own merits'. Decision of the Supreme War Council is based upon action down the lines indicated in the last paragraph of my telegram No. 71 of 26th January [3], which has since been taken.
