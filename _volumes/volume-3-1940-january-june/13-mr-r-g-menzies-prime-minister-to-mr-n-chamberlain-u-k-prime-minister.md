# 13 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr N. Chamberlain, U.K. Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered 12 January 1940,

URGENT AND MOST SECRET

In view of the importance and possible repercussions of any 

decision to take action in Norwegian territorial waters to cut off 

German supplies of iron ore I earnestly request that no decision 

should be taken by the United Kingdom Cabinet until the Dominions 

have had an opportunity to express their views.

To enable these views to be formed I suggest that we should be 

fully informed of the arguments in favour of and against the 

proposed action and that we should be supplied with a summary of 

any appreciation by the General Staff of the assistance that could 

be rendered to Norway and Sweden in the event of the proposed 

action leading to an attack by Germany on one or both of these 

countries.

While I realise the significance of the iron ore export to Germany 

my present disposition is to think that the suggested action would 

have a bad effect in neutral countries and might present arguments 

to Germany which she would not otherwise have. [1]
