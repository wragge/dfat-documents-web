# 159 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 18 April 1940, 8.37 p.m.

Your telegram 17th April. [1]

Owing to the tense atmosphere recently and changes of Ministers in Departments of Food and Shipping, have been unable to progress in dried and canned fruit discussions and in clearing up shipping position.

Have now had most useful personal and private talk with Woolton [2] and am seeing Hudson [3] in the same way to-morrow. Am hopeful as a result of these conversations of making progress towards clearing up the position in the next few days.

BRUCE
