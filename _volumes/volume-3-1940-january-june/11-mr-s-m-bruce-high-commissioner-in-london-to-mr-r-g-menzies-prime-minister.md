# 11 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 27 LONDON, 11 January 1940, 6.27 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF MOST SECRET

My telegram No. 9. [1] In view of strong reaction by Norway to 

communication (Dominions Office No. 7) [2] and change of attitude 

by Sweden, who now strongly opposed, stopping of Narvik iron ore 

supplies being re-examined by Cabinet. Following are material 

points for consideration. Stoppage of supplies from Narvik the 

only port of shipment from the northern field for the next four 

months no doubt troublesome but probably not really serious to 

Germany. Unless possible to stop shipment from Lulea when that 

port reopens action against Narvik would be of relatively small 

value.

In addition following have to be borne in mind.

(1) Would cause bitter resentment in Norway and Sweden.

(2) Would conceivably lead Norway to feel compelled, in order to 

protect her neutrality, to resist by force our action in her 

territorial waters.

(3) Would antagonise opinion in neutral countries particularly the 

United States with its large Scandinavian population.

(4) Would afford a pretext of some appearance of justification for 

Germany either to take armed action against Sweden or to take her 

under German protection.

Because of relative ineffectiveness and political and military 

consequences, wisdom of action against Narvik supplies at the 

moment would appear doubtful. So much importance attached here to 

cutting off German supplies of Swedish iron ore that serious 

consideration being given to the question of bringing Sweden into 

the war on the Allies' side.

Prime Minister [3] strongly urged that before attempting to do 

this either by provoking Germany to attack or inducing Sweden to 

declare war, we must be certain that the United Kingdom and France 

are in a position to render sufficient aid to prevent Germans from 

overrunning Sweden.

I have also urged that in considering the question of what aid 

could be given to Sweden the possibility of a move by Germany 

and/or Russia in the Danubian and Balkan countries, necessitating 

the United Kingdom and France establishing an eastern front with 

further drain on man power, supplies and shipping, must not be 

overlooked.
