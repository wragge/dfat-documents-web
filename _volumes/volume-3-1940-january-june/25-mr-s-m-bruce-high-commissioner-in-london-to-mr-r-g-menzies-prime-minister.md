# 25 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 63 LONDON, 24 January 1940

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

As a result of French representations (Dominions Office D.37) [1] action against Narvik shipments further examined by War Cabinet today and proposal for laying mine fields in Norwegian territorial waters considered.

In my view there is an absence of clear thinking as to objectives and consequences of contemplated action.

I have accordingly urged United Kingdom Government that it is unreasonable to ask for concurrence of Dominions in action which might have the most far-reaching consequences unless they have been fully informed of grounds which led to decision, of possible consequences that may result, and of steps that could be taken to meet them.

Endeavouring to arrange meeting tomorrow with Prime Minister [2] and Halifax. [3] I am hopeful that as a result of such meeting full information down the lines indicated above will be cabled for your comment before final decision taken by War Cabinet. [4]

BRUCE
