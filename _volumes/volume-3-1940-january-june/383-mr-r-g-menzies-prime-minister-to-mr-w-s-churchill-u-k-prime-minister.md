# 383 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr W. S. Churchill, U.K. Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered 15 June 1940,

MOST SECRET

In considering your telegraphic advices on present situation, I feel that question of probable attitude of German Government after Hitler's entry into Paris requires urgent attention.

Hitler may almost immediately suggest terms on which he is prepared to conclude peace with the Allies. These terms might be either (a) such as are impossible of acceptance, or (b) terms which might, on face value, appear to be comparatively reasonable and designed to glorify Hitler as a magnanimous victor who has a real desire for a peaceful world.

Position (a) would create no great difficulty in reply. The second alternative, however, would make very careful consideration essential and expression of Empire's attitude would after consultation with Dominion Prime Ministers require to be most carefully framed so that we would not weaken our position in world opinion, and particularly in the United States of America.

I think it is necessary that we should consult the United States frankly and completely as to the form of our reply to any peace offer, no matter what form it might take. Such close collaboration with the United States should, I feel, whenever possible be made a feature of every phase of our future effort.
