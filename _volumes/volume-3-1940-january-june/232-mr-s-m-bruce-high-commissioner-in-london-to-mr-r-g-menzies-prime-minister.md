# 232 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 319 LONDON, 12 May 1940, 4.53 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

BELGIUM Latest information shows that the Allies have now occupied the line Namur-Louvain and have advance forces in front of this line. Advance yesterday was subject to practically no air interference. This in addition to the fact that land attack against Belgium and Holland has not been on anything like the scale anticipated causing questioning as to whether this is the main plan or whether the main attack will not be through Switzerland. Concentrated effort against the United Kingdom also a possibility. Even if this correct, difficult to appreciate the reason why attack on Belgium and Holland not being on the fullest scale as shortening of line by the Allies successfully moving forward to Antwerp-Namur releases fifteen Allied divisions and increases the Allies strength by twenty Belgian divisions. The Belgian position more satisfactory than anticipated.

HOLLAND Latest information states that the Dutch on top at The Hague and the position generally in hand in south-west Holland.

German troops still landing from the air and the position still anxious. Two French motorised divisions landed at Flushing and should greatly influence the position.

NORWAY No further information re Narvik. The Germans have now reached Mosjoen. Still feel great anxiety as to the position in Norway.
