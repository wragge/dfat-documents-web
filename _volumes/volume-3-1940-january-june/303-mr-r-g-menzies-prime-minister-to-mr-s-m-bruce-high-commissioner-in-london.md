# 303 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram 56 29 May 1940,

PERSONAL FOR BRUCE

Suggestions in your telegram 360 [1] have been acted on in personal communication to Prime Minister. [2] Your points were amplified, and in addition we asked for examination of effect on our position in Mediterranean, Egypt and Near East as Italy seems bound to intervene at stage under contemplation even if she had not done so previously.
