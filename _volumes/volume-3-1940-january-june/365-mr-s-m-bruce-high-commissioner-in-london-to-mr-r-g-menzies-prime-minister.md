Cablegram 409 LONDON, 12 June 1940

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

On receipt of your telegram of 28th May [1] I at once advised Halifax [2] accordingly. Foreign Office have now advised that they consulted Dutch Government in London (also Governor-General of Netherlands East Indies [3]) and permission was granted for landing at Sourabaya. Dutch Government advised that it would be most convenient for actual arrangements to be made between Governor-General of Netherlands East Indies and Canberra direct and stated they had instructed Governor-General accordingly.

Foreign Office also instructed Craigie [4] that if the flight attracted attention in Japan he should explain that Hudsons were replacing R.A. F. squadron at Singapore. No reactions however have been reported from Tokyo.
