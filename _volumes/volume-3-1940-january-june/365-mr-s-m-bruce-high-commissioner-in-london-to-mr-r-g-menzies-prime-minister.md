# 365 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 409 LONDON, 12 June 1940

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

On receipt of your telegram of 28th May [1] I at once advised Halifax [2] accordingly. Foreign Office have now advised that they consulted Dutch Government in London (also Governor-General of Netherlands East Indies [3]) and permission was granted for landing at Sourabaya. Dutch Government advised that it would be most convenient for actual arrangements to be made between Governor-General of Netherlands East Indies and Canberra direct and stated they had instructed Governor-General accordingly.

Foreign Office also instructed Craigie [4] that if the flight attracted attention in Japan he should explain that Hudsons were replacing R.A. F. squadron at Singapore. No reactions however have been reported from Tokyo.
