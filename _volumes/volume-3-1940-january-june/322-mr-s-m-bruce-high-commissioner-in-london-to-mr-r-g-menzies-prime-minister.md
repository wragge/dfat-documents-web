Cablegram 370 (extract) LONDON, 31 May 1940, 10 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL HIMSELF

Prime Minister [1] has gone to Paris following request for British troops, tanks, anti-tank guns and air support, taking the Lord Privy Seal [2] on account of contacts with Blum [3] and other Socialists to discuss position. Request for troops in my view not so much to increase fighting strength as because of effect on French morale.

NARVIK. Possibility that Norway will have to be evacuated has to be visualized. Such action could not have other than bad psychological effect, but I do not believe the strain of maintaining effort in men, aeroplanes, shipping and immobilizing strong naval forces (some 27 destroyers are at Narvik) can be kept up.
