# 290 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr F. K. Officer, Counsellor of the Legation in Washington

## Cablegram 14 LONDON, 28 May 1940

Your cablegram No. 24. [1] My cablegram No. 344 [2] points in which are covered by Prime Minister's cable to President [3] and 359 [4] were sent merely to inform Mr. Casey [5] of what I have telegraphed.

I did not intend any personal views of mine should be conveyed to Sumner Welles [6] or the President.

You however are on the spot and I have such complete confidence in your judgement that I entirely accept the course you have adopted.

BRUCE
