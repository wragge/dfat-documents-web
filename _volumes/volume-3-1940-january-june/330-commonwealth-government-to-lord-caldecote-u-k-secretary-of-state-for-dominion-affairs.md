# 330 Commonwealth Government to Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 256 3 June 1940,

SECRET

It would be of great assistance if we could have some idea of intentions or contemplations respecting A.I.F. in Near East.

Question of equipment which could be supplied from here is under discussion between High Commissioner and War Office. Matter is vitally affected by practicability of shipment and we would be glad have enlightenment as to what is in view in this respect should Red Sea route be closed.
