# 457 Mr J. McEwen, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr M. Akiyama, Japanese Consul-General in Australia

## Letter MELBOURNE, 28 June 1940

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 27th [1], in regard to the Japanese Government looking after Italian interests in Australia, and to inform you that the Commonwealth Government has no objection to this arrangement.

This letter will also serve to confirm the verbal understanding with the Secretary of the Department [2] and your Consulate- General that the formal handing over will take place this afternoon, June 28th. To this end, instructions have been issued to the Defence and other authorities to take note of and to facilitate the arrangements made.

I might add that my Department will be only too pleased to confer with you on any questions which arise out of your representation of Italian interests.

J. MC EWEN
