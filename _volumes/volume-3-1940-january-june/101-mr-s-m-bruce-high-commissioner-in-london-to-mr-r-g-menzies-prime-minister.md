# 101 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 181 LONDON, 14 March 1940, 8.40 p.m.

MOST SECRET FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Dominions Office telegram No. 74. [1] Appears clear if Japan is to be prevented from obtaining footing in Timor, will be necessary to buy Wittouck [2] out. Information here indicates that Oil Concessions Ltd. prepared to find substantial sum with this object and Dutch apparently prepared to co-operate. I have arranged for meeting at the Foreign Office beginning of next week to discuss the whole position, at which Lord Cadman [3] will be present as I feel if any British financial participation it should be through Anglo-Iranian Company and possibly Commonwealth Oil Refineries.

Please advise me your views.
