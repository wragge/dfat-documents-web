# 179 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 280 LONDON, 27 April 1940, 12.30 a.m.

FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY

In my view seriousness of Norwegian situation and its repercussions cannot be exaggerated as I can see no alternative in face of present position to immediate withdrawal of all Allied forces with exception of those in Narvik area. I need not stress secrecy of above opinion.

BRUCE
