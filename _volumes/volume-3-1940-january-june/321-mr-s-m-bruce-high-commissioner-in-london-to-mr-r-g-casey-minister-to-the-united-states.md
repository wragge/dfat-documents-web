# 321 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 16 LONDON, 31 May 1940, 10 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR MR CASEY HIMSELF PERSONALLY

Your telegram No. 29. [2]

Halifax [3] asked me to convey his appreciation of your presentation of position [to] Sumner Welles [4] which he considers admirable.

As I felt effect might be prejudiced if (it was) thought here your action has been prompted by me, I substituted in second paragraph for reference to my opinion 'my information was that opinion was strongly held'.

I also eliminated third paragraph as I felt it would be considered particularly by the Prime Minister [5] too defeatist and would prevent cable receiving consideration it deserves.

_

1 Although received in the Legation at this time, the cablegram was not delivered to Casey until 9.30 a.m. on 1 June 1940.

2 Document 319.

3 U.K. Foreign Secretary.

4 U.S. Under-Secretary of State.

5 Winston S. Churchill.
