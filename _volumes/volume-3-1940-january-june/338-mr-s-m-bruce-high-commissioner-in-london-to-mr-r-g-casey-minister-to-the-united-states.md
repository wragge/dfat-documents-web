# 338 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 17 LONDON, 4 June 1940, 9.05 p.m.

PERSONAL FOR CASEY

Prime Minister [1] asked me at length to convey a message to you saying how admirable he thought your presentation of the position to Welles was. [2] He stressed the necessity of not allowing the President to think that whatever happened the British Fleet would be transferred across the Atlantic.

1 Winston S. Churchill.
