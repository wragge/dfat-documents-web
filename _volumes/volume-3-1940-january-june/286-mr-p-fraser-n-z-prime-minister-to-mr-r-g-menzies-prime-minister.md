# 286 Mr P. Fraser, N.Z. Prime Minister, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered WELLINGTON, 27 May 1940, 7.47 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

I thank you for your telegram of May 27th [1] and would be grateful if you could see your way to ask Mr Casey [2] to deliver to President Roosevelt the following message from me.

Begins:

In view of the very critical situation that has developed on the Western Front, I have felt I might be justified in addressing you Mister President directly and personally. The people of New Zealand look upon the United States of America as one great and powerful nation not engaged in the present struggle which is still a bulwark of freedom, justice and democracy, all of which are today in such deadly peril. It is far from my thoughts to endeavour to persuade you or the American people to a course which is not entirely consonant with American interests and American policy but we feel you as well as ourselves are vitally concerned that democracy shall not perish from the earth, and we should like you to know how greatly at this juncture we should welcome any support which United States of America might think possible to extend to help the British Commonwealth and its allies in the desperate fight we are waging. [3]

P. FRASER
