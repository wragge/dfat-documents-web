# 230 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 316 LONDON, 11 May 1940, 6.29 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY

Announcement of main Cabinet appointments likely tonight. Small War Cabinet of five probable. The Prime Minister [1] remaining Minister of Defence, Chamberlain Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons. Halifax remains at the Foreign Office. Eden leaving the Dominions Office and I fear may become Secretary of State for Air: I trust not as he is not strong enough and has not the necessary drive.

BRUCE

_

1 Winston S. Churchill.
