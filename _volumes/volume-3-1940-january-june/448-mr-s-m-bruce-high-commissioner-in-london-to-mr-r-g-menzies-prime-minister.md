# 448 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram [481] [1] LONDON, 26 June 1940, 8.42 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Dominions Office telegram No. 157. [2]

Definite decision taken to go to any lengths to obtain possession or prevent falling into enemy hands the Richelieu, Jean Bart and units at Oran. Prospects of success good as to the former but Oran forces doubtful. Understood that Duff Cooper [3] and Government arrived in Morocco but no information yet received.

Latest reports from French North African Colonies show hesitancy and divided counsels and my own impression is that there is little prospect of stimulating them to continued resistance.

Despite pressure promised appreciation of Mediterranean and Middle East not yet available.

BRUCE
