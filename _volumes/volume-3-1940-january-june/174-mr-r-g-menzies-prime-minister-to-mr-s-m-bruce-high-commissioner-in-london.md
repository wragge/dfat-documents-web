# 174 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 24 April 1940,

MOST SECRET

It is presumed you have seen Dominions Office telegram D. 123 [1] regarding interception and diversion ships for Vladivostock and my reply 153 of 15th April and 155 of 17th April. [2]

We were concerned at statement in D. 123 'orders have been sent to Commander China station to intercept' which largely influenced terms of our reply. Telegram D.O.107 of 20th April [3] however reads 'orders which had been prepared to issue etc.' We cannot but regard with concern the grave discrepancy in these statements. We do not propose to communicate direct with United Kingdom Government on this point, but suggest you raise it informally with view to ensuring we obtain correct appreciation of the stage which has in fact been reached in regard to proposals or action of important moment to us.
