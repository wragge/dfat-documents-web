# 291 Mr J. McEwen, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

## Cablegram 63 28 May 1940,

Reference telegram No 98 of May 28 [1] I think it advisable that you return to Washington immediately and remain during the forthcoming critical period. The idea and belief of the Prime Minister [2] was that you would communicate his message personally to the President [3] and support it with your own representations.

It is felt that an indirect communication loses its intended effect and it is desired you ask an interview immediately you return to supplement and support the Prime Minister's message.
