# 75 Prime Minister's Department to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

## Cablegram unnumbered 23 February 1940,

WOOL FOR JAPAN

We have no desire create embarrassment in United Kingdom relations with United States but we must again emphasize our special interest in the adoption of a more active policy in sales to neutrals. We must ask that United Kingdom Government, during forthcoming discussions, keep constantly before them our special position vis-a-vis Japan and necessity to avoid embarrassment to us except for the most vital Empire reasons.

Have noted United Kingdom assent to arrangement with Japan till end April.

Central Wool Committee have made some progress in persuading Japanese to take merino wool without reduction total monthly purchase.
