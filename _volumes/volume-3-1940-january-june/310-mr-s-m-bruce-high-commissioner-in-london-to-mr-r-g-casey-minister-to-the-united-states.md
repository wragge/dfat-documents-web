# 310 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 15 LONDON, n.d.

PERSONAL FOR CASEY

I am sending copies of two cables I have sent the Prime Minister.

[2]

I doubt whether the U.K. Govt. will take action on my suggestion.

They would I think respond to an initiative from (? the Commonwealth Govt).

Possibly also you can (? do) (en masse?) something with the United States authorities.

Action by United States might stiffen French whose morale I feel will sooner or later inevitably go.
