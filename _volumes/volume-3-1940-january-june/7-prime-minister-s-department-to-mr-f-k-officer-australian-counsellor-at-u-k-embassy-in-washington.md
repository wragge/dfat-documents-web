# 7 Prime Minister's Department to Mr F. K. Officer, Australian Counsellor at U.K. Embassy in Washington

## Cablegram unnumbered 8 January 1940,

Following message to be released to Press at 10.30 p.m. Australian 

time 8/1/40.

Broadcast by the Prime Minister [1] regarding the appointment of a 

Minister to Washington.

'I am taking this opportunity as Prime Minister of Australia to 

tell you that arrangements have just been completed for an 

exchange of diplomatic Ministers between the United States of 

America and Australia. The first Australian Minister, who will 

leave shortly to take up his appointment, is the Rt. Hon. Richard 

Gardiner Casey, at present Minister for Supply and Development in 

the Australian Government and formerly Treasurer or Chief Finance 

Minister.

This is the first time that Australia has made a full diplomatic 

appointment to a foreign country and the event is therefore of 

great historic interest to us. We have for a long time felt that 

the problems which concern the nations surrounding the Pacific 

Ocean are of special and vital interest to Australia and that as 

an independent nation within the British family of nations we 

might quite reasonably expect to play an effective part in the 

development and strengthening of peaceful contacts between all the 

Pacific Powers.

I may say that we have under immediate consideration the question 

of diplomatic representation at Tokyo: but our first appointment 

has been made to the United States of America because, as a 

British community, we feel that we have a great deal in common 

with the United States and that by closer contact with them we may 

contribute to a fuller understanding between the English-speaking 

peoples of the world and, through that fuller understanding, to 

the peace and well-being of the world.

The United States of America has no aggressive designs against any 

other country. Neither has the British Empire. We have the same 

general ideas of Government: we attach the same supreme importance 

to the liberty of the individual: we have in common the conviction 

that the proper object of all Governments is to forward the 

happiness of ordinary men and women and not merely of a chosen 

few. And we are the better able to exchange our ideas and to 

forward our ideals by joint effort because we speak the same 

language and share the same literature.

I say to you quite frankly that Australia attaches importance to 

have [sic] the friendship of the United States and is prepared to 

do much to improve it. But may I also say that I believe that the 

friendship of Australia as an integral part of the British Empire 

is of importance to the United States. The British and American 

peoples have too much in common and, may I add, too many precious 

ideas at risk in this turbulent world, not to realise that, 

whatever their organic relation may be, they are both exercising 

similar functions and that the safety and development of each is 

of profound importance to the other.

Reciprocally with our own action, the United States Government has 

agreed to establish a Legation at Canberra. [2] The American 

Minister will be the first person to be diplomatically accredited 

to Australia. Housed at Canberra, he will become for all 

Australians the living embodiment of a gesture of friendship and 

recognition by the United States. You may ask why, when there is a 

British Ambassador at Washington, it is thought necessary to 

appoint an Australian Minister. Somebody may say to you that this 

sort of thing indicates that the various British nations are 

falling out with each other. Nothing could be further from the 

truth. The presence of an Australian Minister at Washington, so 

far from weakening the position of the British Empire at that 

capital, will strengthen it. Each British Dominion brings to the 

British Empire not only unswerving loyalty to His Majesty the King 

as the centre of that Empire, but also its own special knowledge 

born of its own conditions. Just as we enjoy great privileges as 

members of the British Empire, so we are subject to great 

responsibilities. We must each play our own part. Just as we feel 

that we are contributing effectively towards the future peace of 

the world by sending Australian sailors and soldiers and airmen to 

fight in Europe, so do we believe that by increasing our 

diplomatic contacts around the Pacific, we will be contributing 

powerfully towards that common understanding without which 

permanent peace is impossible.

Mr. Casey is uncommonly well qualified to fill the distinguished 

office to which he has been appointed. He served throughout the 

last war, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the 

Military Cross. For some years after the war he returned to his 

profession as an engineer and was indeed for some time in the 

United States. He was for some years Liaison Officer in London 

between the Commonwealth Government and the British Cabinet 

Secretariat of the Foreign Office [sic]. His experience in this 

way has made him very widely known in British political and 

official circles.

For the last seven years Mr. Casey has been one of the most 

influential members of the Australian Government, exhibiting in 

the complex financial and business matters with which he has had 

to deal the highest qualities of capacity, energy and patriotism.

Less than a month ago he returned from London where he represented 

Australia at a series of brief but important discussions on war 

problems. He will thus go to Washington exceedingly well informed 

on a great variety of matters.

I am quite sure that he will prove not only a distinguished 

representative of his own country, but a real contributor to the 

achievement of those national ideals to which I have referred.

If there is one thing that I believe most sincerely, it is that we 

must all get to know one another better if the future of the world 

is to be a peaceful future. The business of diplomacy is not a 

mere business of dexterity in negotiation. Its real purpose is to 

remove misunderstandings, not to create them. Its real 

justification is peace.' [3]

2 The first U.S. Minister to Australia, Clarence E. Gauss, 

presented his credentials on 17 July 1940.

Commissioner in London, and to Lt Col E. E. Longfield Lloyd, 

Government Commissioner in Japan.
