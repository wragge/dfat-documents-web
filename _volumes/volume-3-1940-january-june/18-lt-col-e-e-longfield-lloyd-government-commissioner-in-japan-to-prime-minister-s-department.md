# 18 Lt Col E. E. Longfield Lloyd, Government Commissioner in Japan, to Prime Minister's Department

## Cablegram unnumbered TOKYO, 15 January 1940, 1.41 p.m.

During the last few days Japanese Press has been widely referring to Australian Press reports that Commonwealth Government intends to appoint Minister to Japan before Easter, and one prominent journal (after consultation with the Foreign Office so we learn) has published a leading article inter alia. mentioning such appointment as refuted by the idea alleged to be conveyed by the Washington Press cables to Tokio that recent Australian exchange of Minister[s] with the United States is part of a joint restraining movement against Japan in the Southern Pacific. Whilst the article commends the Legation idea it also includes a thrust at Australia's immigration policy and goes on to suggest the desirability of far more congenial general atmosphere between the two countries.
