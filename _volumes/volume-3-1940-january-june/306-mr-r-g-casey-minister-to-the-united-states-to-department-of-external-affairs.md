Cablegram 102 WASHINGTON, 29 May 1940

SECRET

My telegram No 96. [1]

Recently in reply to a direct question President [2] told Lord Lothian [3] that with the present situation in Europe he did not believe the United States public would agree to go to war with Japan to defend the Netherlands East Indies. The U.S. Government would rely on other means of pressure to prevent a Japanese attack.
