# 82 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Dr C. J. Pao, Chinese Consul-General in Australia

## Letter MELBOURNE, 28 February 1940

I have your letter of 22nd February [1] and sincerely appreciate the cordial relations between our Governments and your readiness to collaborate with Australia in Pacific problems.

I can assure you that the whole question of diplomatic representatives to Pacific nations is being most sympathetically examined by my Government.

The various aspects to which you refer will not be overlooked, and as soon as I am able to make a definite statement I shall advise you.

[R. G. MENZIES]
