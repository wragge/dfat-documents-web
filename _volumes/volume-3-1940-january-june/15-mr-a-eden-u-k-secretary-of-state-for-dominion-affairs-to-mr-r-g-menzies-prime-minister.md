# 15 Mr A. Eden, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Circular cablegram D18 LONDON, 12 January 1940, 10.55 p.m.

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

Following for the Prime Minister, begins:-

Consideration has recently been given to the desirability of 

issuing, on some suitable occasion, a joint Anglo-French 

declaration engaging not to conclude a separate Peace. It has been 

[ascertained] [1] that the French Government are in favour of this 

proposal which it is thought would be of value primarily from a 

psychological point of view and for countering German propaganda 

designed to drive a wedge between the Allies.

2\. A draft declaration has been prepared in the following form:-

'The undersigned duly authorised thereto by their respective 

Governments declare as follows:-

The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland and the Government of the French Republic mutually 

undertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate 

nor conclude an armistice or Treaty of Peace except by mutual 

agreement.'

3\. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would be glad to 

learn whether His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of 

Australia would wish to be associated with such a declaration. In 

that event it is suggested that the following wording should be 

substituted at the beginning of the second Sentence:-

'The Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, the Commonwealth 

of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa and the 

Government of the French Republic.'

4\. It will be observed that the draft set out in paragraph two 

above does not exclude the possibility of separate agreements 

being concluded by each of Dominion Governments but it is 

unnecessary to emphasise the enhanced effect of the solidarity 

which would result from joint signature by five of His Majesty's 

Governments.

5\. The Government of India are being consulted as to whether they 

would wish to be included.
