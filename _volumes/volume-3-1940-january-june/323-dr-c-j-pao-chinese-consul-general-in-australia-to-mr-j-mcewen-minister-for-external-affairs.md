# 323 Dr C. J. Pao, Chinese Consul-General in Australia, to Mr J. McEwen, Minister for External Affairs

## Letter SYDNEY, 1 June 1940

I have the honour to advise that I received on May 30th, 1940, a cable from my Government instructing me to convey to His Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth of Australia that it is China's desire that the traditional cordial relations between our two countries should be developed, not only for mutual benefits but for the advancement of civilization of mankind. I am further instructed that China would welcome an early exchange of diplomatic representatives between our two countries. They point out the Far East policy of Great Britain and Australia, and that it would hardly be in accord with such principle of justice and goodwill as expressed in that policy, should Australia exchange diplomatic representatives with Japan without simultaneously adopting a similar step with China.

If so, it is possible or likely that the enemy of democratic nations in the Pacific will deliberately create fabrications so as to jeopardise the good relations between Australia and China which could otherwise constitute a cornerstone of peace with justice in that region. On behalf of my Government I extended to your Government my congratulations for your success in arranging the exchange of diplomatic representatives with the United States of America. [1] The success of a similar plan between Australia and China will mean much more than a better understanding between our two peoples.

I can assure you that my Government would immediately reciprocate if Australia appoints a Minister to China, and that it would give every facility and extend every courtesy for your establishment of such a post.

Your consideration and advice will be deeply appreciated.

C. J. PAO
