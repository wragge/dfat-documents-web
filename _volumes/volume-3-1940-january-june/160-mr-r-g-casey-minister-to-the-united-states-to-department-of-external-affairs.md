## Cablegram 62 WASHINGTON, [18 April 1940] [1], 5.30 p.m.

Your telegram No. 40 [2] delayed in decoding. Lothian [3] who had not received any instructions mentioned subject to Mr. Hull [4] yesterday was referred for an answer to statement dealt with in my telegram No. 61 [5] which was in terms I had anticipated and which you will have received through the press. I propose to watch reaction in Congress and press before asking to see the Secretary of State in a day or so. Meanwhile you may wish to let me have your views on the United States statement.
