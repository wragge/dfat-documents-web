# 189 Prime Minister's Department to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

## Cablegram unnumbered 30 April 1940,

B.B.C. short wave broadcast Sunday, April 28th, included announcement that QUEEN MARY and AQUITANIA had arrived Capetown.

In view present location of these liners [1], such broadcasts must raise grave doubts reliability B.B.C. news, especially in Australia. This announcement also cabled to Australian press after having been passed by London censor.

We can only infer that B.B.C. being used by Admiralty for its own purpose but result is questioning by Australians of authenticity of British broadcasts and endless trouble for censorship authorities.

Incident indicates reversal British policy outlined your telegram April 12th [2], in which it is stated that the intention is that any news of arrival at or departure from ports within the jurisdiction of Allied censorship should be rigorously suppressed.

Impossible enforce this policy here if B.B.C. continues to issue bulletins concerning these liners.
