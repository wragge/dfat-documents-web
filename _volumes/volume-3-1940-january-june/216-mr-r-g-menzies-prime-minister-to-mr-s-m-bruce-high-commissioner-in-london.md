# 216 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 8 May 1940,

SECRET

Regarding wool and other primary products which are subjects of sale to Great Britain, and also Shipping, I propose to send McBride [1] to London with suitable assistants and possibly Owen Dixon [2] who has been advising Wool Committee.

My reason is that there is good deal of criticism at this end which I think cannot be adequately met unless we can show that we have done everything possible to eliminate the causes of criticism.

Unnecessary for me to say that your own efforts fully appreciated by us but you will at once realise the political significance of sending a special delegation in matters of such moment to Australian pastoralists and farmers.

We have not received any reply regarding our desire for direct representation with Ministry for Economic Warfare. [3] We attach great importance to this. I am considering whether it might not be a good thing to get a man of the standing of Owen Dixon to go to London for this purpose.

Would be grateful if you could let me have your comments as early as possible.

MENZIES
