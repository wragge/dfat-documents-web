## Cablegram 264 LONDON, 23 April 1940, 12.47 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER URGENT

ANZAC DAY. General Freyburg [1] has sent a friendly message to Marshal Chakmak Chief of the Turkish General Staff at Ankara who has replied. These messages will be published in both Turkish and New Zealand orders of the day on 25th April and read out to the troops. Turkish Embassy here are very gratified by the message and have intimated that they would be glad to carry out the same procedure with Australians. Feel that this is most desirable suggest steps be taken for immediate message to Marshal Chakmak.

If you approve would be glad of your advice that message has been sent so that I can advise Turkish Embassy.
