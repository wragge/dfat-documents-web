# 316 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Cablegram 105 WASHINGTON, 30 May 1940, 9.12 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

Interview with Sumner Welles reported in my telegram 106 [1] was result of Bruce's views in his telegrams 365 and 366. [2]

I agree with him that the French Government-Smuts proposal is unwise but I think his suggestion number (3) regarding a conference is premature.

I told Welles of my recommending you to press for Bruce to be made member of the British War Cabinet. [3] He agrees wholeheartedly and says it would have extremely good effect in this country where faith in British War Cabinet is not great. Fact also of Australia having direct voice would be very well taken here. [4]
