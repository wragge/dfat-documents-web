# 33 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 71 LONDON, 26 January 1940, 7.06 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

SCANDINAVIA. Long meeting last night with the Prime Minister [1] and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [2], when the whole question exhaustively examined. Am confident as a result Narvik action will be dropped and consequently the review foreshadowed my telegram No. 63 [3] will not be forthcoming.

At the meeting was agreed that stoppage of supplies of iron ore to Germany would be a major war objective but that no really effective action could be taken without the co-operation of Sweden.

Position will be watched with a view to being prepared to act immediately should favourable opportunity occur and in the meantime the Chiefs of Staff are collaborating with regard to necessary plans and preparations.
