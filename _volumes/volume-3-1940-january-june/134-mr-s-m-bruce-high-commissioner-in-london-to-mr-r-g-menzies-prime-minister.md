MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF MOST SECRET

Am having greatest difficulty in obtaining clear appreciation of the position. High Commissioners had meeting with Eden [1] this morning at which obtained no definite information and further meeting being held as soon as War Cabinet, which is now sitting, rises. Contradictory reports being received as to whether Norwegians negotiating with the Germans. Also reports of R.A.F.

bombing Bergen and of naval engagements but no information of results. In attempt to get some appreciation have run out the following summary and questionnaire which am sending for what it is worth-end of Part I. Part II follows in immediately following telegram.
