# 212 War Cabinet Minute

## Minute 260 CANBERRA, 7 May 1940

AGENDUM No. 96/1940 AND SUPPLEMENT No. 1, AGENDUM No. 97/1940

STRATEGICAL APPRECIATION CONSEQUENT UPON ITALY'S POSSIBLE ENTRY INTO THE WAR AND ROUTE AND DESTINATION OF A.I.F. CONVOYS

(previous reference-War Cabinet Minute No. (257) [1])

The consideration of these Agenda [2] was preceded by a general discussion on the international situation and war policy. It was generally agreed that, arising from recent events in Norway and the possible entry of Italy into the war on the side of Germany, a vital need existed for a more positive and active diplomacy by Britain and France in neutral countries, particularly those in the Balkan and Mediterranean regions. The present was considered an appropriate opportunity for urgent and suitable representations to be made to the United Kingdom Government on the subject by the Prime Minister. [3]

Further discussion was deferred until the next meeting.
