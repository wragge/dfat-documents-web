# 353 Mr W. S. Churchill, U.K. Prime Minister, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Circular cablegram D245 LONDON, 10 June 1940, 1.25 p.m.

MOST SECRET [FOLLOWING FROM PRIME MINISTER FOR PRIME MINISTER] [1]

In view of recent events, we have come to the conclusion that there is little prospect of arranging for a meeting here of Prime Ministers this summer. But we will continue to keep in mind the possibility of such a meeting hereafter if the situation should so develop as to afford occasion for reopening the question. In the meantime, I look forward of course to the closest contact and co- operation with you and the other Prime Ministers through existing machinery.
