# 2 Note by Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, of Meeting of Dominion High Commissioners

## Extract LONDON, 2 January 1940

After we had dealt with the ordinary questions which arose, I 

raised the question of the alteration in the instructions to 

Lothian [1] with regard to his attitude towards the Zionists in 

the United States of America. I pointed out that very definite 

instructions had been sent to Lothian with which I was in full 

accord, telling him that the British Government adhered entirely 

to the White Paper, but that these instructions had been 

countermanded by a cable dated Christmas Day which told him that a 

decision as to the Government's policy would probably not be 

arrived at for a period of a week.

I asked whether this portended a change in the Government's policy 

and that if it meant any yielding to Jewish pressure to the 

detriment of the Arabs, there would be the strongest objections 

from Australia.

Anthony [2] was obviously slightly embarrassed that I had got on 

to this point and gave a somewhat shuffling explanation to the 

effect that when the matter had been discussed in the Cabinet some 

members felt that the instructions sent to Lothian went rather 

beyond the policy laid down in the White Paper. The point at issue 

apparently being with regard to land sales. He told us that 

Malcolm [3] had attended the War Cabinet and explained the 

position and that the matter was still under consideration.

I reiterated my point that any selling of the Arabs under pressure 

from the Jews would cause considerable trouble with Australia and 

Anthony said that he would speak to the Foreign Office about the 

matter.

I then raised the question of the Dominions Office letter [4] 

dealing with the exchange of letters between Halifax [5] and 

Benes. [6] I pointed out that what had been done appeared to me to 

be a reversal of policy and that this was so was borne out by 

O'Malley's [7] telegram from Hungary specifically stating that a 

change of policy had taken place.

I pointed out that the press section of the Foreign Office had 

been very insistent a few weeks ago that there should be no 

reference to Czecho-Slovakia, but that we should talk about 

Bohemian and Moravian protectorates.

The statement in Halifax's letter that His Majesty's Government 

recognise that the Committee is qualified to represent the Czecho-

Slovak people appeared to be a reversal of the previous attitude. 

Anthony clearly had little knowledge and no views on the matter 

and it was left that he was to speak to the Foreign Office about 

it.

We then had a discussion as to what attitude should be adopted by 

the Dominions with regard to the Benes request for recognition of 

his Committee by the Dominions. We decided the best course would 

be that Benes should be told that the Dominion High Commissioners 

would be prepared to see him and discuss the matter.
