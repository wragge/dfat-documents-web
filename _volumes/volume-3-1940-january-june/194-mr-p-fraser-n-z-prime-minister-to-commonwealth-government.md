# 194 Mr P. Fraser, N.Z. Prime Minister, to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram unnumbered WELLINGTON, 1 May 1940, 4.04 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

New Zealand Government have considered the situation as set out in Secretary of State's Most Secret and Most Immediate telegram of 30th April which has been repeated to you as number 129. [1] They are in general agreement with the measures suggested in that telegram and they propose to act accordingly. Before, however, advising His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to that effect, they would be grateful to know the views of His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. In view of the fact that the convoy is due to sail 2nd May a very early reply would be appreciated.
