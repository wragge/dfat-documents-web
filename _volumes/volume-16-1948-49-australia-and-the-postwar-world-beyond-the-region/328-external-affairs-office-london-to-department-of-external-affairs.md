# 328 External Affairs Office, London, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 734, LONDON, 1 March 1948, 5.26 p.m.

SECRET

Your telegram 188 19th January.

Commonwealth Relations Office telegraphing, probably 1st March regarding sixteen nation meeting on 15th March.[1] After discussion with Walker, I have raised again question of facilities for observation and have been assured that United Kingdom Delegation will keep Walker or other Australian Representative fully informed. Question of formal recognition of Australian observer, however, would raise some problems in relation to other countries for example South America which are of economic importance to Western Europe.

2\. Grateful for further instructions if you wish more formal arrangements made.

_ [1] A meeting of the sixteen member countries of the CEEC.
