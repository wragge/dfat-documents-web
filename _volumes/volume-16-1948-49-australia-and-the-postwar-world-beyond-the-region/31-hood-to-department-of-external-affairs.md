# 31 Hood to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN340, NEW YORK, 18 April, 1948, 8.29 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET CONFIDENTIAL

PALESTINE From Hood. Reference my immediately preceding telegram.

1\. After early preamble resolution would proceed.

'Having taken note of the stated intention of the mandatory power to divest itself of administrative responsibility in Palestine after 15th May, and Recognising that circumstances beyond its control have prevented Palestine Commission from adhering to the prescribed schedules of stages of implementation of the Assembly resolution of November 29th 1947, Reaffirm principle of its resolution of November 29th 1947 in favour of the establishment of independent Jewish and Arab States in Palestine[1], Requests the Palestine Commission:-

(a) To proceed immediately with the creation of provisional council of Government and local militia forces, in co-operation with the respective communities concerned, in the prescribed areas of Palestine.

(b) To assume as from May 15th, in co-operation with one or both of the provisional councils of Government, civil administration in the relevant area or areas of Palestine.

(c) To carry through, in co-operation with one or both of the provisional councils of Government, the remaining stages after May 15th prescribed in the Assembly resolution of November 29th 1947.

Calls on the States of the Arab League to prohibit their nationals from engaging in activities in Palestine designed to obstruct the carrying out of the Assembly resolution of November 29th 1947.

Calls on states, members of the United Nations, to [refrain from furnishing aid or encouragement to either community in Palestine which is acting without][2] the sanction of the Palestine Commission and in [obstruction of] the terms of the [General] Assembly resolution of November 29th 1947.'[3]

_ [1] Hood subsequently deleted this paragraph because potential supporters urged that 'it would be inadvisable at this stage to include explicit reaffirmation' of the resolution. See cablegram UN357, dispatched 21 April 1948.

[2] Words in square brackets accord with Hood's rewording conveyed to External Affairs in cablegram UN357, dispatched 21 April 1948.

[3] Hood tabled the proposed resolution in the First Committee on 22 April 1948. It was never discussed in committee and Hood withdrew it when the committee passed the resolution summarised in Document 40, note 1.
