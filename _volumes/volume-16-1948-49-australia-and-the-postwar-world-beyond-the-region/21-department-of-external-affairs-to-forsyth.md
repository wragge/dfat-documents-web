# 21 Department of External Affairs to Forsyth

Cablegram 158, CANBERRA, 24 March 1948

SECRET

You should oppose any new move to adjourn or postpone discussions in Trusteeship Council in Jerusalem. In every matter you should act on the assumption that the Assembly decision is to be implemented until the Assembly itself makes a contrary direction.

2\. Please report on the attitude of delegates to the proposal to call a special Assembly. The Minister's statement cabled to you should be given a widespread distribution as an indication of Australian policy. In fact, it might be appropriate to send it to all members of the Security Council as well as to other members who supported the proposal.
