# 336 Department of External Affairs to Heydon

## Cablegram 1503, CANBERRA, 3 May 1948

Please see 1345 from Nimmo to Treasury. This is a matter of great political concern. Convenience in gathering information is secondary consideration to matter of policy in respect of our position in E.R.P. and Customs Union. All these Western European moves have been made without our concurrence and in fact, usually without our knowledge and against our better judgement. While criticism has been avoided, equally concurrence or any move of direct association must be avoided. Please see Minister's speech in House in relation to relief. It is most embarrassing to have opinion transmitted on technical basis on a political matter without also opinion on political aspects.[1]

_ [1] In a letter to Nimmo dated 12 May 1948, Wheeler commented that Evatt was 'unfavourable to participation' in the proposed committee.
