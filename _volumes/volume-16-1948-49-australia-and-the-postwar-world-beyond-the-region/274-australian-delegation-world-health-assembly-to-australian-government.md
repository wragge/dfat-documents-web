# 274 Australian Delegation, World Health Assembly, to Australian Government

## Cablegram 3, ROME, 25 June 1949, 10.30 a.m.

The Philippines today raised the question of the Western Pacific region and asked Australia and New Zealand to state their views. The Australian Representative said Australia would co-operate fully with the Philippines along with other neighbours in matters of common concern in the field of health but discussions would have to proceed on what were matters of common concern and the best methods of co-operation, e.g. appropriateness of regional organisation, its geographical scope and the appropriate time to establish it. New Zealand followed with a statement along similar lines. Bulgaria said it was proper to raise the question but it should be put on the agenda of the Third Health Assembly in view of the present uncertain political situation in Indonesia and other territories. The Committee decided to note the Philippine proposal and it was the general understanding that the Director General could if he wished consult Nations in the region. Your telegram No. 5[1] did not arrive until after the item was completed. Philippines speech was in very vague terms and contained no specific proposal.
