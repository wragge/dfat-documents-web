2\. The General Assembly, mindful of the basic objectives of the Trusteeship system, noting that some of the Trusteeship Agreements authorise customs, fiscal or Administrative Unions, recalling the approval of the Assembly after assurances from Administrative Powers, having considered the observations of the Trusteeship Council reference to Administrative Union, endorses the Trusteeship Council's conclusions reference the Administrative Union of New Guinea and Papua and Inter-territorial organisation of East Africa with regard to Tanganyika, is of the opinion that the establishment of the Unions raises questions of fundamental importance reference the political status of the territories and the attainment of the objectives of the Trusteeship system, recommends accordingly that the Trusteeship Council should - (a) Investigate the questions generally in all their aspects with special reference to such Unions already existing or proposed and in the light of the forms of the Trusteeship Agreements and assurances given by the Administrative Authorities in this connection.

(b) In the light of this investigation recommend such safeguards as the Council may deem necessary to preserve the distinct political status of the trust territories and to enable the Trusteeship Council to effectively exercise supervisory functions over such territories.
