# 170 Department of External Affairs to Shaw

Cablegram 221, CANBERRA, 19 July 1949, 3.30 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

Korea.

Your telegram 282 has been most helpful 2. At this stage we feel that report should confine itself to conclusions. Recommendations, if any, might be contained in a supplementary report to be circulated to member Governments early in September. This would give more time for consideration and consultation with other Governments if desired and recommendations would relate more immediately to the situation existing at time of Assembly discussions. We are discussing question of recommendations with Minister and will advise later.

3\. Conclusions should cover points set out in your telegram in paragraphs 1 to 4 of Section [D] and paragraphs 1 and 2 of your Section E.

4\. We are not clear on paras 4 and 5 of your Section E. Full commission must remain in Seoul until and unless Assembly takes contrary decision.

5\. Your final para. We see no reason to alter present arrangement whereby Jamieson as your alternate acts as delegate during your absence from Seoul.
