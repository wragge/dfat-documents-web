# 224 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 373, CANBERRA, 6 August 1949, 10.15 a.m.

RESTRICTED

Your 438 and 444.[1]

1\. It would seem undesirable for Interim Committee to which several member states have not appointed representatives to make recommendations as to its own continuance.

2\. It might be useful if at next session of Assembly President were authorised to consult with member states not represented on Committee to see whether agreement is possible on re-constituted committee which would (a) serve as a Standing Committee of the Whole with time-saving functions in connection with the preparation of the agenda of regular session;

(b) carry out non-contentious assignments allotted by General Assembly;

(c) deal definitively with international conventions of a political character.

3\. If Committee is nevertheless determined to make recommendation on question of continuance please explore these views informally and report reaction.[2]

_ [1] Cablegram UN444, dispatched 4 August 1949, sought comments upon the continuation of the Committee.

[2] The delegation reported that it found considerable support for the views when it put them forward in committee on 10 August 1949.
