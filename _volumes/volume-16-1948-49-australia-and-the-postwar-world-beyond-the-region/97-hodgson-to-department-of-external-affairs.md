# 97 Hodgson to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 65, GENEVA[1], 12 June 1948, 11.55 a.m.

SECRET

Factual survey nearing completion and Committee will proceed to discussion on conclusions next week. It has been generally agreed that recommendations should be left for final report before Assembly meets, as recommendations at this stage may prove premature in light of changing conditions and circumstances.

Further close consideration by Governments of main report with conclusions so far reached will enable them better to make up their minds on best solution for this problem. We shall give our views later on this. Agreement on Part I of report dealing with creation and organisation of U.N.S.C.O.B. and Part II (efforts to achieve conciliation) should be relatively easy but Part III is very contentious and we find ourselves constantly in opposition to the United Kingdom and United States whose constant object seems to be to prove guilt of three Northern neighbours. We even have to fight loaded meetings such as co-operation of Greece and non co-operation of Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

We have insisted that main role of U.N.S.C.O.B. was to observe and record and not to investigate and condemn especially on indirect evidence.

However we shall reserve our position on Part III until Committee considers conclusions drawn from this part. We may have to recommend to you that we put in a dissent[ing] report on this part. Our insistence on main role of conciliation has weak support from few delegations only and we may get Brazil and Pakistan to go along with us if minority report seems necessary.
