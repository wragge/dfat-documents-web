# 359 Heydon to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 3206, LONDON, 14 September 1948, 6.20 p.m.

SECRET

Your telegram 3501 - Italian Colonies.

Minister decided that we should formally register our position with the Council of Foreign Ministers and accordingly the following telegram was, last night, despatched by the High Commissioner who has signed all correspondence regarding Italian Colonies to the Chairman of the Council of Foreign Minister as follows - 'On 6th August, 1948, I communicated to Deputies of Foreign Minister for former Italian Colonies certain views of the Australian Government.[1]

My letter included specific request that Deputies reports and recommendations be communicated to interested Governments in good time and reminded the Deputies of the right of the Australian Government to present its views directly to the Council itself.

The Deputies declined to communicate their recommendations to the interested Governments.

My Government now requests the Council to communicate these recommendations to it and other interested Governments as soon as possible.

I am also authorised to enquire when Australia will be afforded an opportunity of presenting its views to the Council.' 2. If meeting goes on and has real discussion we should be able to present views.
