3\. Committee [One] unanimously adopted the Australian resolution that Greece, Albania, Bulgaria meet to seek agreement on methods and procedures for solving their difference. Two amendments were adopted by Committee. First adds Chairman and Rapporteur of the First Committee to the convenors. Second makes it clear that the four convenors will act in the capacity of conciliators. It is an important achievement to have secured both Greek and Soviet group support for this attempt to solve some of the differences.[2]
