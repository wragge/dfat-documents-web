# 56 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 144 (extract), PARIS, 29 October 1948, 8.37 p.m.

SECRET

3\. There is strong emotional support in the Committee for adequate emergency action and considerable objection to mixing political and relief aspects of Palestinian problem although some emphasis has been laid on importance of earliest political solution in Committee One and Security Council. Debate will continue 30th October and may conclude on same day. We will of course make no commitment on behalf of Australia. We feel however that any very critical attitude by Australia would be misunderstood and we would be unsuccessful in pressing political aspects of problem. Suggest that best line we can adopt in the circumstances is lend support to New Zealand and Polish arguments to stress importance of Arab countries maintaining and extending their own relief and to raise for consideration question of universal scale being adopted as a target for contributions. While proposal to draw upon working capital fund is not favoured by a number of Committee members they are somewhat at a loss to answer the question where to find immediate funds which may be necessary. We could suggest that gifts of supplies would reduce drain on working capital fund and that countries with dollar resources might provide necessary dollars for immediate requirements.[1]

4\. Would appreciate your urgent comments.

_ [1] The delegation made a statement in committee the following day elaborating these points and those in Document 55.
