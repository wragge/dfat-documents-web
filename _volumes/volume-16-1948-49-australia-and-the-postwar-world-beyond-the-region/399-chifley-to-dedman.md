# 399 Chifley to Dedman

Cablegram H22, CANBERRA, 20 January 1948, 4.55 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your W.41. I have examined the compromise texts cabled in your W.41 and would be reasonably satisfied with something along these lines. Your revised text of Article 21(2)(b) is regarded as meeting our position very satisfactorily. Your revised text of 24(2) is an improvement on the original but still falls short of what we would like. Nevertheless it could be accepted if your redraft of 21(2)(b) is acceptable to Clayton.
