# 404 Cabinet Sub-Committee on Trade and Employment Conference to Australian Delegation, Havana

## Cablegram p6, CANBERRA, 11 March 1948, 4.50 p.m.

Your W137.

In view of the position the Conference has reached and the apparent impossibility at this stage of securing any further improvement the Government does not insist on the matter being re-opened but this does not mean that the text is acceptable. It will reconsider the question along with other issues when it deals with the full Havana text.[1]
