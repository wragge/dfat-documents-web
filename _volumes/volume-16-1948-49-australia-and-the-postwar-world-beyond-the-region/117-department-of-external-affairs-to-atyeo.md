Cablegram 25, CANBERRA, 26 July 1949, 9 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

As you yourself propose, conclusions should be confined as far as possible to statements of facts and should avoid judgments and recommendations which are properly the prerogative of the Assembly. Your efforts should in general be directed to securing moderate report having regard especially to relations with Yugoslavia.
