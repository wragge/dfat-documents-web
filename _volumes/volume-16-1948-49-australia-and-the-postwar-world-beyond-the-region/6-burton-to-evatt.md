# 6 Burton to Evatt

## Cablegram E35, CANBERRA, 31 August 1948, 5.15 a.m.

Following is a summary of the latest information re Presidency showing the attitude of member states:

The three Scandinavian countries were approached in Canberra. Norway on principle will not commit its Delegation but Government views Minister's nomination most favourably. Argentina will support in the preliminary meeting of South American States to be held immediately before the General Assembly.

Brazil will support subject to reservation on France.

Nehru[1] is favourable but no firm decision will be made by India until the Indian Delegation reaches Paris. India is not otherwise committed.

Pakistan has given no committal but will base its election policy on the outcome of proceedings of the British Commonwealth meetings before the Assembly. The Secretary of Foreign Affairs in Pakistan has stated it would be difficult to persuade the Arab states to give support.

Siam. The matter is to be discussed in Siamese Cabinet and a decision is expected shortly.

China will support unless they believe that they should give support to a French candidate. China apparently considered standing itself but in view of your candidature will not now nominate.

The following is relevant to Arab States. Bernadotte[2] in message of 26th August expressed his gratitude for rapid and generous response of Government to appeal for relief for refugees in Palestine and neighbouring countries. Iran has made approach through London seeking support for election to Economic and Social Council and International Court. No reply has been despatched from here.

_ [1] Jawaharlal Nehru, Indian Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations.

[2] Count Folke Bernadotte, United Nations Mediator in Palestine.
