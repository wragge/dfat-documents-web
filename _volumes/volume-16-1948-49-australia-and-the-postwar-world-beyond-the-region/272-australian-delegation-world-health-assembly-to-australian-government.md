# 272 Australian Delegation, World Health Assembly, to Australian Government

Cablegram 2, ROME, 20 June 1949, 11.50 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Philippines stated in the Assembly[1], Australia and New Zealand not disposed to collaborate in the establishment of regional organisation. Have now requested that establishment consideration be placed on the Agenda. Informally approached by Director-General if we object to establishment of Manila excluding Australia and New Zealand. Have discussed with New Zealand Delegate. Propose suggest deferment of establishment and consideration of needs by the Executive Board after investigation in view of cost, the unsettled state of the Far East and limited number of countries involved.

2\. Please advise urgently.
