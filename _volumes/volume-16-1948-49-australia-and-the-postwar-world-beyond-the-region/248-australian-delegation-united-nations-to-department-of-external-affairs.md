4\. That, in addition, action is needed to overcome unemployment and under-employment such as that arising, particularly in under-developed countries, among large numbers of people engaged in agricultural pursuits; and that, to this end, it is necessary inter alia to stimulate the economic development of under-developed countries;

5\. That the objectives of international agreements for the furtherance of the production and consumption of, and expansion of international trade in goods on as free as possible a basis would be seriously impaired by failure to take or by delay in taking action designed to maintain full and productive employment especially in those countries which have an important share in world trade;

6\. That a high and stable level of international investment, particularly in under-developed areas of the world, would contribute materially to the realization of those objectives;

NOTES WITH SATISFACTION 7.

The intention of the Economic and Social Council to study further the related questions of measures to achieve full employment and to encourage international investment;

9\. RECOMMENDS that each Government consider, as a matter of urgency, its international responsibility under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter to take actions as the need arises, designed to promote and maintain full and productive employment, through measures appropriate to its political, economic and social institutions;

10\. REQUESTS the Economic and Social Council during its consideration of full employment and economic development to give attention to unemployment and under-employment, especially in under-developed countries and particularly in such critical fields as agriculture; and 11. DECIDES that the world economic situation be reviewed again at the next session of the General Assembly in the light of Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter.'[2]
