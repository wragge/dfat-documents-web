# 295 Burton to Watt

Cablegram 128, CANBERRA, 10 August 1948

PERSONAL

Your personal letter 23rd. The reason why you have received no information is that I do not know the answers, which makes all the more important, if he is agreeable, a conversation in person with the Minister. I do not think you can expect any guidance at the moment, and meanwhile you need not think that any information you cable is waste. Continue to cable what you can glean whether you consider it fits in with thought here or not.
