# 366 Makin to Chifley

Cablegram 953, WASHINGTON, 19 August 1948, 2.30 p.m.

TOP SECRET

Senator Armstrong[1] has suggested that he should take opportunity while in United States to have discussions with Forrestal[2] on question of security of information and U.S. attitude. He is very concerned about the position as it appears from London.

2\. I myself am even more worried than when I cabled you in London on this matter (my 38 to Crotonate).[3] Reports have appeared in U.S. press of controversy in Australia over CSIR and secrecy of research, including references to talks by you in London.[4] In spite of excellent statement by Mr. Dedman on 29th July I fear publicity may have further alarmed U.S. authorities. In any event there is no indication in Washington of any modification in attitude towards our Service representatives.

3\. It would be most helpful if you could let me know the results of any discussion you may have had in London, and any facts which might tend to reassure U.S.

_ [1] Senator J.I. Armstrong, Minister for Supply and Development.

[2] James Forrestal, US Secretary of Defense. Resigned March 1949.
