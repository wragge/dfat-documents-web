# 294 Burton to Beasley

Cablegram 2967, CANBERRA, 7 August 1948

TOP SECRET

MOSCOW TALKS ON GERMANY We have had no information from the United Kingdom as to progress or subjects discussed. Since these discussions are of utmost importance, it would seem most extraordinary that Australia has not been kept informed and an opportunity given for comment if we so desire. Please take matter up informally and advise.
