# 155 Department of External Affairs to United States Embassy

## Note, CANBERRA, 16 August 1948

The Department of External Affairs presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America and has the honour to refer to its Note No. 27 dated 12th August, 1948, concerning the proposed announcement by the Department of State on American policy in respect to the new Korean Government.

The Department notes that it is proposed to appoint the Honorable J. J. Muccio, with the personal rank of Ambassador, to negotiate with the new Government set up in South Korea. The Department regards this action of the United States as one for itself alone and not concerned with the activities of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea as this Commission was set up to deal only with a National Government if it were possible for one to be elected.

The Department is of opinion that in view of the circumstances that have arisen in Korea the sole remaining function of the Temporary Commission is to report to the General Assembly shortly to meet in Paris. Until such time, any further action by the Australian Government in relation to the Government of South Korea will be deferred.
