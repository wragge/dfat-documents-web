# 146 Mission in Tokyo to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 240, TOKYO, 4 May 1948, 4.40 a.m.

SECRET

Your 159.

Korean Commission decided to observe elections by five votes to nil; France, Canada and Syria abstaining. Jackson voted in favour of observing elections, which decision was arrived at on the grounds that, 'there exists a reasonable degree of free atmosphere in which Democratic rights of freedom of speech, press and Assembly are recognised and respected'.

In telephonic conversation on 1st May, Jackson informed me that the situation was 'much better' and that the authorities were very traitorous.[1] I expected to obtain his views on our future course of action today.[2]

_ [1] The copy on the file is annotated: 'Surely not the right word?'.

[2] A further annotation (by Shann) reads: 'Mr Throssell I should say that our future course of action is determined by the manner in which Jackson has voted'.
