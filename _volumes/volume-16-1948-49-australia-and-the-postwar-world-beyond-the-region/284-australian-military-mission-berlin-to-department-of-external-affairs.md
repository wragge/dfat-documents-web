# 284 Australian Military Mission, Berlin, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram AMM633, BERLIN, 18 June 1948

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

The Soviet Commander in Chief informed today that currency reform will be introduced in Western Zones on Sunday June 20th. Will not apply to Western sector Berlin. Sixty old Mark may be exchanged at parity, remainder blocked and to be released at one for ten later on. I anticipate distinct hardening of Soviet attitude on the ground that Berlin must be protected against black market trading from the West.

Mr. Steel[1] informed me this afternoon that he considers (a) Control Council meeting likely.

(b) French anxious for one.

_ [1] Christopher Steel, Head, Political Division, Allied Control Commission for Germany.
