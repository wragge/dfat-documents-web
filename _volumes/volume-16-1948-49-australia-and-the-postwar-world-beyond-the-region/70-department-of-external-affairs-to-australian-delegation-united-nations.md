# 70 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 124, CANBERRA, 3 March 1949, 3.40 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

PALESTINE RELIEF Government has decided to make available 1,000 tons of flour for shipment as soon as possible.[1] Australia will pay freight to destination.

For your own information enquiries from Relief Director indicated lack as yet of willingness on the part of some members of United Nations to assume an equitable share of the burden of relief. It was therefore felt that until a more substantial response is made from other countries able to help, we should not at this stage supply the full 6,000 tons requested but await the development of the appeal. Value of gift is about ï¿½A50,000 including freight.

_ 1 Cabinet agendum 1574, dated 25 February 1949, was discussed and approved by Cabinet on 1 March 1949.
