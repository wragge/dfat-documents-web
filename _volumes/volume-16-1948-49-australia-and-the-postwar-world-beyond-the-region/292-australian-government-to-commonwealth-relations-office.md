## Cablegram 198, CANBERRA, 3 August 1948, 11.35 p.m.

The Commonwealth Government decided today to offer to the British Government the use of 10 Douglas Dakota aircraft to assist in the air lift to Berlin if required. If this offer is accepted by your Government the aircraft will be flown by R.A.A.F. crews to Britain where the use to which the aircraft are put will be determined by your authorities.
