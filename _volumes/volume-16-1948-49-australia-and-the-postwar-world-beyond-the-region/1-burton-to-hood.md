# 1 Burton to Hood

Cablegram 283, CANBERRA, 17 June 1948, 12 noon

PERSONAL

Please see Lie at once and give him the following confidential message from the Minister. The matter is of great importance to Australia and you should use special care in handling it.

'At Lake Success last year after my narrow defeat by Aranha, you indicated your desire that I should become President of the next Assembly, asking me to let you know in good time. Hood now tells me of possible other candidates.

As you know, I took the initiative in the final decision favouring Paris location and I feel that it would be only fair and just for me to obtain election on this occasion. I believe that Aranha and many others would help. I also believe that the matter is largely in your hands. Above all, I do not desire to be put in the invidious position created last year through no fault of my own.

I would be glad to receive confidential advice from you through Hood who has my entire confidence.

Sincerest greetings. Evatt.'
