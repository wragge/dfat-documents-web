# 290 COMMENTS TO PRESS BY ANTHONY

NAA:A1838, 727/4/2 PART 12 

London, 27 June 1971

Douglas Anthony, Australia’s Deputy Premier, said today that in its negotiations to enter the Common Market Britain had failed to keep its promise to Australia.

Britain had apparently ‘washed its hands’ to [sic] responsibility for Australia’s social problems, Anthony told newsmen at Heathrow Airport where he was leaving for Washington, DC for two days of talks on US–Australian trade relations.

‘We had asked for a transitional period for our butter and sugar, yet nothing is going to be done’, he said. ‘We did not come here as a bleating child holding on to a mother’s apron string.’

‘We can stand up for ourselves, but a promise was given to us and it has not been fulfilled. I am wondering what we can trust in what is said to us’, Anthony said.

He said his 10-day trip to Britain had apparently made no impression on the effects Britain’s entry to the Common Market would have on Australia’s rural community.

There seemed to be no determination by Britain to push Australia’s case, he said.

‘I cannot see much hope for the Commonwealth if this is to be the approach’, the Deputy Premier added.
