# 375 NOTE FOR FILE BY BUNTING

NAA: Al209, 1971/9449 PART 1

Canberra, 11 August 1971

The Prime Minister telephoned me—12 July.

2\. He said, as his annotation shows, that he had not given any policy direction that Australia House is to be transferred to Foreign Affairs. My minute was therefore, he believed, wrongly based.

3\. He said he would need a new submission which went into the pros and cons of transfer and led up to a recommendation.
