Submission No. 493—Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy

The Cabinet noted the report by the Defence Committee on the strategic basis of Australian defence policy. 1 It subscribes to the general view brought out by the report that a further substantial deterioration in Australia’s strategic position has taken place.

2\. In discussing the final section of the report dealing with the general strategic concept, the Cabinet noted, and endorsed, the statement in paragraph 70 of the situations short of limited war for which Australia should be prepared to provide forces without prejudice to a limited war capability. It also noted, and also endorsed, the policy statement set out in paragraph 65 concerning the maintenance of a forward defence policy and readiness to respond to Indonesian policies and activities.

3\. However, while noting and endorsing these particular matters, and noting also paragraph 74, it raised for consideration the question whether the possibility of Australian forces being required to act without the assistance of United States armed forces against Indonesian activities in Papua New Guinea is sufficiently recognized and sufficiently provided for in military planning.
