# 113 MINUTE, LAWLER TO MCMAHON

NAA:A5882, CO1191

Canberra, 9 June 1971

Secret

_The Prime Minister_

Attached is a draft Decision on the Strategic Basis Submission.2

2\. The Decision has been written in very brief form—both Mr. Bailey and I feeling that the outcome of the discussion required this. However, I think it is a case where we should have your reaction before proceeding to any circulation.

3\. I raise another point with you. The Cabinet discussion reflected a strong feeling that the orientation of Australia’s defence policies should be sustained much as it is at present. This being so it is important that the officials concerned with the development of the defence programme and force structures should be clear as to the position. I would propose that we should be in touch with Sir Richard Randall, Mr. Shann and Sir Arthur Tange3 with a view to ensuring that the position is comprehended.

1 P.J. Lawler, Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

2 The draft became the decision—see Document 112.

3 Sir Richard Randall (Secretary to the Treasury), Keith Shann (Deputy Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs), Sir Arthur Tange (Secretary, Department of Defence).
