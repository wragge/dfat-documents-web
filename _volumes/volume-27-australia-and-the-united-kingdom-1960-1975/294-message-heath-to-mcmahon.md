# 294 MESSAGE, HEATH TO MCMAHON

NAA: Al838, 727/4/2 PART 15 

London, 7 July 1971

Personal And Confidential

I am sending this personal message to let you know that Her Majesty’s Government have decided to recommend to Parliament that the United Kingdom should join the European Communities on the terms which we have negotiated. I shall be announcing this in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 7 July.

In my message to you of 2 July I dealt very fully with the aspects of our proposed entry into the Communities which are of particular concern to you. 1 I know that there have [sic] also been apprehension within the Commonwealth about the possible wider consequences of British membership of the Communities for the Commonwealth relationship. But, as I said at the meeting in Singapore,2 I believe that Britain, as a member of a larger European Community will be able to take a more effective part in the varied work and enterprises of the Commonwealth and that, while our entry will present a challenge it will also provide great opportunities. For our part, the ties of friendship and goodwill will not be weakened and the special value which we attach to the Commonwealth will be in no way diminished.

I would only add that nothing can change our sense of kinship and comradeship with Australia.
