London, undated

May it please Your Majesty I and other of your affectionate Australian subjects have served Your Majesty and the Royal Family for many generations. It is with anger and dismay that we find in the present legislation of Your Majesty’s Government the deprivation of rights which we fought for and for which many of us suffered. Your Majesty may be assured that though we may despise the self-interested cynicism of your ministers I and others will fight as bitterly for the right we are deprived of as we fought against those who are now preferred in your kingdom. I have the honour to be Your Majesty’s Retired Grenadier and obedient servant William Spowers.
