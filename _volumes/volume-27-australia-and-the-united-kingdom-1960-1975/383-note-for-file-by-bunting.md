# 383 NOTE FOR FILE BY BUNTING

NAA: A1209, 1971/9449 PART 1

Canberra, 8 May 1972

Confidential

Confidential 

I spoke to Mr Bowen in Sydney on Thursday, 4 May, about ‘the Australia House’ passage in his speech. We discussed it.

2\. I said—and he agreed—that the words ‘in this context’ are not well chosen and gave the wrong impression.

3\. I suggested that I take the paragraph away and let him know on the next day of my ideas for redrafting.

4\. He said he also would look at the words.

5\. I rang on the following day to propose the words now shown on the text.

6\. The Minister told me that he had made his own alterations and had introduced 1 July as the effective date.

7\. I said I believed there was no warrant for this. It might well tum out to be the date but I would not want it stated until I could have a discussion with the Prime Minister. This had not yet been possible.

8\. The Minister said that in the circumstances he would take the reference out but he would be speaking to the Prime Minister and may have the opportunity to raise it.

9\. I said even so, I would not want the Prime Minister to agree to it without there first being an opportunity for me to talk to him. I would not be able to do this before next week.

10\. Mr Bowen took note of my suggestions for a redraft.
