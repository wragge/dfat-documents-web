# 381 MINUTE, JAMES TO HOME

UKNA: FCO 24/1369

British High Commission, Canberra, 28 April 1972

Confidential

Sir John Bunting told me today that he expected the transfer of responsibility for Australia House from the DPMC to the DFA to be effected at an early date, possibly as soon as 1 July. Sir J. Bunting said that the DFA were pressing him to agree that they should appoint the occupants of the most senior posts in Australia House under the High Commissioner (who it was assumed would continue to be a political appointee). Sir J. Bunting said that he was determined that the senior of the two Deputy High Commissioners should be nominated by the DPMC. The other Deputy High Commissioner would be appointed by the DFA. Sir J. Bunting said this arrangement was essential in order to maintain a due share of control by DPMC over the operation of what was after all a microcosm of the Commonwealth Government here in Canberra. He added that if no such control were maintained points of importance to Anglo/Australian relations might henceforth be missed or neglected.
