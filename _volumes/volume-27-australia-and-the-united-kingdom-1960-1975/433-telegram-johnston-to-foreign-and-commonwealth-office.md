# 433 TELEGRAM JOHNSTON TO FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE

UKNA: FCO 57/231

British High Commission, Canberra, 23 February 1971

No. 275. Info Saving To Brisbane. Confidential

Appointment of Australian State Governors

The Queensland State Branch of the Australian Labor Party resolved at a recent triennial conference that the policy of the State Party be quote that the office of Governor be abolished unquote.

2\. The anomalous situation under which State Governors are appointed on your advice and using the Queen’s United Kingdom style and titles was discussed in correspondence resting with my letter 25/38 of 6 March, 19681 to Sir Morrice James at the Commonwealth Office. The conclusion at that time was in favour of letting sleeping anomalies lie. This one however has not remained sleeping.

3\. The Australian Labor Party are in opposition in Queensland and the next elections are due in 1972. They have an approximately even chance of coming into power then. We hope to hear in due course the view of the law officers of the Government of Queensland. I am however. due to pay a farewell visit to Queensland on 25 March and a question may well be put to me then. While I can always duck any such questions as hypothetical and as relating entirely to Australia’s relations with the Crown it would be useful to have any guidance you can give me.
