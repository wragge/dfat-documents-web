# 359 LETTER, KILPATRICK TO CARRINGTON

UKNA: FCO 24/1317 

Melbourne, 29 November 1972

A meeting of the National Committee of the Australia–Britain Society was held in Melbourne yesterday, and I am happy to tell you that the organization is now complete with branches formed and active in every State of Australia as well as at Canberra.

All members present at the meeting reiterated their desire and intention of doing everything in their power to improve relations between our two countries. However, concern was expressed by all members of the National Committee about the effect on Australia–Britain relations of the new British Immigration rules as tabled in the House of Commons recently, and it was the unanimous decision of the Committee that I write to you as reciprocal President of the Australia Society in Britain on this subject.

It has been noted with pleasure that Mr Carr has announced that new rules are now being drafted, and we are confident that these new rules will take fully into account the special relationship between our two countries—especially including the manifold ties of kinship.

From information given to me by the Immigration Department in Canberra there appears to be no statistics available as to the number of persons of British origin, but from the 1971 census taken in Australia, the Immigration Department estimates that the number of people who are in Australia at this time of British origin could be as high as 87%.

We trust too that the opportunity will be taken by the British Government to radically transform the present streaming arrangements for all persons entering Britain at points of entry so as to remove altogether the present invidious public system of separate entry points for persons of different national status. We realise that the British Ministers are looking afresh at the Immigration problem as a whole, which is of such close concern to all members of both our Societies, and in its wider aspect to the Commonwealth as a whole.

If we can be of any assistance to your Society in pooling your ideas and ours for consideration by the British Government as to what can be done to alleviate this grave mutual problem, we will gladly assist.

An early answer would be appreciated, and I would be grateful for your advice as to whether we may publish this letter and your reply both in Australia and in Britain.
