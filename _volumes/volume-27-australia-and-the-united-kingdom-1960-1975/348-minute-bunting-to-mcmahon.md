# 348 MINUTE, BUNTING TO MCMAHON

NAA: A1838, 67/1/3 PART 6

Canberra, 22 November 1972

Confidential

As you will have read in the Press a political controversy has developed in the House of Commons about the regulations which are due to come into force on 1 January next concerning entry into Britain. These regulations will provide practically unlimited entry for citizens of the EEC. They will however bring into operation the provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act by which Commonwealth citizens become technically aliens except those with ‘patrial’ relationship.

We have received requests from Pritchett for guidance on handling and presentation,1 e.g. the independent television news have requested permission to interview Australians inside the main reception area of Australia House. He considers that such interviews may well produce uninformed and emotional comment critical of Britain and possibly of the Australian Government.

Foreign Affairs (including Sir Keith Waller) advise that they think that the High Commission should base its position on the broad principle of maintaining a low profile in the current debate. We would agree with this since in the final analysis this is a domestic British matter. However you should know that Sir John Pagan2 seems to be of a different persuasion and considers that Australian views should be fully exposed. He apparently considers that the present situation offers the opportunity for Australia to improve the position of its citizens under the new regulations.

I am intending to say to Waller that I agree with his low key approach. This would mean saying to Pritchett in effect that the Australian Government does not want to comment.

Pritchett may want to call the Agents-General together and tell them of the Commonwealth Government’s attitude. I will encourage Waller to say to Pritchett he should have that kind of discretion. This message is for your information.
