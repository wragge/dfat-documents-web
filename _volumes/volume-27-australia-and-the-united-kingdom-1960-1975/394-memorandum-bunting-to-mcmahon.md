# 394 MEMORANDUM, BUNTING TO MCMAHON

NAA:A1209, 1971/9449 PART 2

Canberra, 14 August 1972

Confidential

This is the Australia House letter I have drafted. 1 I have made three changes from the draft you approved.

The first is to be found in the first paragraph on page 3.

This is the section on the High Commissioner.

I have used your own words on the appointment of the High Commissioner.

Then I have added to that, ‘This will involve reaching understanding with you about the lines of responsibility under which the High Commissioner would function’.

I have not had a chance to talk to the Minister about this and it would not surprise me if he, either himself or on the advice of his department, questions it.

What I have in mind is that the High Commissioner should be your man—ultimately taking his instructions from, and reporting to, you.

The second change relates to the Deputy High Commissioner. This is in the second paragraph on page 3. It follows the discussion this morning with Mr Bowen present. It leaves the matter for future determination.

The third change relates to timing. It is in the second paragraph on page 4.

The draft you approved referred to a date prior to the end of Sir Alexander Downer’s term of office—26 October. What I have now said is 2 October, which is a Monday.

I am ringing Australia House tonight to see if there is any impediment to such a date, but I expect none.

I would still prefer to leave the date flexible but for political reasons, I accept that a date is desirable.

1  Letter was sent as drafted, see Document 395.
