# 164 SPEAKING NOTES FOR HEATH IN BRUSSELS

London, 22 February 1962

Australian Participation

Sir P. Dixon1 raised at a restricted session of Deputies on 31st January the question of the Australian Government’s hope that it would be possible for them to send representatives in the role of experts and consultants when particular matters of social interest to Australia were under discussion. He explained that the Australian Government, as indeed they had themselves made clear in an aide memoire addressed to the member-states of the EEC,2 were by no means claiming to be a party to the negotiations. He also explained that in our view, as the negotiations come to deal with the possible application of various solutions to the problems which British membership of EEC would pose for Australia, there were indeed likely to be occasions when it would be of great help to us all to have the assistance of Australian experts who could indicate what the probable effects in practice on Australian trade interests of particular courses of action could be expected to be.

After some discussion it was agreed that the matter could best be looked at again at our meeting today.

I do not think I need to go over the ground again at much length. Sir P. Dixon has already explained why we support this Australian proposal and hope that it will be acceptable to you.3 I am of course entirely at your disposal to answer any questions you may wish to raise. I should just like to make two things quite clear. One is that we look on this as essentially a practical matter. We have of course studied all these questions closely ourselves. The Community Delegations and the Commission have also, as I well know, devoted much study to them. Nevertheless, I believe that there may well be times, for example in Working Parties or at Deputies’ meetings, when it would be helpful to be able to draw on the experience and detailed practical knowledge of Australian representatives. Naturally, this could only be fruitful if all the parties to the negotiations welcomed such a move. Our suggestion is that as and when such occasions arise we should propose at the particular meetings concerned that an Australian should be invited to attend; naturally, an invitation could only be extended if all those concerned were in agreement.

Secondly, it is not our suggestion, nor the Australians’, that if invited their representatives should tell us what we may or may not do; but only what the actual effect of proposed courses of action could be expected to be.

I hope that on this basis you will find this proposal acceptable.

_Notes for Supplementaries_

1\. If asked whether others will not follow, say that so far only the Australians have asked; however, it could be helpful on occasion for the same practical reasons to have others also, and in that case we should no doubt wish to suggest it.

2\. If reluctance is shown, the tactics to be followed will depend on the general atmosphere. It might be best to force the matter to a negative conclusion so as to dispose of it. If this would spoil the atmosphere for the ministerial meeting as a whole it might be better to agree not to press the matter for the time being, but to reserve the right to revert to it on particular occasions.
