Confidential

**Australia and the EEC**

The Chancellor of the Duchy has seen your proposed telegraphic reply to Sir Morrice James’s letter of 9 July to Sir Con O’Neill regarding his conversation with Mr Anthony about Australia and the EEC.[1](#f1)

Mr Rippon is not entirely happy with the line proposed in your draft. He does not want us to think in terms of these explanations and excuses for what we achieved or failed to achieve for Australia; and still less does he wish us to convey them to the High Commissioner. They would almost certainly make him apologetic in his dealings with the Australians, where we have nothing to apologise for.

Mr Rippon says that we must firmly stand by the value of the general undertakings we have secured for third countries in regard to agricultural products subject to levy, which goes wider than sugar, butter, bacon, fruit and vegetables. We must also repeat our willingness (which Mr Rippon has twice stated in the House of Commons) to have discussions at the appropriate time and level when a particular commodity seems to be threatened. Finally, Mr Rippon wishes us to stress the importance of working with the Australians on the re-negotiation of the International Sugar Agreement and on securing a World Dairy Agreement.

In these circumstances Mr Rippon would be grateful if you could recast tile draft and give the High Commissioner what would in fact be a brief for any further talks he may have with Mr Anthony. A more detailed account of the ins and outs of the May agreement could follow, as you suggest, by letter.
