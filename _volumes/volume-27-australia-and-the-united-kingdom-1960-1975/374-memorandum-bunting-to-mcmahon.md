# 374 MEMORANDUM, BUNTING TO MCMAHON

NAA:A1209, 1971/9449 PART 1

Canberra, 10 July 1971

Confidential

**Australia House1**

You will recall speaking to me and Sir Frederick Wheeler 2 about the transfer of Australia House to Foreign Affairs for administrative purposes.

2\. It was left with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet when you took over but on the basis that its transfer would be a matter for early consideration.

3\. I have had various discussions with Sir Keith Waller and Sir Frederick Wheeler.

4\. This week with Sir Keith Waller and Mr Collings as Acting Chairman of the Public Service Board we have taken the matter somewhat further.

5\. We believe it is your policy directive that Australia House should be transferred. We agree that this is the appropriate course to follow and with your approval we now propose to work actively towards that objective.

6\. As a first step we would set up an Australian Committee and a London Committee, both under the Chairmanship of the Public Service Board to advise on the administrative steps necessary.

7\. We will report progressively as the need arises.

8\. We have checked on what statutory amendments might be necessary to give effect to a simple transfer of responsibility. The check shows that no amendments would be needed to the High Commissioner Act or to the regulations under that Act. The administrative arrangements order would of course need amendment.

9\. There is a question of how soon the High Commissioner in London should be told. I would be inclined to get this done straight away—though for the moment on a basis personal and confidential to him.

1 McMahon has minuted randomly on the document: ‘Go easy!’; ‘No! Speak’; ‘No Way’; and ‘Speak Urgently’. At Paragraph 5 he notes specifically: ‘I have never given a policy directive’. 

2 Chairman, Commonwealth Public Service Board.
