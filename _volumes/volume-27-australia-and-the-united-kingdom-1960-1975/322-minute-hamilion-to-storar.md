London, 2 December 1966 

All to the good?

They are not ‘British’ —they are ‘Australians’?

1 This minute was in response to an enclosed article in the _Evening Standard_ under the headline ‘Australia Should Drop British from Passports’, I December 1966. The article was commenting on a report in Perth’s _Daily News_ criticising British immigration rules and suggesting that it was high time the word ‘British’ was removed from Australian passports. It was this latter suggestion that Hamilton was inclined to endorse in his minute.
