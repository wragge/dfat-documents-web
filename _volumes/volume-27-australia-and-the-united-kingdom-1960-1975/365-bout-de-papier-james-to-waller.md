# 365 BOUT DE PAPIER, JAMES TO WALLER

UKNA: FCO 24/1318 

British High Commission, Canberra, 20 December 1972

Confidential

My Government have asked me to seek an early interview with the Prime Minister about their desire to enter into consultation with the Australian Government on immigration matters, provided the latter agree.

2\. It will be recalled that on 22 November the House of Commons rejected the Immigration Rules which had been laid before the House in order to give effect to the 1971 Immigration Act and new obligations arising from Britain’s entry into the EEC on 1 January 1973. This rejection was primarily due to the fact that a number of Members of Parliament thought that the Rules did not adequately take into account feelings against them in Australia and New Zealand.

3\. The British Government must now present revised Rules to the House of Commons, and will wish to give assurances to the House that Australian and New Zealand interests are safeguarded. Only the Australian and New Zealand Governments can speak with authority as regards these interests. That is why British Ministers felt it necessary to undertake to have consultations with those Governments about the Immigration Rules. The British Government would be grateful to know whether—as they hope—the Australian Government are ready to hold such consultations.

4\. In the House of Commons on 22 November British Ministers referred to consultations at senior Ministerial level. One possibility therefore, if the Australian Government agreed, might be for Lord Carrington to hold consultations when he visits Australia early in 1973. But since the new Immigration Rules have to be tabled within 40 Parliamentary days from 22 November (which in practice means by about the end of January) it would be desirable for consultations to begin earlier at Official level. Hence the British Government would like to propose that Officials from London should visit Canberra early in the New Year for this purpose. The object of the Official talks would be to have preliminary exchanges of view without commitment on either side before Ministerial discussion at a later stage.

5\. In such consultations the British Government would be ready to discuss any aspect of the Rules which affect Australians, and to consider any proposals which the Australian Government might wish to put forward. In particular they would be interested to hear the views of the Australian Government on what aspects of British immigration procedures give unnecessary offence to their citizens.

6\. The term reciprocity was much used during the debate in the House of Commons. Although it is not an easy concept to define, the British Government will be examining it in more detail. They would find it most useful to know that [sic] the Australian Government think of the concept of reciprocity, and would like at the official talks in January, if the Australian Government agree to hold them, to explore in a preliminary way the practicability of schemes founded on it.

7\. The House of Commons will rise for the Christmas recess on 22 December. Ministers would like to inform the House before it rises that an approach has been made to Commonwealth Governments concerned about holding consultations.
