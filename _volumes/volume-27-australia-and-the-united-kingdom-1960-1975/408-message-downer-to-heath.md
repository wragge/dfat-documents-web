Canberra, 20 October 1972

I have been asked by my Prime Minister to send you the following message:–

(begins)

‘During our discussions in London last November I mentioned the possible transfer of responsibility for Australia House to our Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I have decided to go ahead with the transfer with effect from 1st November.

As I recall our talk, you saw no difficulties about this, but you expressed the view, with which I concurred, that despite the change in administration the British High Commissioner in Canberra should retain the right of direct access to me, and our High Commissioner to you.

You will note from my Press statement that the organisational arrangements to be made will give support to this link. I need hardly add that it is our intention that the change make no difference to the close and understanding relationship between our people and Governments.’
