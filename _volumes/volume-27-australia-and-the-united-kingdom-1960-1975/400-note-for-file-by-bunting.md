Canberra, 24 August 1972

Confidential

I rang Sir Keith Waller to tell him the subject matter of the call on me by the Ambassador of the Republic of China.

He spoke to me of this morning’s Defence Committee Meeting.

I then spoke about Australia House.

I said I had received the Minister’s letter from the Prime Minister. [1](#f1) He had given me one or two brief comments and had asked me to consider the kind of reply.

Sir Keith said the letter was Mr Bowen’s own letter, drafted in Sydney.

I said I was working for the two Ministers to come together on the points of difference.

Sir Keith said he was not hoping for this outcome. He did not want to have Australia House.
