Canberra, 3 March 1967

176\. Unclassified 

Thank you for your pleasant message which I have welcomed. My colleagues and I very much appreciated your frank and informative contribution to our Cabinet Room discussion. [1](#f1) It is good to know you took away a good impression of Australian development and optimism for our future which we share. You found here a predominantly British community proud of its history and heritage. A visit such as yours serves to keep our relations close and warm. I look forward to seeing you again whether in London or back here in Australia. Sincerely reciprocating your regards.
