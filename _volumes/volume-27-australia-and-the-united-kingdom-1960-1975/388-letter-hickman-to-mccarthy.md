# 388 LETTER, HICKMAN TO MCCARTHY

UKNA: FCO 24/1369

London, 2 June 1972

Confidential

**Aurora Australiensis**

1\. Many thanks for your letter of 26 May about this phenomenon. 1 We are indeed well aware of the friction both within Australia House between the Department of Foreign Affairs staff and other elements (not to mention the problems peculiar to the present High Commissioner) and in Canberra between the Prime Minister’s Department and the DFA. The points made to you are interesting confirmation of our general impression and some specific knowledge and I am grateful to you for taking the trouble to put them on paper.

2\. I am sure that what you say in your paragraph 2 about the line which an Australian Labour Government would take is absolutely right. In fact, however, it seems quite likely that some of these organisational changes will be made before the Federal elections due at the end of this year. One would certainly hope so, since the advent of an ALP Government after 25 years in opposition seems increasingly likely to involve some sharp changes in Australian foreign policy and it would obviously help to reduce the disturbance they may cause if the process of organisational change were to start beforehand. I suspect, however, that nothing much will happen until Sir A. Downer’s disappearance.
