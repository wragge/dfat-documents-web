# 478 LETTER HAMER TO WHITLAM

NAA: A1209, 1978/1103 PART 1

Melbourne, 20 April 1974

**Australia’s National Anthem**

I have your telex message of 18th April, 1974, containing the text of your press release of the same date, which sets out your Government’s policy on the playing of ‘Advance Australia Fair’ as the national anthem, and seeking the co-operation of the Victorian Government in the acceptance of the music.1

The attitude of the Victorian Government is that it would of course accept and implement a decision by a majority of the Australian people in favour of a new anthem, but it takes issue with the claim in your press release that the poll conducted by the Bureau of Statistics ‘clearly indicated that a majority of Australians wanted "Advance Australia Fair" as the National Anthem’. The 60,000 people polled were only given three choices, and ‘God Save the Queen’ was not one of them. We cannot regard this as a fair and representative sample of public opinion on the matter.

The words of ‘Advance Australia Fair’ are embarrassingly inept and unsuitable, and we cannot accept the statement that the words of an anthem do not matter. It is meant to be sung on appropriate occasions, and last year an extensive campaign was conducted by your Government for a suitable lyric as the first step towards a new anthem.

I would not dispute the need for some distinctive tune to signify Australia at functions such as medal presentations at Olympic or Commonwealth Games. ‘Advance Australia Fair’ would be suitable for this purpose.

However, whilst we will take note of your Government’s views for official occasions which involve the Federal Government, the Victorian Government will continue to use ‘God Save the Queen’ for official functions under its own jurisdiction, at least until such time as it can be demonstrated that a significant majority of the people desire some acceptable alternative with more appropriate words.
