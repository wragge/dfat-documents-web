**Australia House**

The Prime Minister rang.

2\. He has a letter from Foreign Affairs—the Minister. 1

3\. It deals with the question of transfer.

4\. He wants to have a look at it. He believes Foreign Affairs are too anxious.

5\. They are not to have carte blanche.

6\. I said I had not seen a copy of the letter yet. It would no doubt come over from Foreign Affairs.

7\. I am at the moment working up a paper on this kind of subject.

8\. There are various matters which will have to stay with the Prime Minister.

9\. He asked me to give him some of these.

10\. I said relations with the Palace, and relations with the Commonwealth Secretariat—which grew out of, and was still associated with, meetings of Prime Ministers.

11\. He asked me to give him a paper so he could reply.
