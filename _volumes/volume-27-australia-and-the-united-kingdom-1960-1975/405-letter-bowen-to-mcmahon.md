# 405 LETTER BOWEN TO MCMAHON

NAA: Al209, 1971/9449 PART 2

Canberra, 22 September 1972

Confidential

Thank you for your letter of 21 September about the transfer of Australia House.1

I agree with your proposal that the administration and control of Australia House should be transferred to the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1 November 1972 under the Administrative Arrangements Order.

Since the High Commissioner Act (1909–66) simply provides that the High Commissioner shall ‘carry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister respecting the commercial, financial and general interests of the Commonwealth and the States in the United Kingdom’ but does not specify which Minister is to instruct him, action under the Administrative Arrangements Order will suffice to carry out your intention that the relations between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Australia House are the same as with High Commissions and Embassies elsewhere.

I agree with your view that there is a dual relationship between Australia and Britain and that because of this, there will always be a special relationship between the Prime Minister and the High Commissioner in London.

I agree that the High Commissioner should be appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that the Deputy High Commissioner is to be appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Prime Minister.

It seems to me desirable that you and the High Commissioner should have the right of direct communication on appropriate matters, although I should like to feel that the Prime Minister could and would exercise a similar right, where appropriate, with all Australian Heads of Mission.

I note your view that the Commonwealth Secretariat was established as an instrument of the Prime Ministers’ Conference.

I agree that, in respect of all matters concerning this Conference, it is necessary for the Prime Minister’s Department to handle its activities. There are, however, many other matters dealt with by the Secretariat which it seems to me might more appropriately be co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs. However, this is a matter which can be left with the Prime Minister’s Department for the present but on which we might ask our respective Permanent Heads to advise us in six or twelve months time.

1 Document 404.
