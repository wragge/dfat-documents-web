# 384 CABLEGRAM, DOWNER TO BUNTING

NAA: M1003

Australian High Commission, London, 9 May 1972

7206\. Personal And Confidential

I noted carefully the reference in the Foreign Minister’s Statement concerning the transfer of Australia House to the Department of Foreign Affairs.

I think you know my views, but for the official record I wish to state that I disagree with what the Government is doing, and I desire to point out that although I have been the Head of this Mission for a period now approaching eight years, my views have not been solicited on this matter either by the Prime Minister or any member of the Administration at any time, nor have I been consulted.
