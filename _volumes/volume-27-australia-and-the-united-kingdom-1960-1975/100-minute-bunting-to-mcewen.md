# 100 MINUTE, BUNTING TO MCEWEN

NAA: A5882, C0344

Canberra, 6 September 1968

Top Secret 

This is the new paper on the Defence Policy.1 To read it from start to finish and take it in is the work of at least a day, and may be a good deal more. Yet I doubt if your situation allows you to spend a day on it at this stage.

2\. Therefore if I can give you a guide to its central parts, plus some comment, it might be helpful.

3\. The first 40 or so pages have their interest and importance but you can in a way regard them as stage setting. Paragraph 167 on page 43 is a recapitulation of a lot of what has gone before and is important in itself. You could begin by having a look at that. Then you can come in again at paragraph 172 and read right through to 191.

4\. And I think that’s about it.

5\. Having read it, you will want to ask yourself whether it adds up as a Defence policy. My comment is that although the idea of support and nurturing of the American alliance are to be found in what is written, it doesn’t stand out as it might. You have to look for it. Therefore you come to doubt whether it is given enough importance. My other comment is that the idea of ultimate withdrawal by Australia, which appears in the middle of paragraph 185 and also paragraph 5 of the covering Submission,2 is all very well as a policy position deep in your mind, but possibly unwise as something to be expressed. One way to hasten withdrawal is to talk about it or let it be known that you are thinking of it, however distantly. And if we show a withdrawal state of mind to the Americans, we are hardly encouraging them to stay.

6\. But having said all that, I don’t regard the report as unbalanced. Paragraphs like 177, 178, 181, and 182 show that there is no scuttle in mind.

1  See Document 99. In another minute to McEwen of the same date, Bunting added: ‘As the cards seem to be falling, you will be away when this new Defence paper gets to Cabinet. At present it looks to me as if it will be next week.

I feel that I should interpret my Cabinet Secretary duties as not merely passing you a 66 page paper when you have little opportunity to read it, but to go further and give you some guide to it, having in mind your contributions in earlier Cabinet meetings.

If what you read leads you to feel that the paper needs any stiffening or any other adjustment, you will no doubt, assuming you get the chance, send a message to the Prime Minister or some other appropriate Minister.’
