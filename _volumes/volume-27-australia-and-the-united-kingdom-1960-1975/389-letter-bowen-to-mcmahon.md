# 389 LETTER, BOWEN TO MCMAHON

NAA:Al209, 1971/9449 PART 2 

Canberra, 2 August 1972

Attached is a copy of the statement that I propose making to Parliament following your agreement that I should be in a position at the time of the opening of the Budget Session to announce the state of the transfer of responsibility for Australia House.

You agreed that the transfer should take place on 1 September or 1 October. There does not appear to be any problem in arranging for the transfer to take place on 1 September and I propose that it take effect from that date.

_Draft Statement_

_Australian High Commission—London—Transfer of Responsibility_

In presenting a statement of Australian Foreign Policy to Parliament on 9 May 1972 I made reference to the transfer of responsibility for the Australian High Commission, London, to the Department of Foreign Affairs. The transfer is imminent. Arrangements are in hand for the transfer to take place on 1 September 1972.

As no date had been set for the transfer when 1972/73 estimates were being prepared it was agreed that the Department of Prime Minister would handle with the Treasury the preparation of estimates for the Australian High Commission, London. The estimates appear in the printed estimates for that Department. It is intended that the responsibility for the funds appropriated for the operation of the Australian High Commission, London, in the 1972/73 financial year become the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
