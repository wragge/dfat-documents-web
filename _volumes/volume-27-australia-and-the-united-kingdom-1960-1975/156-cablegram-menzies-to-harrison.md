# 156 CABLEGRAM, MENZIES TO HARRISON

NAA: A1838, 727/4/2 PART 1

Canberra, 6 October 1961

3191\. Secret

The immediately following cable contains a message for Harold Macmillan on the Common Market question.

2\. The immediate need for a message arises from the fact of the meeting between the United Kingdom and the Governments of the Six in Paris next week. In view of the likelihood that the United Kingdom will be making some statements concerning our position at this meeting, we have felt it necessary to re-affirm that none of our trade interests is expendable and to make it clear that in anything that is said the way must be left open for claims to be pressed for all of them and not just for some.

3\. As you will observe, the message has been carefully drafted and is being carefully timed. I would like you to arrange for it to be sent around to Macmillan as soon as you can under cover of a formal letter of transmission from you. If possible, I would like Westerman to know its contents in advance of your sending it. We have not yet examined in detail the results of the official talks which have been taking place in London during the past fortnight since we considered it desirable to await the return of Westerman and the other members of the delegation before getting down to the detail.
