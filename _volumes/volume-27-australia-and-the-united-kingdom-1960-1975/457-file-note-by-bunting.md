# 457 FILE NOTE BY BUNTING

NAA: A1209, 1973/6398

London, 22 April 1973

Confidential

**Prime Minister–Queen Discussions**

The Prime Minister telephoned me from Windsor on 21st April, 10.00 a.m.

He referred to his discussions with the Queen on the previous evening as having been good and very friendly.

In brief the outcome was as follows:–

(a) Royal style and titles:

> (i) ‘Of Australia and her other realms and territories, Queen’
> 
> Yes, perfectly agreeable.
> 
> (ii) ‘Elizabeth’—not ‘Elizabeth 11’
> 
> Not favoured by The Queen.
> 
> (iii) ‘By the grace of God’
> 
> The Queen would wish to let it stand.
> 
> (iv) ‘Defender of the faith’
> 
> Would ‘not matter’ if it were dropped.

(b) Coinage: ‘Elizabeth’

The Prime Minister did not mention this in view of the outcome of (a) (ii) above.

(c) Renaming High Commissioners as Ambassadors

Not mentioned.

(d) Relations with the States on, e.g. appointment of Governors, award of Honours, matters about flags

Not mentioned.

(e) Letters of Credence

The Queen has a strong wish to continue signing the Letters, but would probably see no difficulty on the other aspects, e.g., the nomination of our Ambassadors and agrèment for other countries.

The Prime Minister said he was giving me this report in anticipation of my discussion later in the day with Charteris.

He imagined Charteris would have a similar report.

He would like to see what progress Charteris and I could make.
