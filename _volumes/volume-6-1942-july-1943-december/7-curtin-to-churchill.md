# 7 Curtin to Churchill

Cablegram Johcu 37 (extracts) CANBERRA, 16 July 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

1\. You will recall from cablegram No. 245 of 14th April [1] that 

the Government expressed the view that all Australian troops 

abroad should be returned to Australia, but it was prepared to 

agree to the postponement of the return of the 9th Division until 

it could be replaced in the Middle East and the necessary shipping 

could be provided.

[A statistical summary of Australian troops in the Middle East has 

been omitted.]

5\. It will be noted that the reinforcements available provide for 

only one and a half months' wastage on the basis of intense 

activity. When these are exhausted the Division, if still engaged 

in active operations, will have to be withdrawn from the line of 

battle. If it were to remain in action with units of reduced 

strength, its morale would be affected. Alternatively, it might be 

maintained at strength by breaking up units of Corps troops, Base 

and L. of C. [2] organisations. This would also create discontent.

6\. In view of the original decision for the return of the A.I.F. 

to Australia, I foresee considerable difficulties in the despatch 

of further reinforcements from Australia. Most of the A.I.F. have 

returned and are at battle stations, the two brigades from Ceylon 

are en route and the general expectation is that the 9th Division 

is also to come. Also, as stated in paragraph 5 of cablegram No. 

245, the 9th Division cannot be retained abroad indefinitely 

without its morale being affected.

7\. Notwithstanding the respite granted by the Coral Sea action, it 

is possible, though I know you do not think it probable, for Japan 

to invade Australia in force until superiority in naval and air 

power is established in the Pacific.

8\. Had Japan been an enemy in 1939, the needs of Australian 

Defence and the campaign in the Pacific would not have permitted 

troops from Australia proceeding beyond Malaya. I now think, from 

all points of view, that the concentration of the A.I.F. in 

Australia for home defence and for participation with our American 

Allies in offensive action against Japan, when this becomes 

possible, is the best manner in which we can cooperate. We are 

also continuing our part in the Empire Air Training Scheme, in 

which we have 8,000 personnel abroad. In addition, we are manning 

certain ships and supplying personnel to the Royal Navy, the 

present number being 2,700.

9\. I am putting the matter frankly to you in a personal manner. 

With the 9th Division in action the subject must arise in the 

immediate future, and I would like to have your views before it is 

considered by War Cabinet.
