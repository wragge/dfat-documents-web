# 11 Eggleston to Evatt

Letter CHUNGKING, 29 July 1942

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

I want to write you a letter somewhat more informal than the 

private and Confidential letters you have had from me. I want to 

place before you some of the unsatisfactory Conditions which exist 

in our relations with the External Affairs Department but I do not 

wish to complain as the defects which exist may be due to lack of 

staff or other war exigencies or to your disagreement with my 

ideas of what is necessary. All I want you to know is that the 

present conditions are a serious hindrance to our efficiency. I 

have watched the working of the British Embassy in its relations 

with the Foreign Office and other services and I would not rate 

the efficiency of the Foreign Office as more than sixty to seventy 

per cent but the External Affairs Department must be rated as 

lower than this. The defects may be summed up under two headings:-

(a) Absence of an efficient administrative system directed to 

supplying the needs of the Legation.

(b) Lack of imagination to realise what the needs of a legation 

are.

1\. Information

Our greatest lack is information of what is going on in Australia 

and generally of news behind the news. Our news is scanty enough 

but of confidential information we receive nothing. Some letters 

may have been miscarried but I have had no letters whatever about 

our work though many of my letters asked for answers. (I shall 

deal later with answers to cables.) This means that:-

(a) We have only a shadowy idea of Government policy.

(b) We receive little or no information of Government decisions or 

agreements made by it.

(c) When negotiations go on with the Chinese Minister in Australia 

[1] nothing is disclosed to us. As the Chinese insist on 

negotiations at both ends this is most embarrassing to us. It is 

the A.B.C. of diplomatic practice to keep ministers informed of 

these communications.

(d) We receive no confidential information as to operations in the 

Pacific Zone or as to war production. As to (b), we received in 

the last mail a table showing the arrangement for General 

MacArthur's command. I believe you will see that information on 

these points is necessary to us. It is recognised that we should 

receive much of this information and for some weeks a News 

Bulletin was sent but this comes very irregularly now, about three 

times in seven weeks and contains little besides what can be read 

in the newspapers. Frankly, Mr. Gollan's 'Austral News' in India, 

compiled from information given by the Commerce Department, is far 

more valuable to us than anything we have received from our own 

Department. He could obtain his information at a time when we were 

receiving nothing because of the non-arrival of bags.

2\. Diplomatic bags

As you probably know, for four months we received absolutely 

nothing from Australia by bag. I gather that three bags have been 

lost. Now eight bags have arrived and we are busy digesting them.

I have no doubt that the delay in the arrival of the bags was due 

to slackness on the part of the naval authorities at various 

points along the journey. When we first cabled the Department, 

they got in touch with the Navy who informed the Department that 

enquiries were being made for them at various points in the Indian 

Ocean (see Telegrams Nos. 95, 126, 133 [2]). In fact, the bags had 

never left Australia and bags from the end of January to the end 

of May were despatched about the first week in June.

These facts seem to me to entirely displace the suggestion now 

made that the bags were held for safe despatch and to indicate 

that they were probably overlooked. There was another hold-up 

after they reached India and we did not receive them until 21st 

July. After we had made enquiries through the King's Messenger 

they were suddenly released. I know that the responsibility for 

the bags is the Navy's but I suggest that the Department is 

responsible for ensuring that our wants are attended to. A system 

of receipts should be installed to prevent this sort of thing. I 

am also of the opinion that the naval officers responsible should 

be called on to explain and disciplinary action taken if they are 

at fault. I was in the Australian Headquarters during the last war 

and there was no slackness of this kind.

3\. Answers to telegrams

I have sent a list of queries made by us which have not been 

answered [3], and have received explanations [4], the chief burden 

of which is that the queries were passed on to the departments 

concerned and no reply was received. I would point out that here 

also administrative methods exist for pursuing enquiries and also 

that it is often necessary for us to know if a query is likely to 

be answered. If, for instance, we receive a request from the 

British Ambassador or a Chinese Department for information, it 

makes us look ridiculous to have to confess after weeks that no 

notice has been taken of our request. We could save some 'face' if 

we could say that the information was not available.

There is another matter on which I wish to speak. I have sent you 

a number of despatches containing my views on the issues which 

arise in this part of the field and the method by which the war 

has been conducted as shown by the evidence I have seen. [5] I 

have been very definite but I am not dogmatic in my opinions for I 

realise how cut off I am here. My views on most of these matters 

have been written without any information from outside or any 

knowledge of opinions expressed by members of the Government. 

After a close study of press articles contained in our bags which 

arrived last week, I feel that my views, or rather the views I was 

recording, have been remarkably in accord with your own. For 

instance, in the 'Sydney Bulletin' of March 4th appears your 

criticism of coordination between London, Washington and 

Australia. Shortly after this, my friend Major-General van Temmen 

[6] was in India hearing from General Wavell a similar criticism 

of the same system. This I was able to cable to you when you were 

in New York [7] and you appeared to appreciate it. [8] For these 

reasons, I would very much appreciate something from you as to 

whether after your trip you believe the points I have been 

hammering at are still important. [9] I have no doubt that a great 

many of the defects we have encountered have been cleared up in 

the new arrangements that have been made.

I have followed up the question of Imperial co-ordination for 

defence for over thirty years and it seems to me that defects in 

practice grow out of two main causes-from organisation and 

personal considerations-and the two overlap. An organisation can 

always be a facade and provide cover for powerful personalities to 

achieve their policies. Therefore, when we join war cabinets and 

other like organisations we must remember that we become 

minorities in organs dominated by others. The remedy for this is 

to strengthen the operative parts and, therefore, professional 

officers whom you send in liaison to the Chiefs-of-Staff should be 

of the highest possible calibre in character and mind, not 

juniors. They must make themselves listened to and report to the 

Australian Government if they are not. I have seen the names of 

some of the appointees and notice that this has been in your mind. 

I believe you will find that the Chiefs-of-Staff often differ from 

political heads and would like some reinforcement of their 

position but they will not take it from junior officers. Moreover, 

one of the difficulties is the pre-occupation with other theatres 

of war. I am strongly of the opinion, from what I have heard here, 

that no proper appreciations of the position in the Far East were 

made, at any rate, after the Japanese occupied Indo-China. The 

excuse was 'too busy elsewhere' but if our men were there they 

could make these appreciations and force them on the attention of 

the staffs.

Another thing to be considered is that Roosevelt is very 

autocratic and even more inclined to take matters into his own 

hands than Churchill. This is evident by the number of people who 

report to him direct. Here there are at least six about whose 

advice the Ambassador knows nothing. There are also numerous cases 

where he takes decisions and the department concerned does not 

know of them until they appear in the press.

The Washington Pacific War Council will, therefore, be dominated 

by Roosevelt and he will be guided by public opinion. American 

opinion is difficult to handle. I believe it is far more 

capricious than in Britain. The American collective mind is 

dispersed, capable of holding strongly opposed opinions at the 

same time and it is not inherently friendly, however effusive it 

may be, and is likely to be alienated by any signs of criticism on 

the one hand and of fear and panic on the other. So far as I 

understand it, the arrangement you have made with the United 

States in regard to MacArthur and his command is an excellent 

example of the right principles to apply but of course this cannot 

cover supply.

I hope you will not consider these observations out of place. I 

feel so intensely interested in these matters and have so much 

time for thought that I cannot help forming opinions.

On the personal side I have thought it my duty to say many things 

simply because I formed the opinion that so far as this part of 

the world was concerned, the British authorities were not showing 

the qualities necessary to win the war or handle the problems. It 

goes against the grain to do this because I am a devotee of the 

British way of life and have done as much as any private citizen 

of Australia to promote British and Australian collaboration, 

especially for defence. But I realise their position. The 

responsibility thrust on them in the present war has been 

stupendous and few nations who criticise them would have stood up 

to the strain. We in Australia have not been asked to take on such 

a strain and so we do not know how we would have got on. 

Personally I think we have the intensity and adaptability to play 

an effective part. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the 

British have developed a powerful system in their public life 

which is never really defined and understood but is acknowledged 

by everyone as paramount; which must not be questioned and will 

not be explained. Men are transferred into it from various strata 

of society and if, being able, they try to change it, they 

experience frustration and disappointment. The justification for 

this system is that by it the British Empire was built up but it 

seems to have crystallised and when world conditions have changed 

there is no power of adaptation.

There is evidence, too, that such a system is not effectively 

integrated; that it cannot focus effectively on the needs of the 

situation. When the Germans attacked the Russians the British had 

twelve months to formulate their re-actions to the world 

situation, decide on their strategic positions and make 

dispositions accordingly. This was never done. I find no evidence 

of any intensive brainwork on the problems of Hongkong, Malaya and 

Burma or the Far East generally, or any clear theory as to how to 

tackle the problems which would arise in these places when the war 

broke out. The tendency to say 'Singapore will do the trick' was 

universal. As you know, there were many in Australia who had a 

much more correct appreciation than that. The worst feature about 

the position was that the British authorities always declared to 

us that the preparations in the Far East were adequate and 

afterwards said it was impossible to hold their strong points. If 

you have made an effective impression on the system and given 

Australia a safe position within it, you will have earned all our 

gratitude.

I have spent the last few days in reading the Australian press and 

I must say it fills me with pessimism. I do deeply sympathise with 

the Government in having to put up with this. Few pressmen have 

constructive minds and some seem psychopathic. One would gather 

that Australia was in a state of panic and demoralisation. It is a 

very dangerous mood to create with America looking on in a 

critical frame of mind. Governments have immense responsibilities 

today and it is not fair that they should be increased by an 

irresponsible press.

We have had a month's intense heat here and are all feeling rather 

prostrated by it. Mr. Waller has been in bed the last week with 

either malaria or some kidney trouble. He is a tower of strength 

to me and I rely on him very much.

9 On 22 September Evatt dispatched a cablegram to Eggleston 

expressing his appreciation of the latter's work in Chungking and 

of his views on the higher direction of the war, which were close 

to those of Curtin and Evatt himself; for this reason it had been 

decided to keep Eggleston in China rather than appoint him as 

Minister to the Soviet Union. Evatt also undertook to improve mail 

and information services to the Legation and pointed out that the 

External Affairs Dept had had no recent contacts of political 

importance with the Chinese Legation in Australia. See cablegram
