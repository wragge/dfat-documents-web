# 1 Evatt to Stirling

Cablegram 226 CANBERRA, 2 July 1942

SECRET

Please have the following message transmitted to the British 

Ambassador, Kuibyshev. [1] Begins:-

Would be glad if you would communicate personally following 

message to M. Molotov [2] from me:-

While in London in May you will recall I discussed with you and 

your Ambassador in London the completion of an agreement in 

principle for the exchange of diplomatic representatives between 

the Soviet and the Commonwealth. You will recall in this 

connection that you expressed yourself as personally favourable to 

the agreement but desired the matter to wait until you could 

obtain approval from M. Stalin. In our view the time has now come 

for the announcement of an agreement in principle for exchange of 

ministers following the example of Canada leaving the question of 

appointment etc. to be determined later. I hope you will treat 

this as an earnest of our desire for continuance of present 

cordial relationships between our countries. It is many months 

since we first suggested exchange and further delay would be a 

matter for regret. I trust Your Excellency would be good enough to 

regard this matter as one deserving of your early consideration. 

[3] With kindest regards and best wishes.
