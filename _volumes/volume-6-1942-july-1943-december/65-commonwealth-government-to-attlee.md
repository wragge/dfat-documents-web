SECRET IMMEDIATE

Your telegrams Circular D.418, 419, 420 and 428. [2] As already indicated, His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is in agreement with the relinquishment of extra- territorial rights in China and proposes to negotiate a separate agreement on the subject with the Chinese Government. [3]

nor is it proposed to raise the question of negotiation of a general commercial treaty in the immediate future.

Article 8 provided that the United Kingdom and China should negotiate 'a comprehensive modern Treaty or Treaties of commerce, navigation and Consular rights', the negotiations to be begun at the request of either party 'or in any case within six months after cessation of hostilities in ... which they are both now engaged'.
