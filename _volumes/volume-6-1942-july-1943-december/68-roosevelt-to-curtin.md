# 68 Roosevelt to Curtin

Dispatch [310740] [1] WASHINGTON, [28 October 1942, 7.30 p.m.]

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL MOST IMMEDIATE

I have carefully reviewed your letter regarding the Strength of armed forces in Australia which was presented to me through the Department of State on 18th October, 1942. [2]

I appreciate the anxiety of your Government concerning the absence of forces in the Middle East. I am, however, convinced that our common cause can best be served if the 9th A.I.F. Division is allowed to remain in the Middle East.

I realize of course that the message to me was a copy of a similar message to Prime Minister Churchill and I am aware that his answer to you may be from an entirely different point of view. [3] However I am prepared to offer a means to ameliorate not only Australia's present position but the position in that area of the United Nations as well.

It will be possible to despatch a United States division to Australia from Hawaii. This is a readjustment in the Pacific which I feel is justified in the existing situation. However it must be appreciated that the situation may develop in such a manner as to require the diversion of this additional division for Australia to another locality within the South or South-West Pacific Areas where its employment will be of greater advantage to the defence of Australia.

I assume that sending this division will obviate the necessity for the Australian War Council to call back the 9th A.I.F. Division from the Middle East. I cannot too strongly stress that leaving the 9th A.I.F. Division in the Middle East will best serve our common cause.

3 In fact Churchill did not reply directly to cablegram 461 (Document 62). On 2 November Bruce advised that the U.K. Chiefs of Staff had deferred action on the return of the 9th Division until the Commonwealth Govt's reaction to Roosevelt's message was known.
