# 315 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 207[A] LONDON, 26 October 1943, 9.15 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY

While I fully appreciate the importance of the questions which you feel preclude your leaving Australia before April next [1], it is desirable that I should let you know how I see the position as viewed from this end of the world.

The pace of events in Europe, both military and political, is quickening almost every day and I believe that over the next 3 or 4 months fundamental decisions will have to be taken that will profoundly affect the conduct of the war and will shape the whole future course of the world.

In these decisions Australia is vitally concerned and it is essential that she should have a voice in shaping them. Her influence however can only be effective if you yourself can come here and, with your personal position and authority as the Prime Minister, express the views of Australia.

Even if a meeting of Empire Prime Ministers was not contemplated, I would still urge that you should come here before the end of the present year, so that by personal contact with Churchill you could influence United Kingdom policy in the right direction. The presence of Smuts, Mackenzie King and Fraser, if his health permits, would enable you to influence the policy of the Empire as a whole.

Weighing what I am convinced you could do here against the great value of your presence in Australia over the next few months, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the greatest service you could render to Australia, to the Empire and to the world would be to come. Forgive my importuning you in this way but I believe you know me well enough to realise that I am doing it because I feel deeply.

BRUCE
