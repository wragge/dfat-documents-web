# 340 Cranborne to Curtin

Circular cablegram D1046 LONDON, 1 December 1943, 1.10 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

My immediately preceding telegram. [1]

Draft public communique:-

'President Roosevelt, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek [2], Prime Minister Churchill together with their respective military and diplomatic advisers have completed a conference in North Africa.

[3] The following general statement was issued-

"The several military missions have agreed upon future military operations against Japan. The three great Allies express their resolve to bring unrelenting pressure against their brutal enemies by sea, land and air. This pressure is already rising.

The three great Allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan. They covet no gain for themselves and have no thought of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa and Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.

With these objects in view the three Allies, in harmony with those United Nations at war with Japan, will continue to persevere in serious and prolonged operations necessary for the procurement of unconditional surrender of Japan."' [4]

The cablegram noted that: 'It is proposed in releasing the statement to make it clear to the press that mention of certain specific territories to be restored to China is in no way intended to imply that there is any doubt about the restoration to their former allegiance of British and Dutch territories.' 2 Chinese President.

3 The first Cairo Conference was held between 22 and 25 November.

4 It was decided at the Conference that the main focus of operations against Japan would continue to be an advance along the New Guinea-Netherlands East Indies-Philippines axis, together with concurrent operations against the Japanese mandated islands. Major amphibious operrations from South-East Asia planned for the spring of 1944 were to be postponed until after the south-west monsoon, while a decision on the nature of operations in Burma in the spring of 1944 was also deferred. This information was conveyed to Curtin in Cranborne's circular cablegram Z121 of 15 December (in FA:A3195, 1943, box, Most Secret inwards master sheets from Secdo, 1.50902).
