# 306 Churchill to Bruce

## Letter LONDON, 21 October 1943

Thank you very much for your letter of October 19. [1] I can give you an assurance that you and other Dominions representatives will be kept in touch by the Secretary of State with the developments of the Moscow Conference as closely as possible. [2] With regard to attendance at the War Cabinet, I cannot undertake to make any departure from our usual practice. I am sure you will appreciate the difficulties inherent in the situation.

WINSTON S. CHURCHILL
