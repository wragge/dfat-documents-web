# 13 Note by Bruce

## [LONDON], 30 July 1942

PROVISION OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE WAR AT SEA [1]

The Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee W.P. (42) 302 appears 

to me to be a most unsatisfactory and illogical document. It has 

all the appearance of a compromise between sharply divergent 

points of view. [2]

It is difficult to understand how the Chiefs of Staff accepted the 

compromise in face of the sombre picture they themselves draw in 

paragraph 4 of their report.

The Report was based on the strategy contained in Memorandum W.W.1 

[3], which is interpreted as requiring our commitments to be met 

in the following order of priority-

(a) Minimum necessary fighter defence for the United Kingdom.

(b) Minimum necessary allocation for securing our vital 

communications and interrupting those of the enemy.

(c) Maximum possible provision for the offensive both direct and 

in support of land operations.

With this order of priority provision for the offensive, both 

direct and indirect, insofar as it is not for the purpose of 

ensuring our vital communications and interrupting those of the 

enemy, must be subordinated to this primary objective. This means 

that the requirements of Bomber Command for the offensive on 

Germany must be regarded as subsidiary to the protection of our 

sea communications.

With this background, which is set out in their paper, the Chiefs 

of Staff make their report and submit their recommendations. A 

careful study of the report and recommendations, however, shows 

that the Chiefs of Staff have not followed the priorities laid 

down but make additional action for the defence of sea 

communications subsidiary to the requirements of Bomber Command.

There are many examples in respect to all the areas dealt with in 

the Chiefs of Staff report. The following are a few of them which 

I give to illustrate my point-

In the Home area the report states-

'The primary and immediate need is for an increased number of long 

range aircraft for anti-submarine patrols in the home area 

particularly the Bay of Biscay as well as for reconnaissance 

aircraft for work with the Home Fleet and to impose our blockade 

measures.'

As this need is for the purpose of 'securing our vital 

communications and interrupting those of the enemy' it is a first 

priority. The method proposed for meeting it, however, does not 

accord such priority. It contemplates providing a certain number 

of Lancasters. This, however, in the words of the report 'would be 

done in general at the expense of the mining effort'. The mining 

effort is similar in purpose to that for which the Lancasters 

would be made available to Coastal Command. This really means the 

robbing of Peter to pay Paul. Further-'the number of aircraft 

available each week for anti-submarine patrols from these two 

sources (i.e. Operational Training Units and Bomber Command) will 

fluctuate according to the inciden[ce] of Operational Unit 

Training Courses and the necessity for concentrating all available 

aircraft when very large scale raids are to be made on Germany'. 

This means that the availability of aircraft for 'securing our 

vital communications and interrupting those of the enemy' is 

dependent upon the requirements of Operational Training Units and 

Bomber Command.

This can hardly be said to be in accordance with the priorities 

laid down.

As a result of the proposals contained in the Chiefs of Staff 

report the hope is expressed that it may be possible 'to work up 

to a maximum of 50 sorties a week'. Can this possibly be regarded 

as a serious attempt to grapple with what is probably the most 

serious menace with which we have ever been faced?

In dealing with the Indian Ocean area the Chiefs of Staff 

'recognise the importance of meeting the requirements for 

reconnaissance and striking force in the Indian Ocean as soon as 

possible as on this will depend our ability to transfer the 

Eastern Fleet to the Pacific or elsewhere'. Nothing could be more 

important 'for securing our vital communications and interrupting 

those of the enemy' in these waters than such transfer. 

Nevertheless the Chiefs of Staff do not propose to start sending 

long range reconnaissance aircraft to Ceylon until October.

The reason for this delay appears to be a reluctance to permit 

even a temporary weakening of Bomber Command. It seems that the 

requirements of Coastal Command for long range general 

reconnaissance aircraft will not be fully supplied until October, 

and that its immediate needs will be met from time to time by 

drawing on Bomber Command. When Coastal Command's own aircraft 

eventually become available those borrowed from Bomber Command 

will have been returned-the latter Command thus remaining 

undepleted. At this stage the needs of the Indian Ocean area 

commence to be met but, I suggest, this is a complete reversal of 

the priorities upon which the Chiefs of Staff say they were 

working in preparing their report.

While others could be given the above examples are sufficient to 

illustrate my contention that the Chiefs of Staff in their 

conclusions and recommendations are in conflict with priorities 

they set out at the beginning of their paper as those under which 

they are working.

The inconsistencies I have referred to are probably due either to 

one or the other of two causes. These are that the Chiefs of Staff 

Committee being composed of men representative of different 

Services only found it possible to overcome their different points 

of view by compromise, or that the Government policy was not in 

accordance with the priorities which they had laid down in 

interpretation of Memorandum W.W.I.

Whatever the cause, I suggest that the proper approach to a 

solution would be for Cabinet formally to adopt those priorities 

and to direct that a further report be submitted in accordance 

with them. Such report should set out the whole problem and give 

all the necessary information and facts which the War Cabinet will 

require in order to arrive at its decision; it should also show, 

without regard to the effect upon our air offensive in other 

directions, what would be necessary to safeguard our sea 

communications and how rapidly those measures could be carried 

out.

Having that picture before us we can then consider the effect the 

taking of such action would have upon our offensive power, e.g. 

bombing Germany. For example, if our present plans contemplate 

bombing sorties on Germany on the scale of 1500 a week rising to 

2500 a week over the next few months, with an increasing number of 

full scale attacks of 1000 planes and over, to what extent would 

these estimates be diminished if priority were given to the 

ascertained air requirements for securing our sea communications?

My own impression is that while the scale of our offensive may 

possibly be reduced over the next few months and the point when we 

would reach our maximum effort be delayed to a certain extent, the 

reduction and delay would not be such as seriously to imperil the 

effectiveness of our efforts.

Until we have all the facts before us, however, it is impossible 

to determine what our policy should be. With the facts before us 

we can decide between the relative claims of the security of our 

sea routes and the offensive against Germany, and determine our 

policy so as to achieve the best results.

I also suggest that the question of the security of sea 

communications is of such importance to all the United Nations 

that having cleared our own minds and adjusted our own 

dispositions we should then approach the United States of America 

with a view to laying down a common policy to be implemented by a 

common effort.

I attach hereto copy of a Note which I forwarded to the Prime 

Minister on the 16th June dealing with some aspects of this 

problem. [4]

1 Bruce forwarded a copy of this paper to Bridges on 30 July with 

a request that it be distributed to members of War Cabinet (see 

letter on file AA:M100, July 1942). Under the number W.P. (42) 326 

it was discussed by War Cabinet on 12 August (see Document 21).

2 The document was indeed a compromise, reached after Portal had 

rejected an earlier report prepared by Brind and Slessor. See 

Document 5, note 1.

3 This document defined the 'beat Hitler first' strategy agreed to 

by Churchill and Roosevelt in December 1941. The text had been 

transmitted to the Commonwealth Govt in cablegram ET31 of 28 May 

(on file AA: A4764, 2).
