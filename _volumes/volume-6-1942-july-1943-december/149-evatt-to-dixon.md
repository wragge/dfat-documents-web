# 149 Evatt to Dixon

## Cablegram 308 CANBERRA, 31 March 1943

Your S.55. [1] Colonial Policy.

Your interview with Hull noted with interest.

Apart from our specific colonial interests, the course of the war in this theatre has demonstrated that the control or supervision of control over neighbouring Territories will be vital to the future security of Australia as well as to other Pacific countries; and we must have a full say in the determination of these questions. It seems to us that so far there is no clear understanding on practical application of principles; therefore any premature declaration on colonial policy may lead to misunderstanding and embarrassment. For these reasons you might inform Hull that our view is that it would be unwise to make any declaration whatever at this stage: of course I propose to discuss this question personally with you and him.

2 This cablegram crossed one from Dixon transmitting a draft 'Declaration by the United Nations on National Independence' prepared by Hull. On 5 April Evatt asked Dixon to inform Halifax and Hull that he found the draft 'very encouraging', but that he wished to suggest several amendments and hoped to discuss the matter in Washington. See Dixon's cablegram S65 and Evatt's cablegram 319 on file AA:A3300, 262.
