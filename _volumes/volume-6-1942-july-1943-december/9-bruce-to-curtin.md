# 9 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 111 [A] LONDON, 25 July 1942, 2.25 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL HIMSELF

My telegram 107 of 20th July. [1] The discussions on very high 

level referred to were with Hopkins, Marshall and King who arrived 

in this country on Friday of last week. Their presence here was 

kept a very close secret and I was specially asked to make no 

reference to it. The object of the visit was to review with the 

Government and Chiefs of Staff [here our broad] [2] strategy of 

the war.

As a result of a week of almost continuous discussions, agreement 

has been reached between the Chiefs of Staff and Marshall and King 

which will now be submitted to the President and War Cabinet here 

for confirmation.

The decisions do not involve any departure from the major 

strategic policy already agreed upon but make recommendations of 

an operational character which it is not possible for me to 

telegraph. My own impression of the decisions is that they are 

sound. [3]

The contacts which have been established by the Chiefs of Staff 

with Marshall and King during the past week will be of the utmost 

value and constitute in my view the greatest step forward that has 

yet been taken towards the establishment of Anglo-American 

strategy and operational co-operation.

In particular I am glad to say that the discussions showed a 

greater appreciation of the importance of the Pacific which is 

exemplified by the allocation to that theatre of substantial 

American Air Forces previously car-marked for the European 

theatre.

The above is of course most secret and confidential.
