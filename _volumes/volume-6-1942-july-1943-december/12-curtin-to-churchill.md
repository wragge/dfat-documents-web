# 12 Curtin to Churchill

Cablegram Johcu 38 CANBERRA, 30 July 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

With reference to Dominions Office cablegram No. 532 [1], the 

Government is appreciative of your own personal acknowledgement in 

Part 2 of the difficulties which confront it in this matter.

2\. It is frankly disappointed that the review of the Chiefs of 

Staff dwells at some length on the strategical position in the 

Middle East but does not even mention the position in the Pacific. 

We know that we can count on an understanding by you of how 

vitally important the Pacific must loom before the Australian 

Government in reaching a decision on the disposition of its 

limited forces.

3\. It can be asserted that since the outbreak of war we have never 

received from the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff an appreciation 

that has indicated a full realisation of the possibilities of the 

situation in the Pacific, either in respect of offensive action by 

Japan or offensive action by the United Nations to defeat Japan.

4\. Australia has been critically threatened on two occasions-

firstly following the fall of the Malay Barrier, and secondly 

following the threatened advance through the Coral Sea. Japan is 

now consolidating her position in New Guinea and the Solomon 

Islands and has made a landing in Papua which threatens our 

important advanced base at Port Moresby, which is vital to the 

defence of the north-eastern coast against enemy landings and the 

maintenance of the passage through Torres Strait for the supply of 

Darwin.

5\. It is imperative to force the enemy back to his bases in the 

Mandated Islands in the north-east and to drive him out of Timor 

in the north-west. The Government desires that the Commander-in-

Chief, South-West Pacific Area, shall have at his disposal for the 

defence of his base and for offensive operations in the Pacific 

all the Australian Forces it can place at his disposal. 

Furthermore, superior seapower and airpower are vital to wrest the 

initiative from Japan and are essential to assure the defensive 

position in the South-West Pacific Area.

6\. For the reasons stated, it is impossible for us to do more than 

agree to an extension of the period for the temporary retention of 

the 9th Division in the Middle East. As the Commander-in-Chief of 

the Australian Military Forces strongly advises against the 

breaking up of ancillary units for reinforcements because of the 

effect on morale, approval has been given for the despatch of two 

months' reinforcements on the average scale of activity, the total 

number being 1,989. These, with the 3,203 reinforcements recently 

available in the Middle East, will provide a total of 5,192 for 2 

1/2 months' reinforcements on the intense scale of activity. The 

Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East will therefore need to have 

these facts in mind in his use of the Division.

7\. The Commander-in-Chief, South-West Pacific Area, has had 

assigned to him all the combat naval, land and air forces of the 

Commonwealth, but we are gravely concerned about developing the 

air strength for which we are capable of providing the personnel 

and which our own advisers and the Commander-in-Chief, South-West 

Pacific Area, consider the minimum for the defence of Australia. 

This arises from the inability to obtain a definite assurance on 

the supply of equipment. The Government's willing agreement to the 

temporary retention of the 9th Division in the Middle East is 

therefore conditional on an assurance being given by the United 

Kingdom Government that, in conformity with Ismay's letter to 

Evatt [2], its representatives in Washington will be instructed to 

do their utmost to ensure the allotment of the aircraft required 

for the re-equipment of the R.A.A.F. and the provision, as 

personnel is trained and squadrons are organised, of the equipment 

required for the programme of a total of 73 squadrons by June, 

1943\. The case for equipment is supported by the fact that 7,800 

trained personnel have been sent overseas under the Empire Air 

Training Scheme. It is also desired to raise the question of the 

regular allotment to the South-West Pacific Area of Australian 

squadrons with operational experience.
