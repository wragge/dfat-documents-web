# 4 Churchill to Curtin

Cablegram Winch 25 LONDON, [11 July 1942] [1]

PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET

I am very glad that the 9th Australian Division is now in action 

in the Western Desert, and I am most thankful to you for making it 

available for this vital key point of the war.

2\. The unforeseeable tide of disaster which drove us from Gazala 

to Alamein with the loss of Tobruk and 50,000 men has now for the 

time being been stemmed. General Auchinleck has received strong 

reinforcements raising his army to 100,000 men with another 20,000 

well forward in the Delta behind them. He is thus about double 

Rommel [2] in men. He has a fair equality in artillery but is 

still somewhat weaker in armour to the enemy. This imposes 

prudence upon him for two reasons. First, a retirement is much 

worse for him than for Rommel who has nothing but deserts behind 

him and, secondly, far more strength is coming to General 

Auchinleck than to the enemy.

3\. For instance, the 8th Armoured Division with 350 Valentine 

Tanks has landed and will soon be in action. About 400 tanks of 

all natures, having been despatched before the battle began, will 

reach General Auchinleck in July and early August as replacements. 

The 44th British Infantry Divisisdon fully equipped, 15,000 strong 

with 72 guns, should have arrived by the end of July and the 51st 

British Infantry Division a month later.

4\. It was very fortunate that four months ago I obtained from 

President Roosevelt the shipping to carry an additional 40,000 men 

to the East without deciding on their destination till they 

rounded the Cape. Without these, the reinforcements now proved so 

needful by the hazards of war could not have been at hand.

5\. When in Washington, I obtained from the President 300 of the 

latest and finest tanks (Shermans) in the American Army. They were 

taken from the very hands of the American troops who eagerly 

awaited them, and were sent by special convoy direct to Suez. With 

them went one hundred 105 MM. self-propelled guns which definitely 

outmatch the 88 MM., the whole being accompanied by a large number 

of American key men. These should arrive early September. Apart 

from the 8th Armoured Division and in addition to the two armoured 

and one army tank brigades now in action forward, we have in the 

Delta the personnel of four armoured brigades awaiting re-

equipment. About half these men are desert trained in tanks. We 

should therefore be able to bring into action incomparably the 

most powerful and best trained armoured division yet seen in the 

Mid East or indeed anywhere. But I hope the issue will be decided 

in our favour earlier. This is especially desirable because of 

dangers that may, though I do not say they will, develop on the 

Northern approaches to Egypt.

6\. Scarcely less important are the air reinforcements given me by 

the President on the morrow of Tobruk. As you know we have not 

been hitherto able for technical as well as military reasons to 

provide heavy bomber squadrons for the Mid East, though they have 

often asked for them. But now the President has assigned to the 

defence of Egypt the Halpro Group of 20 Liberators which was on 

its way to India, after bombing Rumanian oilfields, 10 other 

Liberators which had already reached India and a group of 35 

Liberators from the United States. These, with our own Liberators, 

make up about 85 of these heavy bombers which should all be 

available this month. At the same time our two Halifax Squadrons 

will come into action, making up to 117 heavy bombers in all. It 

is this force I rely upon to beat up the ports of Tobruk and 

Benghazi, hampering Rommel's reinforcements, besides of course 

playing the part of a battle-fleet in preventing a seaborne 

invasion of Egypt. We have great enterprises in preparation for 

the re-victualling of Malta but as these deal with future 

operations you will not, I am sure, wish me to mention details.

In addition to the above, the President sent about 70 of his 

latest Kittyhawks across in the carrier 'Ranger' which should soon 

be reaching West Africa.

7\. Besides this, every preparation has been made to defend the 

Delta should the battles in the desert go against us. Here we have 

very large numbers of men all of whom have been ordered to take 

part in the defence of Egypt exactly as if it were England that 

was invaded. Cultivation and irrigation of the Delta make it 

literally the worst ground in the world for armoured vehicles, and 

armour as a factor would lose a great deal of its predominance. 

All ideas of evacuation have been repressed, the intention being 

to fight for every yard of ground to the end. As I have said, 

however, I do not think this situation will arise.

8\. We are having a great struggle to carry supplies to Russia. One 

fifth of the June convoy was sunk and I fear less than one half of 

the July convoy got through. The difficulties and dangers of this 

route are enormous especially during the season of perpetual 

daylight. This is serious as it is almost the only thing we can do 

for our brilliant ally who is taking so heavy a toll of Hitler's 

armies and will, I am confident, endure to the end. To show you 

what a good comrade Premier Stalin is proving himself, they have 

offered us three divisions of partly equipped Poles for the 

Levant-Caspian Theatre and have transferred to Egypt 40 Boston 

fighter bombers which were on the way to them through Basra. In 

this last matter, the President was my intermediary.

9\. The House of Commons has proved a rock in these difficult days, 

as it did in the struggle against Napoleon, and I have also been 

greatly encouraged by the goodwill of your Government and people. 

I never felt more sure that complete ultimate victory will be 

ours. But the struggle will be long and we must not relax for an 

instant. [3]

the necessity for early action and less on the growing strength of 

our position in the future'. See cablegram 104A of 14 July on file
