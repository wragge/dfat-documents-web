# 6 Dixon to Eggleston

## Letter WASHINGTON, 13 July 1942

Many thanks for your letter of 10th June [1] enclosing your letter 

to Sir Earle Page. [2]

I have never had enough information to form any reasoned judgment 

about the causes of the disasters in Singapore and Burmah and my 

instinctive forebodings springing from such isolated facts as I 

have learned from trustworthy sources are of a kind that it is 

better to suppress. In considering the Allied central organization 

for the conduct of the war, it is, I think, necessary to 

distinguish between the past and the present. Up till very 

recently London was, I believe, the centre controlling world 

strategy: now I think that it is Washington. It is here that the 

Combined Chiefs of Staff meet-and here that the order of battle 

for each theatre is settled and it is here that the primary 

allocation of the pooled production is decided and the detailed 

allocation of the United States production takes place. of course 

the Chiefs of Staff in London exert a powerful influence. I am not 

in a position to assess the part played by Roosevelt and 

Churchill.

The first I have now seen a number of times; my first-hand 

knowledge of the second is confined to one day. But I am inclined 

to the view that neither plays such an original or such a dominant 

part as in Australia we were led to suppose. When there has been 

an opposition between the professional advice of the services and 

political exigencies or considerations of a mixed nature, as in 

the cases of Greece, and of convoys to Murmansk, the decision has 

been that of the Prime Minister and the President. But I think 

that now at all events it is the professional advisers who mould 

the strategical opinion of the governments. Once a theatre of war 

is put under American control, there is a great reluctance on the 

part of the British Chiefs of Staff to raise questions about what 

is being done and this, though to a less extent, is true in the 

converse case.

To my mind the fundamental cause of all our troubles is the simple 

fact that the enemy continues to have a marked superiority in arms 

and trained troops in all theatres. The cry for aeroplanes comes 

in from every commander and day by day attempts are made to find 

planes to help this or that command or theatre. In the planning, 

how to divide a deficiency is always the question. of course 

production is expanding rapidly now.

I am by no means satisfied with the central organization for the 

control of the war on the part of the Allies, and I don't really 

know whose are the decisive minds. Indeed I cannot feel that 

operation of mind in action of which I think you are always 

conscious when powerful intelligences are directing events. Much 

of the organization is just a facade forming part of the make-

believe which democratic governments seem to find indispensable. 

But I doubt whether any attempt to improve the organization 

existing now would lead to anything more satisfactory.

There is no lack of interest either in Australia or in China. The 

President continually reverts to the question of China and T. V. 

Soong [3] is active. But it always appears to me to come back to 

the question of arms, trained troops and transport. General plans 

are, I know, made with much consideration and care though the 

soldiers seldom allow us to know with any accuracy what exactly 

they are, but the urgent necessity repeatedly arising of meeting 

desperate demands from one threatened front after another makes me 

very sceptical about the practical value of the general plans.

Naturally I feel very anxious about Australia's position. 

MacArthur's representations have some weight and so do those of 

our government, but it remains very difficult to obtain what we 

should have. We are sticking to the question and I am glad to say 

we are receiving the support of Sir John Dill who is one of the 

Combined Chiefs of Staff

I hope this letter is not too depressing but at present I feel the 

difficulties and the want of a solution.

OWEN DIXON
