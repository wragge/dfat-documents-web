# 302 Bruce to Churchill

Letter LONDON, 19 October 1943

PERSONAL HIMSELF

In view of the importance of the meetings that are just starting in Moscow [1] I would ask that I should be kept informed as to developments. I would also ask that I should be invited to attend meetings of the War Cabinet at which matters arising out of the discussions are considered.

I realise that from time to time meetings must be held designed, as you say in your letter of 6th October [2], 'to give the United Kingdom Ministers present an opportunity of clearing their own minds in the first instance on the questions at issue'. I trust, however, that in regard to non-domestic questions such meetings will not be regarded as the ordinary procedure. If they were, the result would be to nullify the arrangement reached in January 1942 between yourself and my Prime Minister that 'the Accredited Representative should have the right to be heard in the War Cabinet in the formulation and direction of policy'. [3]

As I have explained to you previously I have not found it too easy to carry out the task entrusted to me by my Government, namely, 'quietly and if possible without friction to ensure that in respect to major issues we will be fully informed and have an opportunity to express our views before decisions are taken'. [4]

May I appeal to you to lend me a hand in carrying out my somewhat difficult job.

S. M. BRUCE
