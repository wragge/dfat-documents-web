# 14 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 121[A] LONDON, 2 August 1942, 7.50 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY

My telegram S.34 of 4th June. [1] There have been developments 

during the past week of which it is desirable that I should inform 

you. After the Cabinet Meeting on Monday last, I had a short 

preliminary conversation with the Prime Minister with regard to 

our representation here. It is unnecessary to indicate the tenor 

of that conversation as subsequent developments make it clear.

On Tuesday I wrote to the Prime Minister the following letter:-

'After our meeting last night, I dictated a short note to try and 

clear my mind. Although in our conversation I said to you I did 

not think anything in writing would be helpful, on reading the 

note I am inclined to think it might be useful as a basis for 

discussion when we meet again. I accordingly enclose it herewith.'

The note referred to is contained in my immediately following 

telegram, No. 122[A]. [2]

Yesterday I had a long talk with Attlee who told me that the Prime 

Minister had shown him my note and asked him to discuss it with 

me.

As a result of that conversation I have today written to Attlee 

the

following letter [3]:-

'With reference my note to the Prime Minister of 27th July and my 

conversation with you yesterday, the position as I understand it 

is that, without any precise formula being laid down, we will 

endeavour in the light of the frank exchange of views that has 

taken place to work out in practice a mutually satisfactory 

arrangement. I realize your difficulties and you can rest assured 

that whatever I can do, consistent with my obligations to my 

Government, to help you to overcome them, I will willingly do.'

I am hopeful that it will be possible to work out the 'mutually 

satisfactory arrangement' referred to in my letter to Attlee and 

subject to any instruction from you I propose to go ahead on this 

line.
