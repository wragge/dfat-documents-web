# 2 Attlee to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 497 LONDON, 6 July 1942, 11.35 p.m.

IMMEDIATE

In order that British-Japanese exchange can take place at Lourenco 

Marques on 20th August 1942, as agreed, we have to embark Japanese 

personnel on 13th July. But this depends on the conclusion of 

negotiations with the Japanese. Only outstanding points are 

release of certain prisoners and release of Bowden and Ross. As 

only seven days remain it is now extremely urgent to clear these 

points up.

2\. It appears from my telegram No. 488 of 2nd July [1] that 

Japanese are not in fact in a position to surrender Bowden and 

there is reason for thinking that Ross may now not be in Japanese 

hands. [2] The Japanese reply to the reminder which we sent on 2nd 

July may therefore be that they are not in a position to surrender 

him either.

3\. We strongly sympathise with your desire and understand your

obligation to recover both Bowden and Ross if at all possible and 

have, as you know, backed your request with the Japanese by 

offering a substantial concession. [3] But if, as now appears very 

likely, it proves impossible for the Japanese to do what you ask, 

we should be glad to know whether you will agree to allow the 

whole exchange to take place as planned.

4\. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fears that to 

endeavour to arrange that exchange shall take place with the 

exclusion of eight official and unknown number of unofficial 

Australians and twenty-five official and thirty-one unofficial 

Japanese originating in Australia may well wreck the whole 

exchange scheme. This would mean that the repatriation of 1800 

British and Allied nationals from the Far East would be prevented. 

You will appreciate the difficulty with which we should be faced 

in relation to our own public opinion and the Allied Governments 

if the exchange broke down on such grounds, having regard to the 

doubt as to whether the Japanese are in a position to produce 

either or both of these men.

5\. In all circumstances we very much hope that, if the Japanese 

answer regarding Ross is as we fear, you will agree to proceed 

with the exchange scheme as a whole and would be most grateful for 

earliest possible indication of your views.

1 On file AA: A981, Consuls 13, ii. It conveyed a message from the 

Japanese Govt stating that V. G. Bowden (formerly Official 

Representative in Singapore) had left Singapore for the 

Netherlands East Indies at about the end of January and that his 

present whereabouts were unknown. Bowden had, in fact, left 

Singapore on 14 February with a group of refugees, but three days 

later had been captured and executed by Japanese troops on Banka 

Island. News of his death was not received in Australia until the 

end of the war. See also Documents an Australian Foreign Policy 

1937-49, vol. V, Document 333.

2 David Ross, formerly Consul in Dili, had been released from 

captivity by the Japanese in June to convey a message demanding 

the surrender of Australian forces still fighting in Portuguese 

Timor. The troops had refused to surrender and Ross had 

subsequently been evacuated to Australia. See also ibid., 

Documents 528 and 533.

3 That if Bowden and Ross were released the U.K. Govt would permit 

one or two Japanese officials en route to Japanese missions in 

Europe to travel on the evacuation ships. See ibid., Document 516.
