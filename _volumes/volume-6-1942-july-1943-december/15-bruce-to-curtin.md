# 15 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 122[A] LONDON, 2 August 1942, 11 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY

Following is note referred to in my immediately preceding telegram 

121[A] [1]:- 

'In the course of a short conversation with the Prime Minister 

this evening, after dealing with matters upon which I was seeing 

him, some reference was made to the question of our representation 

in the War Cabinet. As the Prime Minister stated with some 

emphasis that, "His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and 

Northern Ireland" must have the right to sit alone, and referred 

to the impending arrival of an Indian representative and Nash's 

presence, it is fairly clear how his mind is working. He 

visualizes the presence at meetings of War Cabinet of permanent 

representatives of India and Australia, plus representatives of 

other Dominions from time to time and possibly all together. This 

is an impossible picture and illustrates the point on which I 

differed from Page [2] when the question of our representation in 

War Cabinet was in the melting pot. Page was endeavouring to 

create a system under which a representative of each Dominion 

would sit in the United Kingdom War Cabinet. This to my mind was a 

quite unworkable proposition. I felt, however, that an immediate 

crisis with Australia consequent upon demand for a voice in the 

higher direction of the war following on Japan's initial successes 

might be overcome if an offer was made to the Dominions of a 

representative in War Cabinet but only Australia accepted. Knowing 

the attitude of Mackenzie King and Smuts this seemed a reasonably 

safe bet. Fraser was the only doubtful quantity, not because he 

wanted a representative in the War Cabinet, but because he might 

feel impelled to insist on one if an Australian representative was 

appointed. 

In the result all went well as no Dominion other than Australia 

asked for a representative in War Cabinet. On this basis it seemed 

to me possible that the arrangement might work. 

An examination of what Australia was asking, and what the Prime 

Minister here promised, makes it clear that there were great 

difficulties to be overcome if what was visualized in the exchange 

of telegrams between the Prime Ministers here and in Australia was 

to be realized in practice. [3] When Evatt arrived at the 

beginning of May, it was clear that the arrangement had not 

achieved what was hoped from it. This view Evatt held strongly and 

he told me that in conversation he had with the Prime Minister at 

Chequers on the Friday before he left, he had explained to the 

Prime Minister the whole position and enlisted his co-operation in 

putting it right. [4] 

On this understanding I agreed to become Australia's accredited 

representative and set out my understanding of my task in my cable 

to the Prime Minister No. S.34 of 4th June (copy attached 

herewith). [5] 

(Note:-From copy of this telegram (S.34) I withheld the sentence 

with regard to the position of United Kingdom members of War 

Cabinet.) 

Since I undertook the responsibilities of Australia's accredited 

representative I have been trying quietly to improve the position 

and was not without hope of eventual success. The visit of the 

American representatives last week to discuss the broad strategy 

of the war placed me in a considerable difficulty. I heard of this 

visit when the Prime Minister announced it to the Cabinet on 

Monday 20th July. As by Thursday I had not been summoned to any 

meeting of War Cabinet either with regard to instructions to be 

given to the Chiefs of Staff or to consider the results of their 

discussions with Marshall and King, I felt that I should advise 

the Government of the position and drafted the cable of 23rd July 

[6] (copy attached herewith). This telegram I decided to think 

over during the night and as I was summoned to a War Cabinet 

meeting on Friday I decided to postpone sending it until after the 

meeting. As a result of discussion at the meeting I decided not to 

send the telegram. For it I substituted my telegram 111[A] of 25th 

July (copy of which is attached herewith) [7] together with other telegrams I have sent on the subject of Hopkins, Marshall and 

King's Visit. [8] 

Although the immediate problem created by the visit of American 

representatives has passed the major question of implementation of 

the arrangement with regard to our representation in War Cabinet 

remains unsettled. The only hope of satisfactorily dealing with 

this problem is by personal discussion between the Prime Minister 

and myself 

I am convinced that the Prime Minister is anxious to find an 

effective means of honouring the obligation which he has 

undertaken. The only solution which I can see is for the 

Australian representative to take part in formulation of all major 

questions of policy. If this, or some other arrangement that will 

be reasonably satisfactory both to the United Kingdom Government 

and Australian Government, cannot be acceded to, there appears to 

be no alternative but to declare frankly that the contemplated 

basis of Australian representation in the War Cabinet is 

unworkable. The latter course would have most unfortunate results 

and every effort of good sense and good will must be made to avoid 

it.' 

Note:-The draft telegram not sent which I refer to above I am 

forwarding in my immediately following telegram 123[A]. [9]
