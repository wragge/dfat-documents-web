# 3 Commonwealth Government to Attlee

Cablegram 360 CANBERRA, 8 July 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your telegrams 497 [1] and 498. [2]

1\. In view of fact that we received cablegrams from Bowden up to 

February 10th, and advice that he stated on the day before the 

actual capitulation took place he proposed to remain, we are not 

satisfied with the Japanese statement that he left Singapore for 

the N.E.I. about the end of January. [3]

However, as there is a doubt about his present whereabouts, and as 

Ross is outside Japanese control [4], we are prepared to proceed 

with exchange scheme as a whole, on lines and on basis of 

priorities originally suggested. [5] As, however, scheme 

contemplates further ships at a later stage we would insist that 

the Japanese be specially requested to agree to the repatriation 

of Bowden and his staff as soon as their whereabouts become known.

2\. As Free French have agreed to surrender Japanese from New 

Caledonia for whom priority has been requested, we have 

reconsidered this question. As military position in relation to 

New Caledonia has substantially altered recently with the arrival 

there of American forces and in regard to which internees probably 

cannot be so well informed, we now withdraw our previous 

objection.

2 Dispatched 6 July (FA:A3195, 1942, 1.26571). It expressed 

concern at the Commonwealth Govt's proposal to exclude from the 

exchange plan Japanese from New Caledonia held on behalf of the 

Free French.

5 Between 27 August and 9 September two Japanese ships arrived at 

Lourenco Marques carrying some 1800 U.K. and Dominion nationals 

from Japan, Manchuria, Japanese-occupied China, Indo-China and 

Thailand, while three British ships arrived with an approximately 

similar number of Japanese who had been interned in the British 

Empire. Among the Australians repatriated were the staff of the 

former Legation in Tokyo and their families.
