# 157 Churchill to Curtin Circular cablegram D219 [1]

LONDON, 15 April 1943, 2.50 p.m.

SECRET AND PERSONAL

Received 16 April 1943

The time has now come when we must devote serious thought to the planning of the future world organisation both in the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities and also for the long term settlement. The lessons of 1918 when we were caught unprepared by the end of the war show how necessary proper planning is. This time let us make sure that we are ready both with our Armistice terms when the enemy sues for peace and with our long term plans.

In this planning it is essential that the British Commonwealth and Empire should take its full share. Each of us has his own contribution to make but only by working together in full co- operation and agreement can we ensure that our proper influence and collective strength are exerted.

Already as you know some progress has been made with the detailed working out of plans for dealing with specific post-war problems, more especially on the economic side. But all these plans presuppose some general political organisation and we have recently found our planning hampered by the absence of any clear formulation of our combined policy in the post-war world.

I suggest therefore that at this stage it would be most valuable if the five Prime Ministers could meet together to discuss these problems and agree upon the part which the British Commonwealth and Empire can and should take in organising world affairs. Apart from the intrinsic value of such private discussions on the major issues which we shall soon have to face I attach great importance to demonstrating to the world our solidarity and strength.

I hope that you will find it possible to attend such a meeting here. I can well understand that it is not easy for you to leave your country for any prolonged absence but I very much hope that by careful timing we may be able to arrange a date convenient to all and not involving prolonged delay for any.

Please let me have your views as soon as possible. I should myself like a meeting, in June or July but if it is impracticable then I hope that August or early September could be arranged.
