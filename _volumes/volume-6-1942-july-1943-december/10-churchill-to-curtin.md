# 10 Churchill to Curtin

Cablegram 532 [1] LONDON, 24 July 1942, 10.12 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Your JOHCU No. 37. [2]

I send you a minute which has been prepared by the Chiefs of 

Staff.

Begins.

It had always been our intention to build up a considerable force 

in the Levant-Caspian area this summer in order to provide against 

the possibility of a break on the Russian southern flank and a 

German advance through the Levant or Persia.

2\. The extension of the war to the Far East compelled us-

(a) To divert to Malaya and India three British Divisions (the 

18th, 5th and 2nd) from the United Kingdom which would otherwise 

have been available for the Middle East.

(b) To return from the Middle East to Australia two out of the 

three Australian Divisions.

(c) To send the 70th British Division from the Middle East to 

India.

(d) To despatch to Burma and Malaya certain British-Indian 

formations which were to have gone to Basra.

(e) To retain in India certain other British-Indian formations 

which were similarly destined.

3\. As a result the Levant-Caspian front is now almost bare and we 

entirely depend for the security of these vital regions on the 

Russian front holding. We estimate that even if the Russians were 

to break, the Germans could not invade Iraq and Persia in great 

strength until the spring of 1943; but if there were little or 

nothing there to stop them they could push through with small 

forces at a much earlier date.

4\. Much depends also upon the result of the battle now raging in 

Egypt. If we win it may be possible to divert some of the forces 

now fighting in the Western Desert to secure the northern front; 

but these will be only a fraction of what is required.

5\. We ourselves are doing everything we can to reinforce the 

Middle East. The 44th Division is just about to arrive; the 51st 

Division arrives next month; and the 56th Division is being 

prepared for despatch in August. This will probably be followed by 

a further armoured division from this country. In addition we are 

prepared to move one or even two divisions from India which is now 

less threatened.

6\. Even however if General Auchinleck wins his battle and all the 

above reinforcements reach their destination there will not be a 

man too many in the Middle East as a whole. It is our considered 

opinion that to withdraw the 9th Australian Division at the 

present time or indeed during this year (1942) would endanger the 

safety of the vital Abadan oilfields. Without them we cannot hope 

to maintain our position in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean. 

Some 60 per cent of Australia's oil requirements are supplied from 

this source and owing to heavy loss of tankers could not be 

brought from elsewhere without the greatest difficulty if at all.

7\. Apart from the necessity on strategical grounds for retaining 

the well-seasoned 9th Australian Division in the Middle East it 

must be remembered that its transportation to Australia, coupled 

with the transportation of a division to replace it, would involve 

an unjustifiable and dangerous shipping commitment. Minute ends.

Part 2

1\. I note the points you make about wastage and the difficulties 

you may find in despatching reinforcements from Australia. I very 

much hope that you will be able to overcome these difficulties and 

keep your fine Division now gaining fresh distinction up to 

strength. But should this prove impossible, I suggest that it 

would be necessary to fall back upon the expedient of making good 

wastage by breaking up ancillary units.
