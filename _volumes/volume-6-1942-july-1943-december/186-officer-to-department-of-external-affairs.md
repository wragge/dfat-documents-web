Cablegram 83 KUYBYSHEV, 11 May 1943, 5.15 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

British Embassy has advised me of the proposal that Australia should assume the protection of Polish subjects and interests in the U.S.S.R. during the suspension of their diplomatic relations.

(2) You may have already come to a decision and no doubt would do so on grounds of policy. You will not have overlooked the fact that such protection would be liable to cause constant friction with the Soviet Authorities. The Legation would of course do their utmost to avoid friction and prevent it, if it did occur, impairing our general relations.

(3) Amount of extra work entailed would depend on whether the Soviet Authorities permitted the Poles to communicate freely with the Legation. If they did not (which is most likely) we would require [1] Third Secretary and a clerical officer who could read, speak and type Polish. If they did, work would be very greatly increased and include general protection, welfare and passports and we would require (a) experienced Diplomatic Secretary, (b) two assistants with the rank of Third Secretary, able to speak and read Polish, (c) three male clerical officers able to read and type Polish. (c) could not be found locally but might be found in Egypt or Palestine.
