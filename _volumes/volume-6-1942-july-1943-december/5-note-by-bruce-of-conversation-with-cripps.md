# 5 Note by Bruce of Conversation with Cripps

## [LONDON], 13 July 1942

I had nearly an hour with Cripps this morning. I told him that I 

had come to see him because of the state of complete frustration 

into which I was getting. Cripps interjected at once that I was 

not the only person suffering from such a feeling.

I then explained to him what was causing my present attitude. I 

said it was caused by two things-the first was that as a member of 

the War Cabinet I did not appear to be getting any information or 

being consulted about anything and that I was not at all sure that 

my position was not the position of the other members of the War 

Cabinet-the second was that when one initiated anything nothing 

appeared to happen. I instanced on the second point the Note I 

sent to the Prime Minister with regard to the Air against the Sea. 

[1] I then outlined to Cripps what had happened, including the 

report by Slessor and Brind and Portal's rejection of it.

I found that Cripps had been in touch with Slessor and had some 

knowledge of what had been happening and he added to my knowledge 

the interesting information that Pound and Portal nearly came to 

blows when the report was up before the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

I stressed to Cripps that this aspect showed an impossible 

position. Nothing was more urgent than to get this question put on 

a proper basis and yet all that had been achieved in a month was 

to find ourselves at the point from which we had started plus an 

intensification of the feeling between the Air Ministry and the 

Navy.

I suggested that this was intolerable and unless we could alter 

that state of things we should end up by losing the war. Cripps 

agreed and said that his mind had been turning in the direction of 

an advisory body to the Minister of Defence, which would consist 

of individual members of the three Services who would be 

completely divorced from their particular Services. I said that I 

quite agreed with that idea provided that in addition to being 

advised by this body the Prime Minister would consult regularly 

with his War Cabinet. I also suggested that to this body might 

well be added a fourth member dealing with questions of scientific 

research and new weapons.

I then told Cripps the approach that had been made to me on this 

question, outlining to him the discussions with Butler and the 

move on to John Anderson. [2]

Cripps agreed that these two questions were of major importance. 

He tended to the view, which I think is probably right, that they 

have to be dealt with separately, and then gave many examples of 

the people who had communicated with him on the scientific side 

complaining that the organisation was not working satisfactorily 

and in many cases that their own individual services were not 

being utilised.

I then urged on Cripps that it was no use our merely sitting there 

and discussing the position and coming to the conclusion that 

things were not as they should be, we had got to do something to 

remedy it.

Cripps agreed with this but stressed the difficulty of handling 

the Prime Minister who had such very definite preconceived 

notions. In any case Cripps urged that it was necessary to know 

exactly what you wanted altered, how you wanted it altered and 

that the members of the War Cabinet should be agreed upon the 

point. He said that it was no use the War Cabinet approaching the 

Prime Minister if everyone had got different ideas; that the Prime 

Minister would then play one off against the other and demonstrate 

that the situation as it was, was as satisfactory as it could be.

I then reverted to the suggestion of the three military advisers 

to be divorced from their respective Services, and said that that 

at least would be a start and that if the Prime Minister could be 

persuaded to accept that and reasonable consultation with the War 

Cabinet could be ensured, the position might gradually be righted.

With this Cripps agreed, but he then showed that his own mind was 

becoming worried about the position. He said quite frankly that 

there were a considerable number of people in the country who 

looked to him to ensure that things were all right and he clearly 

was doubtful whether he was quite honouring his obligations to 

them. It also came out in the conversation that Cripps has not had 

any personal contact with the Prime Minister for some time. From 

this I would rather gather that his visit to Chequers when he was 

going to raise the question of Duncan and Sinclair, about which he 

spoke to me when I last saw him [3], had not materialised. I 

judged from the general tone of the conversation, which was very 

different from that when we met before, when Cripps indicated that 

he was in very close touch with the Prime Minister, that recently 

he had been held more at arms length.

The conversation, which had started on the note that unless I 

could get my position more satisfactorily dealt with I was 

doubtful if I could go on, rather turned at the end in the 

direction of Cripps feeling very much the same way in regard to 

himself.

I judged that Cripps is considerably worried by the position and 

is somewhat perplexed as to what line he should take. I think the 

one thing which weighs with him very much is that he does not 

feel, in taking a definite line, he would get any real support 

from the other members of the War Cabinet.

After we had drifted for a little time into the above atmosphere 

we came back to the question of what we should attempt to do, and 

Cripps then sent for a Memorandum which he said he had not 

prepared himself but with which he was in very considerable 

agreement. [4] When the Memorandum arrived he gave it to me and 

suggested I should glance through it. As it was a fairly long one, 

and obviously dealt with the position in some detail, I said that 

I was afraid that was not much use to me as I took a little time 

to absorb anything. Cripps then suggested that I should take the 

Memorandum with me and read it quietly. This I agreed to do and 

the conversation then ended.

With regard to the Memorandum, it was a fairly long document and 

broadly the proposal it made was down the lines of the three 

military advisers divorced from their respective Services, but it 

proposed that the Secretary of State for Air, and the Secretary of 

State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty should be 

abolished, and all their powers be concentrated in a new Minister 

for War, who really would be the successor to the Minister for 

Defence.

With regard to the three particular Services it was contemplated 

that a Minister should preside over the Navy Board, the Army Board 

and the Air Council, but that they should all three be under the 

direct control of the Minister for War.

It also contemplated the abolition of the Chiefs of Staff 

organisation and the Cabinet Secretariat, the two being merged 

into the War Ministry.

This proposal is working in the right direction but to attempt to 

bring it all about at one blow seems to me to ignore practical 

difficulties. I accordingly sent the Memorandum back to Cripps 

with the letter attached hereto. [5]

1 Bruce's note of 16 June to Churchill (on file AA: M100, June 

1942) dealt with a matter currently in dispute between the 

Admiralty and the Air Ministry, viz. the best use to be made of 

long-range aircraft (see J. R. M. Butler, Grand Strategy, vol. 

III, part II, HMSO, London, 1964, PP. 533-40). Bruce argued that 

resources should be devoted not only to bombing Germany, but to 

providing 'effective air action against the sea' and urged 'the 

immediate appointment of a small high powered Committee' presided 

over by 'a Cabinet Minister not associated with either the Navy or 

Air Force' to examine 'how our aerial offensive power against the 

sea can be strengthened both on a long-term basis and 

immediately'. A portion of the note is quoted in the Second 

Enclosure to Document 52. At a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on 

24 June, Portal strongly opposed Bruce's suggestion but it was 

agreed that he and Pound should each nominate an officer to review 

the general policy for employment of the air forces on the basis 

of the priorities laid down by Churchill and Roosevelt at 

Washington in December 1941. Accordingly, Rear-Admiral E. J. P. 

Brind and Air Vice Marshal J. C. Slessor produced a report on 2 

July (not found on Commonwealth Govt files) which supported the 

Navy's case.

2 Sir Henry Tizard had approached Bruce to enlist his support for 

a plan to co-ordinate matters relating to new weapons and 

scientific investigation. R. A. Butler and Sir John Anderson had 

also been consulted on the matter. See Bruce's note of a 

conversation with Tizard on 8 July (on file AA:M100, July 1942).

3 See Bruce's note of a conversation with Cripps on 2 July (on the 

file cited in note 2). Cripps appears to have intended suggesting 

to Churchill that Sir Andrew Duncan and Sir Archibald Sinclair be 

removed from the War Cabinet.

4 Not found on Commonwealth Govt files.

5 Dated 13 July. On the file cited in note 2.
