# 60 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 168[A] LONDON, 15 October 1942, 12.17 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY

My telegram 165[A]. [1] In dealing with the prisoners of war question at War Cabinet meeting (my telegram 167[A]) [2], the Prime Minister twice expressed his regret that I had not been at the War Cabinet meeting where the matter was dealt with.

He said that the question was urgent and had had to be dealt with at a meeting of the United Kingdom members summoned to deal with domestic questions.

This was hardly in accord with facts but in view of the handsomeness of the Prime Minister's apology-and nobody can do this better when he wants to-I thought it more tactful not to draw attention to this. You can, I think, now regard this episode as closed.

BRUCE
