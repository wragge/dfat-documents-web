# 137 Hodgson to Eggleston

Cablegram PC4 CANBERRA, 16 March 1943

PERSONAL SECRET

Your S.40. [1]

I fully appreciate your position and have endeavoured to expedite.

Minister however has been very pressed over political crisis here [2] and arrangements impending visit abroad.

Difficulty here over articles (a) and (g) of proposed exchange of notes.

In one telegram you suggested omission [3] but I now note you desire acceptance without conditions. However telegram is being sent to you today following on our acceptance of issue British Order in Council, to which we previously demurred owing to our separate negotiations. [4]

Minister is in consequence suggesting to you simple exchange of notes which is best possible solution for the various difficulties that have arisen. It seems you can now advance good reasons for this and for abandonment of negotiations for separate treaty.
