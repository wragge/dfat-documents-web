# 281 Evatt to Stirling

## Cablegram 224 CANBERRA, 18 September 1943

Please deliver following personal message from Minister to Eden alone.

Begins.

I would refer you to D.650 and D.651 [1] and our reply No. 244 of 16th September. [2] You are well aware of my views on the topic of the Dominions, and I feel that unless the present practice is closely watched a great deal of serious misunderstanding will be created. Step by step the Dominions are being excluded and I foresee trouble unless a halt is called to present tendency.

In some respects the position is not as satisfactory as it was when Lloyd George was Prime Minister. This is a personal message for you but I have already expressed similar views at British Cabinet.

I would like you to discuss question particularly with Amery and Kingsley Wood who will I am confident prefer to regard the proper unit and party the British Commonwealth rather than United Kingdom only.

Best wishes. Ends.

EVATT
