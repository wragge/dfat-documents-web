# 178 Evatt to Churchill

Cablegram unnumbered [1] WASHINGTON, 6 May 1943

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR MR CHURCHILL ALONE MOST SECRET

I thank you most sincerely for your message of welcome. [2] I am concerned as to my movements. In order to see as much as possible of your good self I had proposed to leave for England about 21st instant in order to return to Australia after staying in London about three weeks. Recent developments of which you know [3] suggest necessity of modification to fit in with your plans.

I cannot sufficiently express my pleasure and eagerness at prospects of renewal of friendship which greatly helped to save my country from disaster. May I add this, it seems to me at this difficult time that it would also greatly help Empire interests if we were taken into more intimate collaboration, equally important is open demonstration of such collaboration and solidarity. At the proper time I would appreciate your help and suggestions.

EVATT
