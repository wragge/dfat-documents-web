# 275 Attlee to Curtin

Circular cablegram D633 LONDON, 8 September 1943, 11.05 a.m.

SECRET AND PERSONAL

The Prime Minister has asked me to recall to you his message in telegram D. No. 219 of 15th April. [1] Now that the Australian and South African elections are over and that the New Zealand election has been fixed for September, Mr. Churchill greatly hopes that it will now be found possible definitely to arrange a meeting of the five Prime Ministers in London in November. There are strong reasons for holding such a meeting as explained in that telegram and recent events have indeed emphasized the desirability of early consultation between the Prime Ministers, especially on post war problems. It is not of course a formal Imperial Conference of the pre-war type that is in mind, but a meeting of the five Prime Ministers, the number of official advisers being kept to the minimum.

The importance of adequate preparation was stressed in replies to the Prime Minister's earlier message. We are fully alive to the importance of this and if the date proposed is generally acceptable we would send as soon as possible, for your consideration, suggestions as to the agenda for the meetings and as to the best method of arranging for the necessary preparatory work. As time is short for this, Prime Minister would be grateful for the earliest possible reply.
