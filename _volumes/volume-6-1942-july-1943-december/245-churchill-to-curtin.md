# 245 Churchill to Curtin

Cablegram 177 [1] LONDON, 17 July 1943, 3.50 p.m.

SECRET THE MINISTER

Reports have been received here which suggest that various matters in connection with past conduct of the war are being raised in controversy in the present election campaign in Australia. I am concerned at the possibility that these controversies may lead to disclosures of secret information and of expressions of views contained in messages which we have, from time to time, sent to the Australian Government.

Moreover, it seems to me there is a real risk that our views and policy may become a controversial issue in Australian politics which, I am sure, you will agree would be unfortunate and undesirable and might compel me to make some explanations.

I would ask you, therefore, to consider what can be done to prevent embarrassing and possibly dangerous disclosures, and, in particular, to urge that those who, by reason of their position, are in possession of secret information should not employ it in public political controversy.
