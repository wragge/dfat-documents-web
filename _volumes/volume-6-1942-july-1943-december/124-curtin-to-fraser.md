# 124 Curtin to Fraser

## Cablegram 47 CANBERRA, 23 February 1943

Your telegrams No. 48 [1] and 49 [2] received. The Commonwealth Government would be glad to receive Mr. Berendsen as High Commissioner for New Zealand in Australia [3] and arrangements would be made for Government Departments to co-operate with him in every possible way.

Having regard to our previous oral discussions we have not recently considered the question of appointing a High Commissioner in New Zealand. We will now do so. For the immediate present we would be content with our present representative in New Zealand.

[4] This decision need not however delay your plans in regard to Mr. Berendsen. We would give him a warm welcome and would bear in mind the question of making a reciprocal appointment as early as practicable.
