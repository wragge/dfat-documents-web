# 159 Watt to Hood

Cablegram 220 CANBERRA, 1 April 1946

SECRET

Reference our immediately preceding telegram 219, Mandates. [1] Have discussed your telegrams 206 [2] and 208 [3] with Minister.

It would appear desirable to take some care, as regards Dominions Office Meetings in general, to avoid creation of any impression that complete agreement can always be reached between Commonwealth representatives who will then inevitably present a common front at subsequent international conferences.

Frank interchange of views from time to time may be valuable, but frequent meetings which might have effect of persistent pressure to secure complete agreement could become embarrassing.
