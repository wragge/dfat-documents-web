# 77 Department of External Affairs to High Commissioner's Office in London

Cablegram 735 CANBERRA, 8 February 1946

SECRET

Please endeavour to obtain the support of the United Kingdom Government to the election of Australia to the Central Committee at the forthcoming Council Meeting of U.N.R.R.A. [1] We propose to bring forward similar resolution to last August [2] to increase Central Committee from 6 to 9 by adding Australia, Brazil and one European country yet to be determined. It would also be helpful to know of any United Kingdom proposals concerning the future of U.N.R.R.A. [3]
