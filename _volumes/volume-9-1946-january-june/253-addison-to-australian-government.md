# 253 Addison to Australian Government

Cablegram D509 LONDON, 18 May 1946, 12.18 p.m.

TOP SECRET

My immediately preceding telegram. [1] The following is the text of the United States Draft Treaty on disarmament and demilitarisation of Japan. Begins.

PREAMBLE:

The Governments of the United Kingdom, China, the Union of Soviet Socialist republics, and the United States have declared their intention to effect the total disarmament and demilitarisation of Japan. This intention was expressed in the Potsdam declaration of July 26th, 1945. In substantial measure it has already been fulfilled. Nothing shall prevent the completion of the process. It remains to ensure that the total disarmament and demilitarisation of Japan will be enforced as long as the peace and security of the world may require. Only this assurance will permit the nations of Asia and the world to return single-mindedly to the habits of peace. To achieve this ojective, the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Republic of China, the Union of Soviet Socialist republics, and the United States agree to engage in the common undertaking defined in this treaty.

Article 1:

The High Contracting Parties agree that they shall take steps jointly to ensure that:

(a) all Japanese armed forces including Land, Air, anti-Aircraft and Naval Forces, all para-Military forces such as the Gendarmerie (Kempei Tai) and the Garde (Keipei Tei) and the special police (Tokka Ka) and A organisations auxiliary to the foregoing shall be and shall remain completely disarmed, demobilized and disbanded.

(b) Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the Staffs of the Army and the Navy and the Staffs of any para-military organisations shall be and shall remain disbanded.

(c) No Japanese Military or para-Military organisations in any form or guise shall be permitted in Japan.

(d) The manufacture, production or importation of military equipment in Japan shall be prevented, in particular the High Contracting Parties shall prevent the manufacture, production or importation of- (1) All arms, ammunition, explosives, Military equipment, military stores and supplies, and other implements of war of all kinds. (2) All Naval vessels of all classes both surface and submarine and Auxiliary Naval-craft.

(3) All Aircraft of all kinds, Aviation equipment, and devices and equipment for anti-Aircraft defence.

(e) The establishment, utilization or operation for Military purposes of any of the following shall be prevented.

(1) All Military structures, installations, and establishments including, but not limited to Military Air fields, Seaplane Bases, and Naval Bases, Military and Naval storage Depots, permanent and temporary Land and Coast fortifications, Fortresses and other fortified areas. (2) All factories, Plants, shops, research Institutions, Laboratories, testing stations, technical data, Patents, Plans, Drawings and inventions designed or intended to produce or to facilitate the production of items listed in the paragraph (d) above.

(f) Under conditions which may be established by the High Contracting Parties the demilitarization and disarmament required by this article shall be subject to the following exceptions and to no others: (1) The formation and employment of such detachments of Japanese Civil Police and their equipment with such types and quantities of imported small arms as may be essential to the maintenance of public security and (2) the importation of minimum quantities of those items listed in paragraph (d) (1) above such as explosives or ingredients of explosives which may be essential for purposes of construction mining agriculture or for other peaceful purposes.

Article 2:

To implement the disarmament and demilitarization provisions set forth in Article 1, the High Contracting Parties agree that they shall make provision for a system of quadripartite inspection which shall become operative upon the termination of all occupation of Japan. This system of inspection shall be conducted through a Commission of Control to be established by the High Contracting Parties on a quadripartite basis. The commission of control, through its officers and Agents shall conduct in any and all parts of Japanese territory, such inspection, inquiries and investigations as it may deem necessary to determine whether the disarmament and demilitarization provisions set forth in Article 1 are being observed.

Article 3: High Contracting Parties agree that for the duration of the period of Allied occupation of Japan they shall support the strict enforcement of the disarmament and demilitarization provisions set forth in Article 1. They agree further, that the express acceptance by Japan of the provisions of Article 1, and 2, shall be an essential condition to the termination of Allied occupation of Japanese Territory.

Article 4:

The Commission of Control provided for in article 2, shall submit a report to the High Contracting Parties whenever, in the opinion of a majority of the members of the Commission, it has reason to believe that a violation of the disarmament and demilitarisation provisions of Article i has occurred or is about to occur. In conjunction with such report, the Commission shall submit a recommendation for action on the part of the High Contracting Parties which appears appropriate to a majority of the members of the Commission. Upon receipt of such report and recommendation the High Contracting Parties will by common agreement take such prompt action, including action by Air, Sea or land Forces as may be necessary to assure the immediate cessation or prevention of such violation or attempted violation. The High Contracting Parties agree that within six months of the effective date of this treaty they shall consult for the purpose of negotiating special quadripartite agreements which shall provide in the greatest practicable detail for inspection, inquiry, and investigation by the Commission of control, for the numbers and types of forces which each party shall make available for purposes of this treaty for their degree of readiness, and general location, and for the nature of the facilities and assistance which each shall provide.

Such special quadripartite agreements shall be subject to ratification by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes.

Article 5 :

This Treaty shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes. The ratification shall be deposited with the Government of... which shall notify all the High Contracting Parties, of each deposit.

This Treaty shall come into force upon the deposit of ratifications by each of the High Contracting Parties. This Treaty shall remain in force for a period of twenty-five years from its effective date. The High Contracting Parties agree to consult six months before the date of expiration of this treaty for the purpose of determining whether the interests of international peace and Security require its renewal with or without modification-or whether the Japanese people have so far progressed in the reconstruction of their life on a democratic and peaceful basis that the continued imposition of the controls defined therein is no longer necessary.
