# 44 Department of External Affairs to Makin

## Cablegram UND8 CANBERRA, 23 January 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Reference Soviet and Ukrainian requests concerning Greece and Indonesia [1] it is consistent with our attitude in case of Iran [2] that they should be heard and as chairman you should accordingly agree to place these matters on Council agenda.

As with Iran we are concerned at this stage solely with procedure and protecting right under the Charter of any member to bring any question in proper form to attention of Council or Assembly. No question as to substance or merits of the requests is involved in merely observing procedure whereby they may be given fair hearing.
