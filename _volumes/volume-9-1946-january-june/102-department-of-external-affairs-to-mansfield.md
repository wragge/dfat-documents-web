# 102 Department of External Affairs to Mansfield

Cablegram 59 CANBERRA, 21 February 1946

[1] We think suggestion is quaint and quite unjustified as Hirohito is part of the Japanese Government and this puts him on the wrong side of the record and further supports the myth that he, or any member of the Japanese Government, cannot be charged with war crimes. The terms of surrender meant only acquiescence by Japan that in accordance with the will of the conqueror war criminals would be subject to stern punishment. [2]
