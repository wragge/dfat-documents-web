# 215 Evatt to Forde

Cablegram E13 LONDON, 26 April 1946, 5.38 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your A.19. [1] Course you propose seems correct one but feel facts must be ascertained. An investigation should take place at an early date and I suggest that Judge Kirby be sent immediately to Batavia for this purpose. If he so recommends, demand should be made for compensation as well as punishment. Kirby has had considerable experience of area.
