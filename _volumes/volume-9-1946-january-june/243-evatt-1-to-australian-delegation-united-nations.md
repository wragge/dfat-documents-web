# 243 Evatt [1] to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram New York 20 LONDON, 13 May 1946, 4.54 p.m.

SECRET

Reference your UN109. [2]

The form and manner of your protest were not in accord with the Minister's instructions. It was quite proper to protest at the sulky and improper treatment of the Security Council by Gromyko.

It was quite wrong to suggest that this affected voting or validated Security Council powers. What should have been done was to use materials of Iran as already approved by the Minister and which would have been suitable to the occasion. Instead there was only inadequate personal attack on Gromyko. [3]

1 This cablegram is headed as being from Evatt himself although its text refers to him in the third person.

2 Document 237.

3 On 22 May the Security Council decided 'to adjourn the discussion of the Iranian question until a date in the near future, the Council to be called together at the request of any of its members'. The delegate of the Soviet Union was absent.
