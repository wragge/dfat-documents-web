# 152 Department of External Affairs to Hodgson

Cablegram 496 CANBERRA, 29 March 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

UNY.9.

1\. Your telegrams Security 8 [1] and 11 [2] received. Situation which has developed is extremely unfortunate and is precisely the kind of situation which cabled and verbal instruction to you were designed to avoid. It was the purpose of these instructions to ensure that everything posible was done, after matter had been placed on agenda, to see that Iranian situation was dealt with by Council in proper and orderly manner and that reasonable time for preparing case was granted to parties under appropriate conditions (See paragraph 15 of our UNY3 [3]). We also considered it essential, as part of process of full investigation of facts, that persons making statements in relation to dispute should be closely questioned, and all relevant matters elucidated (See paragraphs 3 and 4 of our UNY7 [4]). You do not appear to have questioned Persian Ambassador along lines suggested.

2\. You should still do everything possible to obtain support for appointment of a Committee of Enquiry in accordance with our UNY 3, and if satisfied of reasonable support put forward formal motion. Members of Council and Persia should be asked to provide this Committee with all relevant documents and information and Committee could report to Council on its work on April 10th. Such a Committee should not include representatives of Soviet Union or Persia, nor of United Kingdom or United States, who are really parties to same dispute. A suitable Committee of three would be France, China and Australia; if a Committee of five is required, Mexico and Poland could be added.

Appointment of such a Committee would make clear Council's desire to ascertain real facts and reach impartial and just decision.
