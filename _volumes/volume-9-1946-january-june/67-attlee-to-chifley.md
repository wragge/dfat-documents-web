# 67 Attlee to Chifley

Cablegram 42 LONDON, 4 February 1946, 6.08 p.m.

SECRET AND PERSONAL

I think the time has come when it would be great advantage to arrange, if possible, a meeting of British Commonwealth Prime Ministers. The particular subject which I have in mind as one on which we should take Counsel together is that of the situation in the Pacific. But no doubt, if a meeting can be arranged, there are other questions which you or I would find it helpful to discuss together.

As regards timing, I know very well the difficulty which you are bound to find in leaving your headquarters for any prolonged absence, it has, however, occurred to me that in any event you may think it desirable yourself to represent Australia at the meeting in Paris of the Peace Conference which is to be held to settle finally the terms of peace with Italy and the Eastern European Axis Satellites. This Conference, in accordance with the Moscow Agreement, is due to be arranged for the beginning of May, but I think it probable that it will in fact not be held until later in that month. I would suggest that we should try to arrange a meeting in London say a week or ten days before the time fixed for the opening of the Paris Conference.

I very much hope that you will be able to come. I need hardly say how great a personal pleasure it would be to me to welcome you to London for your first visit as the Prime Minister of Australia. I am communicating in a similar sense with the other Prime Ministers.
