Evatt nominated Eggleston as Australian representative 'for the time being', with Lavarack to assist him. At the F.E.C.'s first meeting on 26 February, Eggleston expressed Australian regret that the terms of reference had been drawn up without consultation with other powers concerned, and that voting procedure was 'not consistent with Australia's position as a party principal in the Pacific War'. New Zealand also formally opposed the veto arrangement.
