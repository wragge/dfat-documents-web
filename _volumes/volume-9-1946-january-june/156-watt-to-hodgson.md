CANBERRA, 1 April 1946

Cablegram 502

IMMEDIATE SECRET

UNY.13.

Have discussed your Security 16 with Minister, especially paragraph 8.[^1] It seems most desirable that Australian representative should participate in any investigation undertaken by Council. We would prefer investigation by a Committee of Enquiry appointed for purpose. As previously indicated[^2], we do not think that Soviet Union, United States or United Kingdom representatives should be appointed to any such Committee as all of them are really parties to dispute. There should be reasonable possibility, therefore, of Australia being appointed to Committee and if you can obtain sufficient private assurances to this end you should move for appointment of Committee. On the other hand, if Australia is likely to be excluded from any such Committee, or if appointment of Australian representative is very doubtful or uncertain, it may be best to leave investigation in hands of Council as a whole. Nothing should be said, however, to prejudice position for future regarding general desirability of appointment of Committees of Enquiry in appropriate circumstances.

2. Full reports of Security Council Meetings contained in your various telegrams are appreciated.

[AA : A1838 TI89, 854/10/2, i]

[^1]: Paragraph 8 reported the view of the U.S. Secretary of State, James Byrnes, that any investigation into the U.S.S.R .- Iran dispute be conducted by the full Security Council and not a smaller Committee of Enquiry.
