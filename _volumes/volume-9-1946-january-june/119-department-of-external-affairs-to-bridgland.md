# 119 Department of External Affairs to Bridgland

## Cablegram 166 CANBERRA, 7 March 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Please convey the following personally to the Secretary-General from Dr. Evatt.

'. . . I share your anxiety that the best possible material should be available from which to build United Nations staffing and organisation. To assist you in this I have asked our representatives in London to nominate Mr. W. E. Dunk, Secretary, Department of External Affairs to the position of Assistant Secretary General for the Department of Administration and as a second nomination Lt. Gen. Sir John Lavarack for the position described as Department of Personnel and the Budget.

Both these individuals have had long and distinguished service with the Commonwealth Government and although their services can ill be spared, I am making the nominations to assist you in your very onerous responsibility.

Details of the careers and experience of the two nominees will be amplified by our representative. . .'
