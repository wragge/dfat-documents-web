Cablegram 307 CANBERRA, 25 February 1946

SECRET

Your 192. [1]

Some care should be exercised before India and Philippines are added to Tribunal which is already very numerous.

1 Dispatched 21 February. It recommended Australian support for India's request to be represented on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

2 Indian claims were supported by the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and both India and the Philippines were represented on the tribunal.
