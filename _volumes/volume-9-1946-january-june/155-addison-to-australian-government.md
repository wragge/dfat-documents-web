# 155 Addison to Australian Government

Cablegram 126 LONDON, 28 March 1946, 6.30 p.m.

SECRET

Reports which we have received from Tokyo and Washington indicate that it is very desirable that the Far Eastern Commission should at an early date examine the proposals in regard to the economic policy to be adopted for Japan with a view to action being taken to meet problems of the kind which we have been considering in consultation with you and other Governments of the Commonwealth.
