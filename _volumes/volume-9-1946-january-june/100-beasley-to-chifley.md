# 100 Beasley to Chifley

Cablegram 30 LONDON, 20 February 1946

TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL

I understand that you are to be approached through the United Kingdom High Commissioner's office with a suggestion that we should provide in Australia facilities for trials of guided missiles. We discussed this with W. H.COULSON,in November last when he was in Australia. [1] I am informed that this is almost certain to be one of the biggest defence research fields of the future. Our co-operation in this matter would be an important contribution to British Commonwealth defence and I think that it will be very much in our interests to take part in this work. I would like to recommend acceptance of proposal to send Mission to Australia to discuss the matter.
