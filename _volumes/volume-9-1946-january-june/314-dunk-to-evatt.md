# 314 Dunk to Evatt

Cablegram 917 CANBERRA, 18 June 1946

IMMEDIATE SECRET

In course of informal conversation concerning South Seas Commission Minter has shown interest in the scheme and it seems possible he might if approached be prepared to make favourable recommendations to the State Department regarding United States participation. Glad to know urgently whether you would favour such an approach in light of your knowledge of probable State Department attitude. Realise also that even if you have not yet had an opportunity you may consider it preferable to raise the matter yourself with the United States authorities.
