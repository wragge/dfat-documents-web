# 76 Evatt to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram UND30 CANBERRA, 8 February 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 879. [1]

Every effort is to be made to have San Francisco selected now or later. At same time you should not run the risk of any temporary location of the site being fixed outside the U.S.A. New York is certainly second to San Francisco and I rather deprecate the suggestion that there could be any improper influence on the proceedings by citizens of New York who have been for the most part extremely sympathetic to international cooperation. It is most important that your arguments should not be turned into support of provisional arrangement keeping site in any place in Europe.
