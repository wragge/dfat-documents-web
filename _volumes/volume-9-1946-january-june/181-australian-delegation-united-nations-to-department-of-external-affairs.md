# 181 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram United Nations 48 NEW YORK, 9 April 1946, 9.15 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Security 32.

1\. The Polish representative transmitted a letter to the Secretary General to-day to the effect that the existence and activities of the Franco regime in Spain had created a situation of the nature referred to in article 34 [1] of the charter and stated that he would shortly request that this matter be placed on the Agenda of the Security Council. The text of the Polish letter will be sent En Clair.

2\. The Polish Ambassador, informed our Mission privately, that the nature of the recommendations he would ask the Council to make would depend on the support he received. He hoped for a recommendation that members of the United Nations break off Diplomatic relations with Spain, but doubted whether he would seek for any form of economic action. He was seeking agreed action by the Security Council and had no interest in making extreme proposals only to be voted down.

3\. Your UNY 26 [2] has been received. It is now considered unlikely that Spanish question will be considered by Council before the 12th, and it may be deferred until the 15th.
