# 193 Evatt [1] to Beasley

Cablegram 086 SINGAPORE, 16 April 1946, 11.40 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

In Singapore yesterday the Prime Minister and I discussed with Lord Louis Mountbatten the situation in the Netherlands East Indies. I consider it most important that Dutch-Indonesian agreement [2] should not be finalised without some definite understanding as to the use by British forces of such bases as Sourabaya, Koepang, etc.

2\. I also discussed the situation disclosed in the meeting of the food conference [3] under Lord Killearn. I am impressed by the seriousness of the food situation in South East Asia caused by drastic reduction by the Combined Food Board in allocations to this area and think you should assure yourself that this reduction is not unduly drastic compared to cuts in, for example, the allocation to U.N.R.R.A.

1 Evatt and Chifley were en route to London.

2 See Document 177.

3 Held in Singapore between 15 and 17 April to consider the urgent need to increase food production in South-East Asia.
