Cablegram Johcu 26 [1] CANBERRA, n.d.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

Your telegram No. 12. [2]

We have the same view of Casey [3] as yourself. Our whole purpose is that in view of Evatt's [4] almost due arrival Washington we greatly hope Casey will be there as that conjunction invaluable.

That is full extent our demurrer. Casey has never intimated to me any desire for change but we would not stand in way your desire.

We should hope however Casey stays long enough to meet Evatt and thus accomplish our desires. [5]
