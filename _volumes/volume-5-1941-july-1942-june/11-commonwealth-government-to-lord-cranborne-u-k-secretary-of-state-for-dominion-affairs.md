# 11 Commonwealth Government to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

## Cablegram 461 [1] CANBERRA, 21 July 1941

Your telegram 445 Lease-Lend. [2]

We are pressing on with organisation for dealing with acquisition 

of goods under Lease-Lend. Following is present position in 

relation to requirements listed in your paragraph 3. (a) Generally 

speaking through import licensing civil imports from United States 

of America have been limited to essentials. No relaxation of 

standards of what is essential will be permitted but rather the 

procedure of progressively intensifying restrictions will be 

continued.

(b) (1) Instructions have been issued to all Commonwealth 

Government Departments to place all orders for goods from United 

States of America with Australian Section of British Purchasing 

Commission, New York. This applies also to orders which previously 

have been placed through the United Kingdom Ministry of Supply.

(2) List of Service requirements for 1941/42 will shortly be 

cabled to New York. These will be followed by necessary detailed 

specifications etc. as soon as possible.

(3) Lease-Lend Clearing House for non-warlike goods is being set 

up on the basis of the existing import licensing organisation. All 

private orders for goods listed which are approved by Clearing 

House will be placed with Australian Section British Purchasing 

Commission as Government orders for procurement under Lease-Lend 

if possible.

(4) Clearing House organisation will not be operating effectively 

for few weeks.

(5) Clearing House will (in collaboration, where necessary, with 

appropriate Department) attempt to obtain consolidated orders for 

goods listed in your paragraph 5 and also for other machinery, 

railway, docks and harbour equipment, telephonic and 

communications equipment, and civil aircraft as advised by 

Australian Minister in Washington. [3]

(c) No further Government orders for goods in classes referred to 

will be placed privately in United States of America. Non-

Government orders will be centralised once the Clearing House is 

operating.

(d) In distributing goods outside Government departments we cannot 

see any satisfactory alternative to charging on the basis of 

estimated cost including incidental cash charges which may be 

incurred in respect of Lease-Lend goods. Proceeds of sales would 

be used-

(i) in case of sales to Government contractors to be set against 

gross cost to Department concerned;

(ii) in other cases to be used for war expenditure.

We are satisfied that only by this means can adequate control and 

economy be secured. Should it be necessary for private interests 

to act as agents for government in distributing goods they will 

not be permitted to make profits. Any remuneration will be on 

basis of commission or direct payment for services.

We will advise as early as possible on further developments.
