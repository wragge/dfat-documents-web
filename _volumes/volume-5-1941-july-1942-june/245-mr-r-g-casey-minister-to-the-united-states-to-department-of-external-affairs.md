# 245 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 1249 WASHINGTON, 1 January 1942, 1.05 a.m

IMMEDIATE SECRET

My telegram 1240. [1]

'Letter of instructions' has been continuously discussed and somewhat amended but I believe not in any really important sense from what I have sent you. It will be considered by President [2] and Churchill tomorrow after which presumably it will be telegraphed to you in full.

The question of 'appropriate body' which is to give instructions to supreme commander is still undecided. Difficulties are-(a) that at such a body would have to make decisions not only in respect of South-West Pacific but wherever the war is being conducted against the Axis, and (b) that members of such a body would have to refer any matter of consequence back to their Governments. Opinion at moment is tending towards a joint staff body in London and a similar body in Washington, which would receive supreme commander's recommendations and after quick consideration consult with Governments concerned.
