# 297 Mr V. G. Bowden, Official Representative in Singapore, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 69 (extract) SINGAPORE, 23 January 1942, 8.54 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

(7) General Officer Commanding Malaya [1] is forming a special staff under General Officer Commanding Fortress (Keith Simmons) to make final preparations for defence of Singapore Island.

(8) Keith Simmons reveals to me that all fixed defences Singapore Island are directed seawards. None are directed towards mainland.

His defence armament nevertheless appears strong but his garrison has been weakened by withdrawals to reinforce troops on mainland.

BOWDEN
