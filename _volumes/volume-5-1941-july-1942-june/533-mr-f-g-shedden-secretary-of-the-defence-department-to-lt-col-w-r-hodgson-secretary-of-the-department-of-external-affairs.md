For External Affairs from Ross. [1]

Since occupation Dilli have been close prisoner in house which has been looted by Japanese soldiers.

For three months have been half starved owing lack of food for sale Dilli and refusal Japanese allow servants search for food in surrounding country. Japanese suggest I might convey to Australian Company guarantee of proper treatment (...) [2] prisoners in event of surrender. I agreed to convey this suggestion. I did not give any indication that I would return Dilli, but merely said that I would write and give the reply of the Australian Company. I do not intend returning for imprisonment in Dilli and am writing to Japanese to give reply that Australians will not surrender.

Do you want me to return to Australia if possible, or shall I become a fugitive and remain in this territory in hope that Japanese might evacuate Dilli. Cipher books have been destroyed.
