# 12 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 543 WASHINGTON, 21 July 1941, 7.50 p.m.

I saw Sumner Welles [1] today.

They have information that 11 Japanese troopships left Chinese 

ports today and that a convoy of Japanese troopships (strength 

unspecified) has also left Formosa for unknown destination.

Sumner Welles said that their information was that the Japanese 

would attack Indo-China bases on July 24th. [2] French may or may 

not put up token of resistance.

As soon as the fact of Japanese occupation of additional areas in 

Indo-China can be definitely established (which Sumner Welles 

thought would not take longer than two days after such occupation) 

United States would take the following economic action:-

(a) Freezing of all Japanese funds in United States.

(b) Stoppage of practically all imports from Japan including silk.

(c) Limitation of export of all petroleum products from United 

States to Japan to the level of some past year such as 1934.

(d) Further reduction in octane rating petrol exportable to Japan. 

[3]

Sumner Welles said he had no clear idea what economic action 

Britain and Australia propose to take but he hoped that the lack 

of economic action by us would not offset the abovementioned 

United States action.

I asked Sumner Welles if he did not think some further warning to 

Japan was worth while. He said that except for precise knowledge 

of details Japanese already knew some such strong industrial 

action as the above would follow on any further aggression.

On my inquiring what response he anticipated that Japan would make 

to the above American action he said that he expected renewed 

public outburst regarding British-American policy of 

'encirclement' and strong protests but nothing more.

time'.

on 22 July. See cablegram 550 on file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i.
