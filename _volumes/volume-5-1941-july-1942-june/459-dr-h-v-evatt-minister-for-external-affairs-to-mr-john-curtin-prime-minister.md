# 459 Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister

Cablegram S32 WASHINGTON, 7 April 1942, 7.52 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

For Curtin.

Your P.M. 17 [1] and No. 417 [2] Russia. I have discussed this fully with Halifax. [3] The Government of the United Kingdom is adhering to its views that it is urgently necessary to meet Russia's request to recognise 1940 boundaries. Halifax says that their conclusions are the same as those you and I expressed to London on several occasions. [4] Bruce [5] concurring.

Movement of war is the main factor although there is much to be said for the view that no conflict with the Atlantic Charter is involved. The President [6] is more non-committal than opposed to Churchill's views so it is unnecessary to pursue the matter further here.
