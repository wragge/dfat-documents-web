# 270 Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 67 CANBERRA, 14 January 1942,

IMMEDIATE PERSONAL FOR CASEY FROM EVATT

Reference your 64. [1] I should like to ask you two questions for my immediate guidance:

(1) Did you and do you really suppose that we suggested a joint A- B-D-A body for South-western Pacific operations was to be located in Australia? (2) Whether Churchill shared and so far as you know still shares this belief as much as your cable suggests.

So far as I know such a suggestion has never been made in the very numerous communications that have passed between any of the Governments concerned, yet at this late stage you and he discuss the proposition upon a basis which so far as I know was non- existent.

To me it rather savours of the old game called Aunt Sally. Do you think Churchill was playing it?
