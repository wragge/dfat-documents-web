# 511 Mr J. B. Brigden, Financial Counsellor at the Legation in Washington, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 810 WASHINGTON, 1 June 1942, 6.31 a.m.

IMMEDIATE

Reciprocal Lend Lease.

(1) I was summoned to the State Department and handed a document which will be telegraphed to you in my immediately following telegram. [1] In form it is a draft exchange of notes between the Australian Minister, Washington, and the Secretary of State indicating Australian willingness to provide reciprocal aid in the widest terms; and agreeing to the inclusion of other United Nations who participate.

(2) It assumes that Australia has already signed a duplicate of the United States-United Kingdom Mutual Aid Agreement of February 23rd [2], and appears to be a standard form for all United Nations. A copy different only in name was handed to the United Kingdom representatives at about the same time. A similar copy is to be given to Mr. Nash. [3]

(3) We are given to understand that the document has been approved by the President [4] and Cordell Hull. [5] It must inevitably supersede discussions with Acheson [6], and will require consultation with United Kingdom which may not agree to the major policy involved. I saw Phillips [7] and will send comments on the foregoing when responding to your 671 [8] just received.
