# 99 Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr M. de A. Ferreira de Carvalho, Governor of Portuguese Timor

## Letter CANBERRA, 5 November 1941

I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has decided that, with a view to securing more effective co-operation between itself and your Administration, it is desirable that a fully accredited British Consul should be established in Portuguese Timor. His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is now taking steps through His Majesty's Ambassador at Lisbon [1] to obtain provisional recognition of Mr. David Ross as Consul, prior to the completion of formalities for full recognition and issue of an Exequatur. In the meantime His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has appointed Mr. Ross as its Official Representative in Portuguese Timor. Mr. Ross holds a document under my hand and seal defining his functions. [2]

I avail myself of this opportunity to express the hope that the appointment of Mr. Ross will serve to extend the close relations and friendship which have always existed between Timor and Australia and to secure and promote a more effective co-operation between the two countries.

In thanking you for your past courtesies to Mr. Ross, I express my confidence that you will extend to him every facility and privilege that will enable him to exercise his functions to the benefit of our respective countries. [3]

H. V. E[VATT]

3 The Governor informed Ross on 10 December that he had received instructions from Lisbon to recognise him as 'Consul for Great Britain and Representative for the Commonwealth'. See Ross's letter of 11 December on file AA : A981, War 72. On 23 December the Commonwealth Govt suggested to the U.K. Govt (cablegram 829 on file AA : A1608, J14/1/9, i) that although Ross would be in title U.K. Consul in Dili he should continue to receive his salary and instructions from the Commonwealth Govt. This was accepted by the U.K. Govt on 19 January 1942 (see cablegram 77 on file AA : A981, Australia 248).
