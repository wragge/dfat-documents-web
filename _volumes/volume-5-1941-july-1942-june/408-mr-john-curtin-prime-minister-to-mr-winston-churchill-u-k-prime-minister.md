I desire to inform you that Dr. H. V.

He is travelling by air across the Pacific Ocean and will visit United States of America first.[1]

On arrival in the United Kingdom it is desired that he be accepted as the accredited representative of the Australian Government in the War Cabinet and admitted to its deliberations on the same basis as Sir Earle Page.
