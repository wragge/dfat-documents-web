# 356 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs

## Cablegram 332 WASHINGTON, 21 February 1942, 4 a.m.

Following personal for Minister External Affairs from justice Frankfurter. [1]

[Begins] I have seen, of course most privately and confidentially, your message to Casey [2] and President's reply. [3] I can assure you of most anxious and sympathetic understanding here of the circumstances and the needs immediately touching the Commonwealth.

I know that point of view of the President is taken in full light of the whole situation and I believe in the interests of Australia in the long run and which may not be a very long run. Regards.

[Ends]

CASEY
