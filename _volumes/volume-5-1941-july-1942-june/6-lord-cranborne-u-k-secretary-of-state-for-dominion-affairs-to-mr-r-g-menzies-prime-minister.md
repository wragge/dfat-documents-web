# 6 Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Circular cablegram M149 LONDON, 12 July 1941, 11.17 p.m.

IMPORTANT MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister. My circular M.1[3]6 of 5th July 

[1], my circular M. 140 of 9th July. [2]

JAPAN

In conversation with H.M. Ambassador [3] on 8th July, the United 

States Under Secretary of State [4] indicated that he agreed as to 

the probability of a Japanese move to secure bases in Indo-China 

foreshadowed in my circular M.136.

2\. On 10th July, Mr. Welles showed Lord Halifax a message from the 

United States Ambassador at Tokyo [5] reporting that Matsuoka [6] 

had disclaimed to him intention of attacking Russia, anyhow in the 

near future. The United States Government had, however, received 

information from Chungking source to the effect that on 6th July, 

in return for German and Italian recognition of Japanese sphere of 

interests in East Asia, Japan had undertaken to move south 

immediately to commandeer bases in Indo-China and Thailand. There 

would be later an attack on Siberia with special mention of 

Vladivostock. This agreement had been approved by the Japanese 

Imperial Council on 8th July.

The United States Government had further report from the Chinese 

Ambassador at Berlin [7] that the Japanese move against Siberia 

would be practically simultaneous with the southward move.

3\. The United States Government had also information:

(a) that the Japanese Missions in Mexico and Central America had 

been authorised to finance subversive activities there;

(b) that the Japanese Missions in North and South America had been 

ordered to be prepared to destroy confidential files at a moment's 

notice.

4\. Mr. Welles said that the United States Government would 

announce shortly that the Panama Canal was closed for repairs. 

Japanese ships therefore which had been ordered to make homeward 

journeys between 14th July and 22nd July would be unable to do so. 

Any British ships with material for Great Britain would of course 

be allowed passage though this would not be announced.

5\. Mr. Welles confirmed the definition of United States policy as 

follows:

Until Japanese commit an overt act, the United States would make 

no further communication of minatory kind. As soon as they did so, 

the United States would impose embargo on all principal materials 

wanted by the Japanese such as metals, cotton, lubricants (but 

not) [8] necessarily on foodstuffs.

6\. The United States would regard as overt acts any acquisition of 

bases in Indo-China even if done in agreement with the Indo-

Chinese authorities since this would clearly in effect be under 

German duress. The United States would judge acquisition of bases 

in Thailand according to circumstances.

7\. The United States would apply the same economic action in the 

event of any overt action against Russia but not if the Japanese 

merely denounced the Russian pact. [9]

8\. In reply to an enquiry as to what the United States would do if 

the Japanese gave warning of their intention to interrupt supplies 

en route to Vladivostock, Mr. Welles said that the Japanese 

Government would hardly impose a blockade against Vladivostock 

without declaring war on Russia in which case the first step of 

economic pressure would be applied. The next step would then be 

considered.
