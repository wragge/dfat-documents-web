# 13 Department of Trade and Customs to Mr L. R. Macgregor, Government Trade Commissioner in North America

## Cablegram 2196 CANBERRA, 23 July 1941

Clapp's [1] telegram 2597 of 19th July.

We cannot understand United States request that Commonwealth 

Government should retain title to all material procured through 

Lease Lend. Goods to be obtained for non-government use may be 

classified into:

(a) durable equipment for industry,

(b) materials raw or partially manufactured for further 

manufacture in Australia,

(c) commodities ready for final consumption.

It would be possible, though inconvenient, for the Government to 

retain the title to goods falling in the first class. In this case 

the equipment would have to be hired to the users. A charge of 

some sort would clearly be essential if user was not to be given 

unfair advantage over competitors. Moreover in case of supply of 

parts, e.g., locomotive equipment, cost of incorporation may 

exceed cost of equipment and in any case Railway Department would 

probably refuse to accept such goods on basis of title remaining 

with Commonwealth. Although system of hiring equipment would be 

possible it would be administratively difficult and we would much 

prefer to have the right to sell the equipment outright to the 

user devoting the proceeds to war purposes as outlined in my cable 

to Dominions Office of which you have Copy. [2]

Materials for further manufacture in Australia would be for:

(a) contractors producing for Government and

(b) manufacturers producing for sale to public.

It would be possible to retain the title to materials issued to 

contractors. These materials could be issued without charge, 

contract prices being made up excluding the cost of materials so 

issued. We are certain, however, that this method is wasteful and 

likely to lead to fraud. In our view proper control and economy 

can be obtained only by charging contractors for materials issued 

and debiting the cost against the final amount due to them. If 

finished goods were subsequently forwarded to Middle East, India 

or Singapore fronts it might be impossible or impracticable for 

Commonwealth to retain title, e.g., cotton drill made into 

uniforms.

It appears to us to be impracticable to retain the title to 

materials being manufactured for consumption by the public. If 

they were issued free of charge to manufacturers it would lead to 

differential prices for similar commodities to consumers which 

would be impossible to police. In case of durable goods title 

could perhaps be retained on basis of annual rental charge. We 

would strongly prefer to avoid this as Lease Lend Clearing House 

would probably develop into Hire Purchase Collecting Office.

The foregoing difficulties apply equally to goods for final 

consumption. Generally speaking we feel that both these classes 

must be sold to commercial users at approximately commercial 

prices if the administrative problem is to be kept within bounds.

We took previous requests that distribution should not be on a 

profit basis to mean that where agents were employed to distribute 

goods to commercial users such agents were to be remunerated on a 

payment for services basis. We understood that United Kingdom 

proposed to seek U.S. approval for the sale of goods (other than 

those for direct use by the Government) acquired under Lease Lend 

by the Government to the commercial users whether for manufacture 

or for sale to the public on the ordinary commercial basis. (See 

D.O. cables 334 [3] para. 7C and 445 [4] para. 3D.) We have made 

our plans accordingly. This view is confirmed in cable received 

yesterday from Bruce [5] which he despatched after consultation 

with United Kingdom Treasury officials.

We are anxious to meet United States requirements in every way 

possible but suggest that you consult with United Kingdom 

representatives on this question. In view of United Kingdom 

obtaining foodstuffs and other consumption goods under Lease Lend 

we cannot see how they can administer their distribution on the 

basis of the Government retaining title to all materials obtained 

under Lease Lend.

Please advise us of United Kingdom views and urge upon them 

strongly the necessity for seeking U.S.A. approval for 

distribution on a more practicable basis.

Your telegram raises questions:

(a) whether there are any other British Supply Council 

instructions of which we should know,

(b) whether it is agreed that these instructions should apply to 

the Dominions,

(c) whether the instructions are drawn up primarily to meet 

conditions obtaining in the United Kingdom.

Would appreciate earliest possible replies to this and my telegram 

of 22nd as plans for Clearing House are vitally affected. [6]
