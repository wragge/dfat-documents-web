# 14 Commonwealth Government to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 467 [1] CANBERRA, 23 July 1941

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Your M.172. [2]

Commonwealth Government is fully in accord with conclusions set 

out in paragraph 4 of your telegram under reference. [3] As you 

are aware, we have always attached highest importance to gaining 

assurance of collaboration of United States in course of action in 

restraint of Japan. Now that the United States Government has 

decided to adopt severe measures in event of Japanese move in 

Indo-China, we feel strongly that whole object of our policy in 

Far East over past year would be negatived if British Empire now 

lagged behind United States in effectiveness or determination of 

its own counter measures, and same consideration would apply to 

any attempt at this stage to dissuade United States from 

proceeding to contemplated lengths. We emphasise, however, need in 

our opinion for utmost frankness in present exchanges with United 

States Government in sense of paragraph 4 (3) in order that there 

can be no possibility of misunderstanding. [4]

Ministers to the United States and Japan as nos 75 and 4.

2 Dispatched 22 July. On file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i.

3 This paragraph stressed the U.K. Govt's belief that it was 

important to co-operate in measures which the United States 

proposed to take against Japan if it occupied Indo-Chinese bases.

4 Paragraph 4(3) read: 'That if we are called upon to go to 

lengths which involve plain risk of war with Japan, every effort 

should be made to obtain the clearest possible indication from 

United States that we can count without reservation on their 

active armed Support.'
