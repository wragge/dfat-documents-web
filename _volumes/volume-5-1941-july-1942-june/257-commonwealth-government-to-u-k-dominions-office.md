1 AA:A3195, 1942, 1.426.

2 This sentence was apparently mutilated in transmission. The relevant sentence of War Cabinet minute 1667 of 5 January (in AA:A2673, vol.10) read: 'That the Government agree to the transfer of the 6th and 7th Divisions from the Middle East to the Netherlands East Indies, together with Corps troops and maintenance and base organisations.'
