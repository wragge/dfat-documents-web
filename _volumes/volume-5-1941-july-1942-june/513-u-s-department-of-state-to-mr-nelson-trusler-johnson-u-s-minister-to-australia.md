# 513 U.S. Department of State to Mr Nelson Trusler Johnson, U.S. Minister to Australia

Cablegram [189] [1] [WASHINGTON], 1 June 1942

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL FOR THE MINISTER

Will you please deliver personally at the earliest moment the following message to Prime Minister Curtin from the President:

QUOTE Because we face so many mutual problems across the Pacific, I think it would be most helpful if we might have a talk on the war situation some time after Evatt [2] has returned to Australia and you have had a chance to discuss his visit. Would it be possible for you in the next few months to visit Washington, in which case I should be very glad to put at your disposal such transportation facilities as might render your voyage possible? I should genuinely welcome an opportunity for such a discussion. Any time will suit me if you will give me about a week's notice. [3]

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

_ AUSTRALIA]

1 Inserted from Johnson's letter to Cordell Hull (U.S. Secretary of State) of 21 July (in Franklin D. Roosevelt Library: P.S.F.

safe file, box no. 2. Australia). Johnson reported that Curtin had advised him that he would be glad to accept Roosevelt's invitation ' "should circumstances of Government permit" ', but in Johnson's view, the political and administrative problems facing Curtin were too formidable to permit him to leave Australia in the near future.

2 Minister for External Affairs.

3 At a meeting of the Pacific War Council in Washington on 25 June, Roosevelt mentioned that he had also invited the N.Z. and South African Prime Ministers (Peter Fraser and Field Marshal J.

C. Smuts) to come to Washington. See Sir Owen Dixon's cablegram S61 of 26 June on file AA:A981, War 41B.
