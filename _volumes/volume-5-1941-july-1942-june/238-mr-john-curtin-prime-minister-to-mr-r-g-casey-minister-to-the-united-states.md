1\. This is the first occasion on which the possibility of such a declaration has been mentioned to this Government.

2\. Dealing with the actual proposals:

(a) The declaration as drafted is assented to by us.

(b) Adherence of Russia is vital. For that reason, if necessary, the preamble should be made acceptable to that country.

(c) We feel that the order of signature should be alphabetical throughout.

(d) As India's status is not yet that of a self governing nation the inclusion of name might be questioned.
