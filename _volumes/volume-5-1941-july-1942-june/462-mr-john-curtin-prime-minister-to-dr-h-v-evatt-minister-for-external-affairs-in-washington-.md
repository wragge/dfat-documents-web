# 462 Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister, to Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs (in Washington)

Cablegram PM37 [1] CANBERRA, 9 April 1942

MOST SECRET IMMEDIATE

Your S.30 of 6th April. [2] Proposal for new European front has been discussed by War Cabinet and Advisiory War Council who feel that they are not in a position to express an opinion on what is essentially a strategical question and should be decided as such.

[3]

They are, however, most strongly of the view that such an adventure should not be undertaken in response to clamour from any group of public opinion or the press or for political reasons.

This question is, therefore, one in the first place for the views of the experts responsible for the grand strategy of the war and it is noted that Field Marshal Dill [4] and Admiral King [5] do not favour it.
