# 505 Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister, to Mr Winston Churchill, U.K. Prime Minister

Cablegram Johcu 33 CANBERRA, 29 May 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

I have received from Dr. Evatt [1] a lengthy report on the results of his mission to London.

_ express our warmest thanks for your assurances of support, for the instructions issued to the representatives of the Chiefs of Staff to support the requisitions of MacArthur [2] and the representations of the Australian Government, and for the practical assistance you are giving in the matter of equipment. In particular, we are most grateful for the provision of a wing of three Spitfire squadrons, which Dr. Evatt has told me was your own conception. They will be a great contribution to the security of our country and will, we hope, have a demoralizing effect on the Japanese Air Force.

3\. The inclusion of an R.A.F. squadron is a magnificent gesture on your part, and I am confident that this practical manifestation of support will do much to encourage the Australian people in their inflexible determination to fight till victory is won.

4\. I shall take an opportunity when Parliament reassembles next week to express in general terms the Government's appreciation of the help you have given to its representative in London. [3]
