# 267 Commonwealth Government to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 42 CANBERRA, 11 January 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

My telegram No.37 [1] and your 34. [2] Portuguese Timor. We still think it of the utmost importance that General Wavell's [3] opinion should be sought, as he and not our Chiefs of Staff is responsible for the area which includes Portuguese Timor. We would urge that steps be taken at once to obtain his advice.

We would mention that General Wavell has sent an enquiry [4] to our Chiefs of Staff on this subject and they have forwarded a brief reply [5] indicating that it is proposed to withdraw Allied forces from Portuguese Timor upon arrival of 700 Portuguese troops and suggesting that full information be obtained by him from London.
