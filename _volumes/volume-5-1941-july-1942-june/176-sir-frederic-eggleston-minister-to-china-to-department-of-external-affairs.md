# 176 Sir Frederic Eggleston, Minister to China, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 24 CHUNGKING, 9 December 1941, 9 a.m.

SECRET

The Foreign Minister [1] asked me to see him this afternoon and when I called he handed me the following statement:

(1) Despite sincere efforts made by United States in her recent conversations with Japan to settle by peaceful means the various questions bearing on Pacific, Japan has suddenly launched an attack on United States and Great Britain.

(Portion of telegram omitted in transmission. Cable Co. asked for missing groups.) [2]

(3) The Chinese Government has decided to declare war against Japan and also her partners, Germany and Italy.

(4) In order to make possible full concerted action, the Chinese Government deems it imperative that every member of the anti- aggression bloc should consider as a common enemy every member of the Axis group. We therefore suggest that a simultaneous declaration of war by United States against Germany and Italy, and by Soviet Russia against Japan, should be made.

(5) For effective and successful prosecution of the war, the Chinese Government consider necessary the conclusion of a military alliance between Soviet Russia, United States, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Netherlands and China with a unified command of Allied forces under American leadership.

(6) Chinese Government propose that an agreement be concluded between United States, Soviet Russia, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Netherlands and China not to sign any separate peace.

I pointed out the omission of South Africa and suggested that the words might be Great Britain and the other members of British Commonwealth of Nations. He, however, said South Africa was not a Pacific power and he decided to issue it saying that it had been approved by Chiang Kai-shek. [3]
