# 412 Mr Winston Churchill, U.K. Prime Minister, to Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister

Cablegram Winch 12 [1] LONDON, 13 March 1942, 11.55 p.m.

CLEAR THE LINE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

Your Johcu 25. [2] Both principal Ministers I have consulted and Chiefs of Staff are agreed in wanting Casey for this Most important post which requires military experience and knowledge of public affairs both ministerial and diplomatic. [3] I had a whole evening in the train with Casey when I was in America, and learned from him that he was very anxious for a change. Indeed he suggested that he might go as a liaison officer to the ABDA area when this was being shaped. I have no doubt he would greatly welcome this appointment which also strikes the note of bringing Statesmen from all over the Empire to the highest direction of affairs. I will venture to court your rebuke by asking whether Menzies [4], with his great distinction and success when passing through America, might not fill the gap caused by Casey leaving Washington. However this may be, and I trust you will not resent my intrusion upon your affairs, I should be very grateful if you would reconsider your demurrer.

I will cable you to-morrow on the President's [5] proposals for the two areas. [6]

CHURCHILL
