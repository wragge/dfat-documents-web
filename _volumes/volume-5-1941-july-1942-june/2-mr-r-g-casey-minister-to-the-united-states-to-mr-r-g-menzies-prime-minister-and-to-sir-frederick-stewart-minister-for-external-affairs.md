# 2 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, and to Sir Frederick Stewart, Minister for External Affairs

Cablegram 507 [1] WASHINGTON, 9 July 1941, 1.10 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister and Minister for External 

Affairs.

My telegram No. 502. [2] I saw Sumner Welles [3] today. He 

believes that the secret information available and the known 

concentration of Japanese naval forces make it evident that the 

Japanese have decided on a southward expedition probably in the 

next fortnight. He believes the Japanese are pressing Germany to 

press Vichy to agree to the Japanese occupation of air and naval 

bases in Southern Indo-China. Sumner Welles says that Germany has 

not yet agreed so to press Vichy probably because of the effect 

that this would have on Weygand [4] in North Africa and on the 

French public opinion in France. Japan naturally wants to get 

Indo-China by agreement with Vichy and without fighting if 

possible but Sumner Welles believes that Japan will take Indo-

China by force if necessary.

Sumner Welles believes that Japan would be content for the present 

with Indo-China and some infiltration into Thailand, e.g., go no 

further for the present.

If Japan gets Indo-China by agreement with Vichy and without 

fighting, Sumner Welles was not prepared to say what the United 

States would do. However, if Japan used force he told me that the 

United States would place immediate and complete economic and 

financial embargo on Japan.

Sumner Welles believes that they and/or we should avoid, as long 

as possible, becoming involved in war in the Far East as well as 

in Europe, although he clearly has little faith in our being able 

to do so for long. He believes that their economic and financial 

embargo would provoke Japan to war with them before long.

Sumner Welles is convinced of the uselessness of [their] warning 

Japan further. He said that they have made such representations to 

Tokyo that it is certain that Tokyo knows 'that United States 

means business'.

Sumner Welles admits the possibility that the German hold-up in 

Russia and American occupation of Iceland may deter Japan but he 

is not hopeful.
