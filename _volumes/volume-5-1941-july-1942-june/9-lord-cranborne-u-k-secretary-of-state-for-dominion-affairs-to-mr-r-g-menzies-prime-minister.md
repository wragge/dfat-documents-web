Circular cablegram M161 (extract) LONDON, 17 July 1941, 10.50 p.m.

IMPORTANT MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister: My Cite. M. 151. [1]

All of His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions have now 

concurred in our proposal to proceed at the appropriate moment 

with denunciation of the Commercial Treaty. [2]We are accordingly 

informing the United States Government that we propose to take 

this step immediately there is any overt act on the part of Japan.

2\. The Commonwealth Government have stressed to us the importance 

of following up the above action with intensified economic 

restrictions. We fully agree with this view and hope to telegraph 

detailed proposals as soon as we have received further indications 

of the United States Government's intentions; see my Circ. M.158. 

[3]

3\. In the meantime certain further possible measures have also 

occurred to us. They are:

1\. closing of the Japanese Consulate General at Singapore;

2\. placing of Ishihara and Okura on the statutory list. [4]
