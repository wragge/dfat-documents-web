# 5 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr Tatsuo Kawai, Japanese Minister to Australia

## Letter MELBOURNE, 11 July 1941

The Government has given very careful consideration to your letter 

of 27th June [1] regarding the desire of your Government to secure 

supplies of copra from the Territory of New Guinea, and has made 

enquiries regarding the position.

You are doubtless aware that Japan is normally an exporter of oils 

and fats. Our advices are that recently Japan has been importing 

very large quantities of copra, coconut oil, castor seed oil, 

etc., and has been exporting fish oil, whale oil, coconut oil, 

soya oil, and soya beans to Germany. Japan has also, we are 

advised, acted as a channel for the supply to Germany of foreign 

lard and tallow.

Australia has contributed to Japan's imports of oil by permitting 

the export of certain quantities of copra to Japan, despite the 

fact that, normally, Australia supplies to Japan negligible 

quantities of this commodity. In these circumstances it does not 

at present appear practicable for the Australian Government to 

issue any further licences for the export of copra to Japan.

Recently the Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs [2] 

informed the Australian Minister at Tokyo [3] that the shortage of 

food oil in Japan was due to the failure of the soya bean crop in 

Manchoukuo, whereas your understanding appears to be that it is 

due to a reduced production of fish oil. I feel bound to say that 

on the facts before it, it seems to the Australian Government that 

any shortage in food oil in Japan is due to substantial exports to 

Germany with whom we are engaged in war.

On this question of Japan's food supplies, I earnestly hope that 

your Government does not overlook the ready co-operation that has 

been forthcoming from Australia. Since the outbreak of the war, 

Australia has supplied to Japan very large quantities of wheat, 

flour, and barley, and has granted credit for long periods on 

liberal terms. The most recent evidence of our desire to assist 

Japan is the decision to permit the export to Japan of Corriedale 

Sheep to the total of 20,000 during the present year. Your request 

in this instance was gladly granted because you emphasised that 

the sheep were required for distribution to small farmers, whose 

general economy depends partly on the possession of a few sheep.
