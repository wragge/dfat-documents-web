# 1 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Field Marshal J. C. Smuts, South African Prime Minister, and to Mr W L. Mackenzie King, Canadian Prime Minister

Cablegram 46/2 [1] CANBERRA, 3 July [1941]

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

I have been much exercised about the relations of the Dominions to 

the important matter of central control of war policy.

We all have the greatest admiration for the genius, personality 

and work of Churchill, but I was greatly struck in London by the 

following facts: -

1.Churchill carries far too great an individual burden, and this 

has obvious dangers in a long war;

2.The constitution of the War Cabinet is such that members of it 

have much departmental work, involving heavy pre-occupation with 

detail. For example, Beaverbrook has the far-reaching portfolio of 

Supply, Bevin the complex problems of the Labour Department, and 

Kingsley Wood the Exchequer. This inevitably means that such 

Ministers have little time for the perusal of major reports, 

access to the heads of the Fighting Services, and those studies 

and reflections which are necessary to see the war and the world 

as a whole.

3.Under the existing system, I frankly think that there is 

inadequate consideration of long range policy in relation to the 

winning of the war, an insufficiently comprehensive view of how 

the productive capacity of the Empire and the United States can be 

marshalled for the best results, and an unsatisfactory direction 

of foreign policy, which can at a time like this no longer be left 

to one Minister, but should represent the joint wisdom and 

decision of an authoritative Cabinet.

4.Apart from an occasional visit by a Dominions Prime Minister 

there has been an absence of effective consultation with the 

Dominions to elicit their point of view in regard to major 

questions of policy. This is in no sense intentional but results 

naturally from the fact that the Dominions Secretary [2] is not a 

member of the War Cabinet or the Defence Committee and is 

therefore little more than a channel of communication.

5.Churchill being absorbed for long hours every day in the 

supremely important tasks of strategy and the leading and 

stimulating of the public mind, financial and economic questions 

which are of vast importance not only now but in the post war 

period tend to slip into the background and to have somewhat 

spasmodic attention.

I am strongly of the opinion that there should be a War Cabinet in 

the real sense, meeting daily, thinking out and discussing large 

matters, and in which Churchill would have constructively critical 

colleagues who, being free of minor activities, would be able to 

give him the support and advice which even the greatest man must 

have if he is to reach his highest effectiveness.

In such a Cabinet I believe that a Dominions Prime Minister 

should, if one is available, have a place. In the absence of such 

an arrangement, we will find ourselves conferring by cable, with 

all the attendant delays and ambiguities about matters which 

require constant consideration and prompt decision.

You will, I am sure, share my feeling that these matters are of 

the first importance if we are to avoid from time to time a state 

of affairs which may create real difficulties, particularly of 

public opinion, in the various Empire countries.

I frankly recognise the complexities of the problem.

TO FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS ONLY:

Your own superb work in South Africa fills me with unqualified 

admiration, but it may be that the nature of your problems will 

not permit a long absence from your own country. I hope that this 

is not so.

TO MR. MACKENZIE KING ONLY:

I well remember our discussion on these matters when I had the 

honour of seeing you at Ottawa, and I know your own problems and 

point of view.

CONTINUE TO BOTH:-Nevertheless, I feel that if we could all be in 

London at the one time for a short meeting of Dominion Prime 

Ministers we could jointly exercise a powerful influence in the 

re-shaping of the machinery of central control and out of such a 

conference we might be able to evolve not some practical 

impossibility like an Imperial War Cabinet but effective Dominions 

representation in a British War Cabinet, reduced in size and so 

constituted as to bring about the results of which I have written 

above.

Please do not think that in making these suggestions I am in any 

way proposing something which would be calculated to weaken the 

position or authority of the leader. On the contrary, I feel that 

he is so outstanding and important to all of us that he must be 

given the greatest possible help in such a way as to secure the 

maximum united effort on the part of all British countries.

There is some reason to believe that Fraser [3] could be induced 

to remain in London until the end of August. My own political 

difficulties are considerable, since I have a practically non-

existent majority, but I would be prepared to take any political 

risk at home if by going to London for the suggested conference I 

could contribute to what I feel is an essential change.

I would be glad to have quite confidentially to myself your own 

impressions on these matters. [4]

Kindest regards.

I have communicated in similar terms with Mr. Mackenzie King/Field 

Marshal Smuts.

4 Smuts replied on 10 July (cablegram 40, AA : A3195, 1941, 

[1.12021]) that although he agreed that the holding of an Imperial 

war conference in London would be highly desirable he could not 

leave South Africa until later in the year. He doubted the wisdom 

of including a Dominion Prime Minister as a permanent member of 

the U.K. War Cabinet and made it clear that he believed it was 

Churchill's right to decide the membership of that body. He also 

pointed out that because of the campaigns in Africa and the Middle 

East and the possibility of war in the Far East there was less 

reason to concentrate war leadership in London than there had been 

in the First World War.

Mackenzie King replied on 2 August (cablegram 2, AA : A3195, 1941, 

1.14055) that commitments in Canada ruled out any possibility of 

his attending a protracted Imperial war conference or joining an 

Imperial war cabinet. He believed that the existing machinery for 

consultation between the U.K. and Dominion Govts was adequate, 

that there was not a clearly defined 'Dominions' as opposed to 

'United Kingdom' viewpoint which could be satisfactorily 

represented in London by one Dominion Prime Minister and that 

although the individual burden carried by Churchill was far too 

great he could only be relieved of it by his own action or by that 

of the British Parliament and people. The cablegram is published 

in Documents on Canadian External Relations, vol. VII, Department 

of External Affairs, Ottawa, 1974, Document 588.
