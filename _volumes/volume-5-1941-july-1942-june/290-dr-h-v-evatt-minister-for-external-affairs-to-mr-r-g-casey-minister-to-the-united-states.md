# 290 Dr H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 95 CANBERRA, 21 January 1942

MOST SECRET IMMEDIATE

With further reference to my cablegram No. 65 [1] you may accept the following as guiding instructions on the subject of coloured troops:

Whilst the Advisory War Council decided that the Australian reaction to the despatch of negro troops to Australia would not be favourable (not be favourable) the composition of the forces that the U.S.A. Government might decide to despatch to Australia is a matter for that Government to determine. [2]

2\. If the U.S.A. Authorities find it necessary to include certain coloured labour units or a proportion of coloured troops in their forces it is not the desire of the Commonwealth Government to make any stipulations which might destroy the nature of the organisation of the Army formation.

3\. Never the less it is assumed that the U.S.A. Authorities, being aware of our views, will have regard to Australian susceptibilities in the numbers they decide to despatch.
