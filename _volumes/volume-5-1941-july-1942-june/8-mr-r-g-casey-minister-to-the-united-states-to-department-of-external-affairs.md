# 8 Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 562 (extract) WASHINGTON, 26 July 1941, 2 a.m.

MOST SECRET

My No. 559. [1] I saw Secretary of Navy. [2] He told me 

confidentially that naval arrangements under which the United 

States Navy take over the protection of merchant shipping in 

north-west Atlantic were well advanced and that this control would 

begin to come into operation possibly within a week and that this 

should provide appreciable relief to British Navy in Atlantic. He 

said, of course, the movements of British warships from the 

Atlantic to Singapore would be a matter for decision by the 

British Government. He said that the United States Government had 

no proposals in view for movements of any more American warships 

from the Pacific into the Atlantic. I understand from British 

sources that although the above-mentioned American control of 

north-west Atlantic may begin within a week it is unlikely to be 

fully established for two or even three weeks.

With reference to Prime Minister's telegram No. 80 [3] I can well 

understand your anxiety to get undertaking of armed support from 

United States Government in view of possibility of conflict in the 

Far East arising from the result of the joint economic action. 

However, I believe that it will be impossible to get such 

undertaking. I believe that events and not logic[al] [4] arguments 

will drive the United States into belligerency. However, I believe 

that the present moment is appropriate to seek to get a speeding 

up of the naval plans arrived at in the staff conversations in 

Washington in March 1941 [5] which entail a redistribution of 

naval forces as between the Atlantic and Singapore. As you will 

remember, the abovementioned plan entailed the movement of three 

United States capital ships from the Pacific into the Atlantic. 

This has already been done. The plan envisaged the movement of six 

British capital ships from the Atlantic to Singapore on the United 

States becoming belligerent and on the threat of war in the Far 

East.
