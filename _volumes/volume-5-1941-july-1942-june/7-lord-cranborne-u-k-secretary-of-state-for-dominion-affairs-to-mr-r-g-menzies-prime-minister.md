# 7 Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Circular cablegram M151 LONDON, 12 July 1941, 11.51 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Following for Prime Minister.

My Circular M.140. [1]

JAPAN

Possible denunciation of Commercial Treaty [2] in the event of 

further southward movement by Japan was one of the suggestions 

upon which the views of Dominion Governments were invited in my 

telegram D.182 of April 5th. [3] Main points made in the replies 

received to those suggestions were: -

(1) The importance of suiting the action to the circumstances as 

they arise and avoiding provocative measures which might do more 

harm than good.

(2) The importance of securing United States co-operation in any 

retaliatory measures which might be contemplated.

As regards the Commercial Treaty the general view expressed was 

that in the circumstances envisaged, denunciation might have 

little to commend development [sic] except from the point of view 

of bringing us into line with the United States. The Canadian 

Government for their part expressed doubts as to the wisdom of 

such action if taken as a reprisal and suggested that it might be 

preferable if notice of termination could be given in a moment of 

comparative calm. The Commonwealth Government felt that there was 

some risk of denunciation being regarded as an irritant and 

suggested that counter action in the economic sphere could more 

effectively be provided by the adoption of joint policy of import 

restrictions in co-operation with the United States Government. 

[4] Alternatively the suggestion put forward in my telegram that 

the situation might best be met by placing Mitsui, Mitsubishi or 

Okura on the Black or Statutory List was felt to have [sic] rise 

to strong objections at least as far as the two former companies 

are concerned and was generally viewed with disfavour.

(2) We have given most careful consideration to these views and 

suggestions of re-examining possible courses of action open to us. 

In deciding to recommend denunciation of the Commercial Treaty 

notwithstanding doubts previously expressed, we have been 

influenced by the manner in which the situation has developed in 

the last few months and by the need for meeting any further 

Japanese move by a measure which could both be put into effect 

without delay and would at the same time afford unmistakable 

evidence of our reactions. We fully recognise that the practical 

importance of this step would be small but do not consider that it 

could be regarded as provocative. On the other hand we have reason 

to believe that the psychological effects in Japan would be 

greater and would bring home especially to the trading community 

the perils of bad leadership. This has also been the opinion of 

His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo. [5] We further consider it most 

important to bring ourselves fully into line with the United 

States in this matter.

(3) We very much hope therefore that on reconsideration His 

Majesty's Governments in the Dominions will feel able to concur in 

our taking this step as soon as the moment is judged opportune. 

Although we should wish to proceed with denunciation of the treaty 

at very short interval after the Japanese move into Southern Indo-

China we agree with the view previously expressed by the Canadian 

Government that it should not be represented as a reprisal and 

would propose that notice should be based on the grounds that 

Japanese restrictions on British trade and changing conditions 

have made continuation of the treaty pointless.

(4) A very early reply would be appreciated since the latest 

indications are that the Japanese move may be imminent. As to the 

general United States attitude please see my circular M.149 of 

today. [6]

In the meantime we are further exploring the possibilities in the 

direction of import restrictions as suggested by the Commonwealth 

Government but the matter is complicated by the varying conditions 

of parts of the Empire and it is clear that the preparation of 

suitable scheme would not [be?] free from difficulty. His 

Majesty's Ambassador at Washington [7] is however being asked to 

elicit view of United States authorities as to the prospects of 

their being able to co-operate in this field.
