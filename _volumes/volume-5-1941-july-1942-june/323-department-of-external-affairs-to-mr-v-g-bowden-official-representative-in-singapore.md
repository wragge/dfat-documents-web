Cablegram 82 CANBERRA, 10 February 1942

SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE CLEAR THE LINE

We appreciate your difficulties but think you should stick to your post.

Otherwise we shall be deprived of independent information and effect on morale would be bad.

Will communicate again within twelve hours.

We deeply value what you have done for Australia and her soldiers and we know you will continue to safeguard Australia's interests whatever may befall. Very best wishes.
