# 304 Mr F. M. Forde, Deputy Prime Minister, to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 81 [1] CANBERRA, 26 January 1942

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister [2] from the Prime Minister. [3]

With further reference to my telegram 74 [4] it is noted from cablegram No. 45 from the New Zealand Government [5], which has been repeated to us, that reference is made to Dominion membership of the United Kingdom War Cabinet 'as this is in effect accorded to Australia'.

2\. We are, of course, unaware of the terms of your communication to New Zealand, but we wish it to be quite clear that our request in cablegram No. 68 [6] implied and meant full membership of the United Kingdom War Cabinet with all rights and privileges unless and until an Imperial War Cabinet is constituted.

3\. We would be glad of early answer on Pacific Council scheme and note that New Zealand Government seems to be in substantial agreement with us.

FORDE
