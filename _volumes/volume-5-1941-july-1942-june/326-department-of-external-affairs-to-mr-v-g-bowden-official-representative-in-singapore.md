Cablegram 87 CANBERRA, 11 February 1942

SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE

If worst comes, you and your staff are to insist on receiving full diplomatic immunities, privileges and courtesies. Status given you by Commonwealth Government and accepted by United Kingdom Government is diplomatic with designation of Official Representative.

Through Protecting Power we shall insist on you and your staff being included in any evacuation scheme agreed on with Japanese Government.

We are endeavouring to arrange such a scheme, but Australian officials still held in Japan, while Japanese officials remain in Australia. If necessary, show paraphrase (repeat paraphrase) of this to Japanese administration.

Acknowledge this. [1]
