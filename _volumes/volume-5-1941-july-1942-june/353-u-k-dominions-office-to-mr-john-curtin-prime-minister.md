# 353 U.K. Dominions Office to Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister

Cablegram 235 LONDON, 21 February 1942, 1.25 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

My telegram of 20th February No. 233. [1]

Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister. [2]

I have received the following telegram from President of United States. Begins.

I hope you can persuade Australian Government to allow proposed temporary diversion of their leading Australian Division to Burma.

I think this of utmost importance. Tell them I am speeding additional troops as well as planes to Australia and that my estimate of the situation there is highly optimistic and by no means dark. Roosevelt. Ends.
