# 4 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in the United Kingdom

Cablegram 3649 (extract) CANBERRA, 10 July 1941

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

For the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. [1]

Prior to the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Russia, 

we had been reviewing the position that had been reached in regard 

to economic policy towards Japan. We were about to suggest to you 

that the various economic measures in operation and in 

contemplation be considered in relation to foreign policy, and 

that the possible effects on our political relationships with 

Japan, and our preparedness for any aggressive move by Japan, be 

summed up. [2]

At the time we had before us your proposal that we should reduce 

our lead exports to Japan to 2,500 tons annually [3], and we were 

also considering the Japanese requests for copra and wheat, and 

your views in regard to them. [4] Our general attitude was that we 

were prepared to cooperate in regard to these matters, provided 

the action proposed was valuable in securing United States co-

operation, and was part of a carefully weighed plan with adequate 

safeguards for us. We were, however, apprehensive regarding the 

effect of the proposed action on our relations with Japan, 

particularly in regard to copra, large quantities of which are 

lying on many undefended beaches in the Pacific.

When Germany attacked Russia, we suspended action while awaiting 

developments. Since then we have studied with interest your 

several telegrams on the subject [5], and have noted your 

instructions to His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo. [6] You mention 

in your telegram of 4th July, Circular D.396, that the Japanese 

Embassy have pressed the request for copra from New Guinea, and 

have referred to the effect of the closing of the Siberian railway 

on the possibility of re-export. The Japanese Minister in 

Australia has made a similar request to us. [7]

The Australian Minister at Tokyo has expressed to us views similar 

to those forwarded to you by His Majesty's Ambassador. Sir John 

Latham recently advised us that, while there is a strong case on 

economic grounds for the restrictions on further food supplies, a 

political assessment of the position must have regard to the fact 

that the Japanese people are short of rice, wheat and food oil. 

Our Minister points out that it would be possible to work up 

indignation against the Empire for denying supplies in view of the 

fact that Netherlands East Indies and United States are allowing 

supplies of oil and wheat to go to Japan. [8] (We know of course 

that the exports of copra from Netherlands East Indies are very 

small, but we are not clear regarding current exports from 

Philippine Islands.)

While our Minister advises us to permit small supplies of 

foodstuffs to go forward, we are trying to postpone a decision as 

long as possible. In the meantime we would very much appreciate 

advice whether, in deciding on measures against Japan in the 

sphere of economic warfare, you feel that we must take a chance as 

to Japan's reactions, which may be bitter and may appear well 

founded, and whether you consider that effective means of 

countering any aggressive action by Japan are available, including 

United States collaboration. In this regard we have noted the 

relevant portion of your telegram of 6th July, Circular D.399. [9]
