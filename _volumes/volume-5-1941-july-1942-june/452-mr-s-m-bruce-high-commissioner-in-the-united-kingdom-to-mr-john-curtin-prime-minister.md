# 452 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, to Mr John Curtin, Prime Minister

Cablegram 54A LONDON, 2 April 1942

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET HIMSELF

No doubt Evatt [1] has kept you fully informed of the very full exchange of communications I have been having with him and of recent developments. I feel however I should let you know personally that in my contacts with Churchill during this last week, and in particular an hour's frank talk which I had with him on Tuesday evening [2], I have been impressed with the fact that he has travelled a considerable way towards a better understanding of our position and our needs. I am hopeful that this will bear real fruit in the future.

BRUCE
