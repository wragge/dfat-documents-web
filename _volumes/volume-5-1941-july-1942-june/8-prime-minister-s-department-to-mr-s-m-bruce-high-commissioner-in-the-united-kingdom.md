# 8 Prime Minister's Department to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in the United Kingdom

Cablegram 3769 [1],

MOST SECRET &amp;amp; IMMEDIATE

CANBERRA, 16 July 1941

Following for the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. [2]

Reference your M.151. [3]

We have given careful consideration to your views but we are not 

convinced that your proposed course of action is correct.

In paragraph (2) you refer to denunciation as something which 

would 'afford unmistakable evidence of our reactions' and again 

that 'the psychological effects on Japan would be great'.

At the same time, in paragraph (3), you appear to accept the 

Canadian view that denunciation should not be represented as a 

reprisal and that it should be based on commercial grounds. We 

cannot reconcile these two things.

We think that the denunciation would plainly be regarded by all 

parties as a reprisal and as a pretty ineffective one. We see no 

value in economic measures against Japan which are merely 

pinpricks and do not exercise a material influence upon Japanese 

economy, and through it Japanese policy. That is why we suggested 

that if economic action was envisaged as reprisal it should take 

the form of severe restrictions on imports from Japan by all 

countries. Such action would, on our latest information, fit in 

very well with what the U.S.A. proposes to do in the same event.

If and when Japan makes anticipated move into Indo-China, whether 

such move be with or without the concurrence of Vichy, then 

following steps would in our opinion be appropriate:-

(a) Immediate denunciation of Treaty [4] without attempt at 

justification on commercial grounds;

(b) The denunciation to be followed as quickly as possible by 

intensified import and export restrictions or complete economic 

embargo subject in either case to the United States being prepared 

to act concurrently with us.

We would of course be most happy to consider any further argument 

you might care to advance but frankly we are not convinced by 

those adduced in the cable under reply.
