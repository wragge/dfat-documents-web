# 36 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in the United Kingdom

Cablegram 4339 CANBERRA, [9 August 1941] [1]

SECRET

Reference your 615 -Free French. [2] We are concerned at decision that d'Argenlieu is to be appointed as High Commissioner for the Western Pacific with headquarters at Noumea.

Ballard reports that administration in New Caledonia is running satisfactorily and that political position, unlike Tahiti, is now quite stable. [3] Sautot [4] is popular and present appointment will be blow to his prestige and to New Caledonian pride.

Ballard suspects that intriguing of Bayardelle [5] and reports of Brunot [6] are at back of decision. Our information as to activities of Brunet, especially in Tahiti, all suggest[s] he is most disturbing factor and that sooner he is recalled the better.

As you may be aware, he has re-instated Edmonds [7] and Foreign Office has ordered Archer [8] now in Canberra to proceed to Tahiti as a career consul.

Our aim, apart from maintaining the economic position, has been to promote political stability in French Oceania and in our view the appointment of high officials from outside who are not conversant with local conditions, and with the characteristics of a people who differ greatly from those in metropolitan France and other parts of French Colonial Empire, does not assist us in this objective.

Glad if you would bring above views to the notice of United Kingdom Government and to Free French Headquarters.

[MENZIES] [9]
