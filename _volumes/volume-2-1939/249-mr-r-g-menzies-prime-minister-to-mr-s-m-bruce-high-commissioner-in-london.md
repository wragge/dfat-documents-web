# 249 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered (extract) 28 September 1939,

MOST SECRET PERSONAL

Reference previous telegrams, would like you to reconsider Washington proposition further with idea that Casey [1] might go to London as High Commissioner.

Regarding British Government's invitation to send a Minister on a brief visit, with military and air officers, I will shortly forward name of Minister. In the meantime would it be safe for me to announce that Minister is going to London, or does the British Government wish to make simultaneous announcement in regard to all Dominions.

MENZIES

_

1 R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development.
