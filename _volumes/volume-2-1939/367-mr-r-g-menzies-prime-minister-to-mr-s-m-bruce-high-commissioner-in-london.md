## Cablegram unnumbered 17 November 1939,

Your telegram of 16th November, War Aims. [1] My telegram No. 165 to Secretary of State [2] may be regarded as contribution to general discussion. Its purpose has been served if the points made are now more prominently in the minds of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.

I may mention that I have forwarded copy of my telegram No. 165 to the Prime Ministers of the various Dominions.
