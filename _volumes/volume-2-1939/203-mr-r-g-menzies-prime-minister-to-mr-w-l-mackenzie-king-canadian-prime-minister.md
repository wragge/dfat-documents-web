# 203 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr W.L. Mackenzie King, Canadian Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered 6 September 1939,

Your telegram No. 7, 3rd September [1] His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is in entire agreement with view of His Majesty's Government in Canada that an exchange of High Commissioners between Ottawa and Canberra would strengthen materially means of intercourse and co-operation between the two Dominions in the difficult period ahead. It would therefore welcome cordially the appointment of a Canadian High Commissioner in Canberra at an early date and intends for its part to make a reciprocal appointment of an Australian High Commissioner to Canada as soon as necessary arrangements can be completed.

Announcement of the Government's decision to this effect will be made by me in the House of Representatives tomorrow September 7 [2] to coincide with announcement to be made by His Majesty's Government in Canada, as I understand from your telegram, on the same date.

PRIME MINISTER
