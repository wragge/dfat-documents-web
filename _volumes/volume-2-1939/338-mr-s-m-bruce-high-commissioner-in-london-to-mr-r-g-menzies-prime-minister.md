# 338 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 632 LONDON, 9 November 1939

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY

Washington. In conversations with Casey [1] the only reference I made to him personally of the position was to say 'I was under the impression that you had in mind that he might be willing to go to Washington.' From his remarks I greatly doubt if he would be, but this impression may be wrong, as I did not like to pursue the matter, feeling myself on somewhat delicate ground in view of the statement of your cable of 18th October. [2]

BRUCE
