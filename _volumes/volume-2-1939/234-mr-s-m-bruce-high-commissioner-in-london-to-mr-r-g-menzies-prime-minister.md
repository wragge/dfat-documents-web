# 234 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 19 September 1939

MOST SECRET PERSONAL HIMSELF

In event of your sending Minister to London I think most inadvisable Hughes [1] should come. I know Prime Minister [2] is of same opinion.

BRUCE

1 W.M. Hughes, Attorney-General and Minister for Industry.

2 Neville Chamberlain.
