# 92 Mr A.T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 188 LONDON, 20 May 1939

SECRET

My telegram No. 176. [1] Czechoslovakia. The British Charge d'Affaires at Prague [2] has been instructed to make arrangements to close the Legation and leave Prague on or before 25th May. The question of future representation at Prague still not finalised.

The United Kingdom Government feel obliged to have a ConsulGeneral at Prague and wish to apply to the German Government for an exequatur [3] without delay while making it clear that this is not considered to amount to more than de facto recognition of the new status of Bohemia and Moravia. The United Kingdom Government are still consulting the French Government with whom they wish to act in step.
