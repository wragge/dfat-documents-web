# 6 Mr W.M. Hughes, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr J.A. Lyons, Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered SYDNEY, 17 January 1939

Professor Meldrum's [sic] letter [1] hardly calls for comment. It contains nothing new. With some of it I violently disagree. I strongly advise taking no notice whatever of it. Will write on my return from Western tour. [2] Regards.

HUGHES
