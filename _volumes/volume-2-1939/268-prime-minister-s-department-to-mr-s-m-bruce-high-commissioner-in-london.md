Cablegram unnumbered 7 October 1939,

MOST SECRET

Your telegram 6th October. [1]

We have no detailed comment to offer on Hitler's speech. But in general we regard it as in no way altering the circumstances in which we are at war with Germany or as providing grounds for peace. Hitler's proposals appear to us to carry no assurances whatever of any lasting change in either the aims or the methods hitherto pursued by the present German Government. These being our views we are satisfied to leave the preparation of a reply to the United Kingdom Government.
