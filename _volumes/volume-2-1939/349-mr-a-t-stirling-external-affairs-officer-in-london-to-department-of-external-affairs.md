# 349 Mr A.T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 639 LONDON, 10 November 1939, 9.30 p.m.

MOST SECRET

TIMOR From secret but entirely trustworthy source learned that the Japanese Minister at Lisbon' is frequently telegraphing to his Government regarding possible developments in the concessions in Timor. He often mentions Banco Ultramarino and also a Companhia Ultramarina de Petroleo which are apparently Portuguese concerns.

He seems to think that these will get concessions and want to link up NANYO company with them. His messages, which are of considerable length and obscurity, boil down to this:

'We must keep on and if possible turn developments to our advantage.'

STIRLING
