# 121 Commonwealth Government to Sir Walford Selby, U.K. Ambassador to Portugal

## Cablegram unnumbered 18 July 1939,

Your telegram of 31st May [1], Timor concessions. Commonwealth Government appreciates assistance you have rendered. It appears the Australian company has received certain advice that it will receive a concession but there is doubt as to what the present position actually is.

Would be glad if you could clarify and do anything further to advance final decision.
