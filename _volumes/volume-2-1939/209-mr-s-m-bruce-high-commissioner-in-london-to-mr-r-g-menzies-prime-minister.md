# 209 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 430 LONDON, 7 September 1939, 10.59 a.m.

MOST SECRET

Canadian and New Zealand Governments have asked United Kingdom Government that Chiefs of General Staff should prepare an appreciation of most valuable form of military assistance that they could respectively render. United Kingdom Government asked me whether Australia would desire a similar appreciation prepared. I replied although we had clearly in our minds the line that we would have to follow having regard to Australia's own vital interests it would be of interest to us to learn the views of the General Staff. The appreciation has accordingly been prepared and is going to you through Whiskard [1] tonight.

BRUCE
