# 266 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr A. Eden, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

## Cablegram 128 6 October 1939,

I have issued the following statement to Australian press this afternoon begins- 'The report which has appeared in certain newspapers this morning of a projected meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers in London next year is due to a misunderstanding of something said by me yesterday.

When asked whether I would be the Minister to go to London I said "No", but indicated unofficially in answer to a question that at a later stage of the war the precedent established in the last war when Dominion Prime Ministers attended in London might conceivably be followed.

I might add that no arrangement, tentative or otherwise, has been made for me to go to London. I have plenty to do here.' (Statement ends).

MENZIES
