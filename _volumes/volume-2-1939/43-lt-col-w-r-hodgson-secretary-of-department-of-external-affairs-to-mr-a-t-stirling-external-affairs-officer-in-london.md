# 43 Lt Col W.R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, to Mr A.T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London

Cablegram 12 20 March 1939,

SECRET

Consul General Czechoslovakia [1] reports he received visit this morning from Consul General of Germany [2] who stated that on instructions from Foreign Office Berlin he requested the Consulate to be handed over. Consul General said he had no instructions and would have to refer to his Government but Asmis retorted he would not receive any reply as Czech Foreign Office had ceased to exist and matter would merely be referred to Berlin.

Desire you ascertain urgently whether demands for handing over Legations and Consulates have been made in United Kingdom and elsewhere and what is the attitude United Kingdom Government is adopting.

HODGSON
