# 313 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 28 October 1939

TO THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF

Your telegram 27th October. [1]

Hope cable you on Monday definite suggestions on procedure and form of announcement. [2] At the moment my mind tends to my being specially accredited to the United States (an analogy which U.S.

practises of appointing Ambassadors at large for special Missions) to establish Legation and make arrangements for transfer of diplomatic representation from the United Kingdom Embassy.

BRUCE
