Minute 196 Week commencing 20 November 1939,

SALE OF WHEAT TO JAPAN

In view of the negotiations which had taken place between the Wheat Board and Mitsui, which appeared to have committed the Government, in substance, to the transaction, it was agreed that the contract be proceeded with; but that it be made plain to the Wheat Board that in future any proposed sales on other than ordinary commercial terms must be submitted to Cabinet for approval before any steps are taken which might commit the Government.
