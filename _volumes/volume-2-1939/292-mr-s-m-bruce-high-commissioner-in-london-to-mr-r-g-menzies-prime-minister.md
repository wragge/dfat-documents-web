# 292 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 556 (extract) LONDON, 13 October 1939, 6.36 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Information received today points to German Government interpreting the Prime Minister's statement [1] as closing the door and as expressed from one source that the war has now begun.

If accurate, reactions are contrary to War Cabinet's anticipation, but position very obscure.

BRUCE
