# 255 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 30 September 1939,

MOST SECRET

I would be most grateful if you would convey to the British Government our request for advice at the earliest possible moment as to military position which would be created in the event of Russia declaring war and co-operating with Germany in military action.

Would be grateful also if British Government could advise me at early date as to reply it is proposed to make if and when the pronouncement made today with regard to Soviet-German agreement is followed by definite action.

MENZIES
