Cablegram unnumbered 30 November 1939,

My telegram 23rd November, League of Nations.' Commonwealth Government desires McDougall [2] express views to Fourth Committee along lines indicated in my telegram of 21st October, 1939 [3], and especially to include the following points:-

Commonwealth Government has examined Revised League Budget 1940.

While appreciative of efforts made to curtail League expenditure by reduction 33 1/3%, Australia will obtain no actual benefit owing to exchange situation and effect of withdrawals by certain countries from membership of League. Commonwealth Government feels bound, therefore, in existing war circumstances to insist upon further substantial reduction in proposed League expenditure for 1940, especially in connection with League Secretariat and political activities.
