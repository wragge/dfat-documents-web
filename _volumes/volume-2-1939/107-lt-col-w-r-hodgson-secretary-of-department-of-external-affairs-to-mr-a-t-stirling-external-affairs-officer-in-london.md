## Cablegram 40 22 June 1939, 4.20 p.m.

Reference de facto recognition of German occupation Czechoslovakia. Question of recognition by Commonwealth Government is under consideration. Glad if you would make enquiries and advise what steps if any being taken by British Government as to withdrawal recognition Czech Consuls and as to German consular representatives in United Kingdom, especially whether new exequaturs will be issued to them or written intimation only that they will be recognized as having jurisdiction pertaining to Czech citizens. Further what would be appropriate procedure for us in event either alternative being adopted.
