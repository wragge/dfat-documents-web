# 323 Sir Walford Selby, U.K. Ambassador to Portugal, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Letter LISBON, 2 November 1939

With reference to your telegram of the 17th August [1] I have the honour to report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that although they have not yet succeeded in obtaining the views of the competent Portuguese authorities on the draft agreement for the establishment of a Timor-Australia air service, they are endeavouring to do so with all possible despatch.

W. SELBY
