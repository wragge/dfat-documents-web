# 320 Mr R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 1 November 1939

MOST SECRET

Very sorry to hear of the difficulties you are facing [1] but at this distance it is impossible to express any views that might help you in the difficult decision you have to make. As regards myself the question is whether my services can best be used in America. I recognise the importance of Washington and I believe I could do useful work there. On the other hand with the knowledge I have acquired here, I feel that I could be of some assistance to you in the serious times that lie ahead. So between the two my judgment is that I could render more valuable service in Australia. The question however is one for you to decide and if you feel it is desirable that I should go to Washington, I am prepared to fall in with your wishes. In the event of your so deciding, and if it would facilitate any action you think necessary to take in connection with bringing the Country Party into the Government, the announcement could be made as and when you think proper.
