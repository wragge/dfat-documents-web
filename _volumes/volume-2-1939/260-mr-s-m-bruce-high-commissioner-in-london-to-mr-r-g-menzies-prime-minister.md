Cablegram 520 (extract) LONDON, 3 October 1939, 6.32 p.m.

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

General reaction to Prime Minister's statement favourable. [1] More important in my view is statement that will be made if and when definite peace proposals are put forward. Am continuing pressure to ensure preparation of replies to meet alternative forms of proposals and am assured that they are well advanced.

BRUCE

1 In the House of Commons on 3 October 1939 Neville Chamberlain described the GermanSoviet declaration on Poland as a 'suggestion of some proposal for peace with a scarcely veiled threat as to the consequences, if the proposal should be refused'. See House of Commons, Parliamentary Debates, fifth series, vol. 351, cols 1856- 62.
