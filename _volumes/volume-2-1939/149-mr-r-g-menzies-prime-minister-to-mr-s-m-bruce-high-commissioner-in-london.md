# 149 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

## Cablegram unnumbered 25 August 1939,

Reference your suggestion that I again cable Chamberlain [1], I feel that our position made clear by my cable to him on August 18th. [2] Moreover, his letter to Hitler seems to express position adequately. [3]

You may inform United Kingdom Government, however, that while our attitude of co-operation is as stated by me publicly on Wednesday [4] we would desire warmly to encourage a peaceful and just settlement to which Poland made genuine contribution.

We have taken preliminary steps under our War Book but public opinion steady and good.

MENZIES
