# 102 Sir Walford Selby, U.K. Ambassador to Portugal, to Commonwealth Government

## Cablegram unnumbered LISBON, 14 June 1939, 8.10 p.m.

My telegram of 31st May. [1] From the conversation I have had with the Minister for Colonies [2] I consider it important that we should proceed with the exchange of notes with the Portuguese Government for the establishment of the air service without delay.

When may I expect from you the draft text of the note you would wish me to exchange.

In order to strengthen his hands to resist possible Japanese application the Minister for Colonies suggests that you should apply for exclusive rights for the service.

We could attempt this if you think it expedient although I do not know as yet whether the Minister for Colonies reflects the views of his Government.
