# 302 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 19 October 1939

PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF

On re-reading my telegram [1], I feel that the final suggestion- which, in any event, you may regard as impracticable-might appear to qualify the preceding statement that I am prepared to fall in with your wishes.

This is not so. I leave it to you to determine where I shall be most useful.

If you decide for Washington, I would ask that appointment should only be for a limited period and that I should, in any event, return to London if serious negotiations were entered into for a peace settlement.

BRUCE
