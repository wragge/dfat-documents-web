2 On 5 October 1939 Lt Col W.R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, wrote to F. Strahan, Secretary of Prime minister's Department, to tell him that he had discussed with his Minister, Sir Henry Gullett, whether in view of the outbreak of war it was advisable to take action to implement the Cabinet decision. The Minister directed that, while the matter was to be kept in mind, no action was to be taken for the present. (See AA:

A981 Japan 100.) A similar decision was made by John McEwen, Minister for External Affairs, in 1940. (See Hodgson to Strahan, 3 August 1940, on file AA: A461, J345/1/3, iii.)
