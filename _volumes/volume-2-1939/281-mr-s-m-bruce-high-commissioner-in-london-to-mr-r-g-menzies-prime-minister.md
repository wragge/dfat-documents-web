# 281 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 545 LONDON, to October 1939, 8.03 p.m.

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

New draft being sent tonight [1] considerably improved but still in my view not sufficiently constructive and lacking appeal to our own people and neutrals so vital at present time. I am taking no further action pending the receipt of your cable referred to in your cable. [2] 

BRUCE
