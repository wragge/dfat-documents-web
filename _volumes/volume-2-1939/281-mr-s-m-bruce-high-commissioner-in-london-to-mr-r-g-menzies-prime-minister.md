Cablegram 545 LONDON, to October 1939, 8.03 p.m.

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

New draft being sent tonight [1] considerably improved but still in my view not sufficiently constructive and lacking appeal to our own people and neutrals so vital at present time. I am taking no further action pending the receipt of your cable referred to in your cable. [2] 

BRUCE
