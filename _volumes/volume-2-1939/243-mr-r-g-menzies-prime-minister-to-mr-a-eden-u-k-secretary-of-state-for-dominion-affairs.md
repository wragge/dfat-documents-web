MOST SECRET

I have received your cablegram of 21st September [1]

Your suggestions regarding sending a Minister to London with Military and Air Force officers are acceptable to me and I will notify you of the names in a few days. The appointment of Liaison Officers to supplement existing contacts with Civil Departments in Great Britain is under consideration.
