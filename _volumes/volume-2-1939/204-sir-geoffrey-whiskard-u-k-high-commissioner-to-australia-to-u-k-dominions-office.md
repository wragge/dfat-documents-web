# 204 Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, U.K. High Commissioner to Australia, to U.K. Dominions Office

Cablegram 184 (paraphrase) CANBERRA, 6 September 1939

SECRET

I understand that you have been informed by Bruce [1] of Mackenzie King's proposal to appoint a Canadian High Commissioner in Australia. [2]

Prime Minister [3] tells me that he warmly welcomes this proposal and that subject to any observations which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom may wish to make would wish to appoint Commonwealth High Commissioner not only in Canada but also in New Zealand and South Africa. [4]

He feels that direct contact between the Dominions as well as with the United Kingdom will strengthen the political structure of the Empire and should be encouraged. He is particularly anxious to work in the closest possible touch with New Zealand.
