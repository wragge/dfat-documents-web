# 228 Mr Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.S. President, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

## Letter WASHINGTON, 16 September 1939

I have received through the British Ambassador [1] your personal message of September seventh. [2]

May I say at once that I am glad to have, your views and that I fully appreciate the spirit which prompted you to send me this message. Earlier this year I endeavoured to bring about the repeal by Congress of the embargo provisions of our neutrality legislation. Congress finally decided to postpone the consideration of this matter in spite of the considered recommendations of the Secretary of State [3] and my own efforts.

As you know, the existing legislation becomes mandatory on the declaration of war.

I have just called The Congress into special session on September 21st to consider our neutrality legislation.

I recall with pleasure your visit here four years ago.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
