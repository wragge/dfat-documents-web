# 94 Mr A.T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 193 LONDON, 22 May 1939 SECRET

Dominions Office advise that the position as regards the inclusion of Bohemia and Moravia in customs area with Reich still remains as German Consul-General at Sydney [1] stated, viz.: that Czechoslovakia customs laws and frontier with Germany continue in force until otherwise decided.

As regards the attitude of the United Kingdom Government to its Trade Agreements with Czechoslovakia, the position is that it has not [been] thought necessary to apply special conditions to trade between United Kingdom and Czechoslovakia and it is hoped that customary trade conditions will continue until an agreement can be reached with the German authorities as to a permanent basis for an agreement for trade with the former territories of Czechoslovakia. The United Kingdom Government have not yet formulated their ideas as to the basis on which a permanent settlement should be sought. The procedure to be followed and the questions for negotiation depend largely on the decision reached as regards recognition, for the position of which please see my telegram No. 188. [2]
