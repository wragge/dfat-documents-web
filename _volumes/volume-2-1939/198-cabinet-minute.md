EXCHANGE OF HIGH COMMISSIONERS

A cablegram from the Prime Minister of Canada [1] was read by Mr Menzies [2], in which an immediate exchange of High Commissioners between Ottawa and Canberra was suggested. It was resolved that the Government of Canada be informed that Australia cordially concurs in the proposal.
