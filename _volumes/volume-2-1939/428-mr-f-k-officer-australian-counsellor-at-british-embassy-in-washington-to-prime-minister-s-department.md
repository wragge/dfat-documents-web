# 428 Mr F.K. Officer, Australian Counsellor at British Embassy in Washington, to Prime Minister's Department

## Cablegram unnumbered WASHINGTON, 25 December 1939, 9.15 p.m.

URGENT

This morning the New York Times contained as front page news unofficial but authoritative report from Melbourne of the appointment of Casey. [1] As the State Department may feel that we have not respected their desire to have advance advice of announcement so that they could make similar announcement here I would be glad to be in a position to explain.

OFFICER

_

1 R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development, who was to be Minister to the United States.
