# 140 Lt Col W.R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, to Mr A.T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London

Cablegram 51 22 August 1939,

CONFIDENTIAL

Personal for Stirling. Minister [1] desires me to inform you that cabinet [2] has been very embarrassed over failure to receive any reply to my most urgent message this morning. Press and wireless had early report of German announcement [3] which was being featured throughout world, and Government though subjected to pressure, was unable all day to make any statement as to actual facts of position.

Apparently there was some gap in the circuit of communication to you. Minister desires that some staff arrangements be made immediately to ensure that if most immediate messages are sent to you in morning Australian time that some reply will be received in reasonable time.

HODGSON
