# 275 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 542 LONDON, 10 October 1939, 2 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Reference my telegram No. 541. [1] Telegram has just been received from the Ambassador at Rome [2] emphasizing that Hitler's peace proposals [3] are obtaining increased support and urging that our reply must be of a constructive character, showing that we have definite peace aims that will benefit all nations, and refuting the growing impression that we are striving for the maintenance of status quo and that our victory will be followed by a vindictive peace.

BRUCE
