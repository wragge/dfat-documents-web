# 192 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr N. Chamberlain, U.K. Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered 4 September 1939,

Your broadcast message [l] moved Australia deeply. We ourselves have proclaimed a state of war and I have broadcast on behalf of the Commonwealth Government that we stand with Great Britain.

We firmly believe we have right on our side and in that strength victory is sure.
