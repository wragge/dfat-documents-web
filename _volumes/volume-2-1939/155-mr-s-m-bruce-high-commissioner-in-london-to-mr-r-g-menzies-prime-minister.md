# 155 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 359 LONDON, 27 August 1939, 12.30 a.m.

MOST SECRET FOR PRIME MINISTER

My immediately preceding telegram. [1] On arrival Henderson [2] in conference with the Prime Minister [3] and Halifax [4] over three hours. Subsequently Cabinet sat till nine p.m. and then adjourned till tomorrow Sunday morning. Proposed that Henderson should return with reply tomorrow afternoon. I gather Cabinet discussions fairly satisfactory to Prime Minister's working for reply on broad and liberal lines but some members difficult. As indicated in my previous cable I consider vital that reply down such lines and if you concur I would strongly urge that you should cable in time for Cabinet tomorrow your views as they would carry great weight and would strengthen the Prime Minister's hand.

BRUCE
