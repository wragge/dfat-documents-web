# 138 Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, U.K. High Commissioner to Australia, to U.K. Dominions Office

Cablegram 152 (paraphrase) CANBERRA, 21 August 1939

SECRET

My telegram No. 137 of the 18th July. [1] Today the Prime Minister [2] told me that he hopes the Cabinet will make a decision this week with regard to the person whom they wish should be appointed to Washington. He would then ask you to initiate procedure set out at the end of the message contained in your telegram No. 98 of the 29th April. [3]

He hopes that Sir David Rivett [4] will be the name to be submitted. Failing him he would like Sir Ernest Fisk. [5] In my opinion either appointment would be admirable.
