# 307 Mr A. Eden, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Circular Cablegram D52 LONDON, 24 October 1939, 10.09 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Following is a summary of a memorandum communicated on instructions by the French Ambassador [1] on October 23rd.

(2) The French Government suggest that an early exchange of views is desirable with His Majesty's Government on the problem of allied war aims.

(3) They consider essential that the allied war aims should be, together with reparation for violated rights and aggressions committed, to render it impossible for Germany to imperil again the peace of Europe by threats or the use of force. A change of Government or a repudiation of Hitlerian methods would not be sufficient; European security can no longer depend on the goodwill of Germany. Our principal war aim should be the establishment of effective material guarantees against any offensive return of German Imperialism and Germany's violation of engagements imposed on her. We must be careful in the present carrying-out of objectives lest we reunite the Germans behind Hitler [2] by threatening the unity or integrity of the Reich or by calling in question the very existence of the regime. At the same time the French Government are convinced that a frank exchange of views, in secret in the first place, as to the system of guarantees to be ultimately imposed on Germany, should enable us to find a solution by mutual agreement.
