# 337 Mr S.M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 631 LONDON, 9 November 1939

FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF

Washington. The position has developed in two directions. Upon my putting in the request to the Foreign Office to move Lothian [1] to approach the United States Govt., Eden [2] made strong representations to me against my leaving the United Kingdom even temporarily at the present time and asked my consent to his speaking to the Prime Minister [3] about it. This I gather he has now done and I have an impression, although of this I have no confirmation, that the Prime Minister is cabling you personally.

(2) I have now fully discussed the question with Casey [4] who has seen this cable. He feels that the final decision should remain in abeyance until you and he have the opportunity of discussing the question on his return.

In view of this and pending further instructions from you, I have asked the Foreign Office to advise Lothian not to approach the United States Government for the moment.

BRUCE
