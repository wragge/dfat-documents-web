FOR PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET

Your secret and personal just received. [1]

I think better that I should make no reference to people here on the subject of the Second division. Northcott's and my references in cables to you and Squires were our own respective views on the situation as disclosed to us. [2] Subject has not been mentioned to us by anyone here and we have not discussed it at all.
