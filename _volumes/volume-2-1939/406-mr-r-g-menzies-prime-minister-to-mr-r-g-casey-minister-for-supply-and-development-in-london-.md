# 406 Mr R.G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr R.G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development (in London)

Cablegram unnumbered 6 December 1939,

IMMEDIATE SECRET AND PERSONAL

Am asking Dominions Office to obtain permission from Washington for me to announce that early in New Year you will be appointed Minister to Washington.

Greatly appreciate your cable [1] and your willingness to serve wherever needed but on full reflection and discussion consider that you are out-standing for Washington post to which I attach enormous importance.

Have discussed it with Maie [2] who I think agrees.

Regards.

MENZIES
