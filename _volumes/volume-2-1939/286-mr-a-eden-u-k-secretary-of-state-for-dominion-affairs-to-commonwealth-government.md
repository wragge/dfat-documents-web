# 286 Mr A. Eden, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 128 (extract) LONDON, 11 October 1939, 11.39 p.m.

MOST SECRET

We are most grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions contained in your telegram No. 133 of 11th October [1] which was before the War Cabinet this morning when the draft statement was further examined. You will have seen from my telegram Circular D.36 [2] that the draft statements had already been revised in a sense which I feel sure you will agree corresponds with your observations.

Since the receipt of your telegram, the text has been further amended and will be considered finally at tomorrow morning's War Cabinet. This latest version incorporates some of the ideas and, in certain instances, the actual words used in the latter part of your telegram.
