Count Ciano [1] spoke last night to the British Ambassador at Rome [2] with great anxiety about press statements in whole London evening press to the effect that in the event of war Italy might remain neutral and even desert her ally. He asked that this might be stopped. The Ambassador has urged Foreign Office again most earnestly that British press should be discouraged from discussing Italy's attitude lest political action United Kingdom Government in regard to Italy be completely nullified. This most important.
