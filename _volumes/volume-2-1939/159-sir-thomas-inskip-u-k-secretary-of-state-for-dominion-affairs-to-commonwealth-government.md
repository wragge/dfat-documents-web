# 159 Sir Thomas Inskip, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Commonwealth Government

## Cablegram 86 LONDON, 28 August 1939, 6.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE

In view of the critical situation vis a vis Germany, and for reason which will fully be appreciated, including the protection of trade, the Admiralty have requested that ships of the Royal Australian Navy may be held in immediate readiness and, where applicable, may move towards their war stations in accordance with the dispositions in MOO-697/39-repeated-MOO 697/39.

2\. These measures would be similar to those already taken in relation to His Majesty's ships under control of the United Kingdom Government.
