# 7 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 507 LONDON, 3 July 1940, 8 p.m.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF ONLY

I am most disturbed at the lack of information supplied when 

advising you in Dominions Office telegram No. 22.8 [1] of complete 

reversal of the United Kingdom Government's naval policy in the 

Far East and asking you to undertake the serious commitment of 

sending a division to Malaya.

I have told the United Kingdom Government that personally I would 

flatly refuse to entertain their request unless I received a great 

deal more information as to United Kingdom appreciation of the 

situation resulting from French collapse and of their plans and 

strategy for the future conduct of the war.

In view of the attitude I have taken suggest that possibly the 

wisest course for you would be masterly inactivity for two or 

three days. If during that period I can get no satisfaction I feel 

that it will be necessary for you to send a strong cable to the 

Prime Minister [2] as it is essential that the United Kingdom 

Government should be [stunned] [3] by someone into facing the 

great and fundamental issues that now confront us, which in my 

view they are not doing.

BRUCE
