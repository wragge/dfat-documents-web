# 3 Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 234 LONDON, 2 July 1940, 5 a.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

War Cabinet this morning considered the Far Eastern situation and 

had before it your telegram 27th June No. 330 [1] for which we are 

much obliged.

After full consideration the War Cabinet came to the conclusion 

that it would be desirable to reply as follows to the Japanese 

demands.

(a) To agree to the withdrawal of the Shanghai garrison provided 

that Italy also withdraws and on the assumption that British lives 

and property will be protected and that Japanese Government will 

not seek to alter the status of the concession except in 

consultation with the parties concerned.

(b) To make enquiry as to the precise grounds for the complaint at 

Hong Kong, and,

(c) With regard to the Burmese Road he [2] is to point out that 

the passage of arms and ammunition does not offer any very 

material contribution to the armed strength of China; that war 

material from the United Kingdom has been insignificant in recent 

months and that owing to their own war effort His Majesty's 

Government in the United Kingdom are in fact unable to supply 

China with munitions of war. As to the stoppage of fuel, fuel oil 

and petrol, trucks and railway material, His Majesty's Government 

in the United Kingdom would state that in making this request the 

Japanese Government was asking them to take action inconsistent 

with their obligation to India and Burma, for whom the Burmese 

Road constitutes a legitimate trade route. [Relations] [3] with 

the United States would also be affected in as much as the route 

is largely used for United States products. It is proposed to [add 

that] in strict neutrality a request to cut off these materials 

from China should involve a similar stoppage of supplies to Japan 

though of course this is in no way the intention.

Finally, it is proposed to say that far from prolonging 

hostilities, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have 

deplored them and have on various occasions expressed their 

readiness, should both parties so desire, to use their endeavours 

to bring the conflict to a dose.

In arriving at the above conclusion, His Majesty's Government in 

the United Kingdom have been influenced by the fact that, while it 

is obviously desirable to avoid trouble with Japan at this moment, 

it is doubtful whether the concessions from [weakness] on points 

of principle, apart from other considerations, would bring any 

lasting improvement in the Anglo-Japanese relations. Furthermore, 

in any attempt to find a way of accommodation with Japan, care 

must be taken not to destroy confidence in the United States and 

China in the British policy.

As the Commonwealth Government are aware, the United States have 

indicated that they are prepared neither to increase pressure 

which might involve them in war nor to take the initiative in a 

policy of conciliation. On our part we are quite prepared to adopt 

the latter policy if it is capable of producing any results. But 

the United States Government appear to hold the view, which we are 

inclined to share, that the Japanese nation is in no mood to be 

weaned from a policy of aggression, and in these circumstances it 

seems more than likely that any concessions which we may show 

ourselves ready to make will fail to deter Japan from her 

objectives.

We are inclined to agree with Sir Robert Craigie that a refusal to 

close the Burmese Road will not directly lead to war, and that the 

Japanese will in the first place have recourse to less violent 

measures. Unless Great Britain were to be defeated in the European 

conflict it seems to us doubtful whether Japan would have recourse 

to total war. Japan's resources are not inexhaustible and should 

she ultimately resort to hostilities it seems much more probable 

that they would be limited and local and that, provided we 

ourselves did not declare a state of war, she would terminate them 

whenever it became apparent that a further advance would tax her 

resources beyond their capacity. If Japan is bent on a policy of 

this kind, it is unlikely that anything can be done at this stage 

to deflect her. Nevertheless, Sir Robert Craigie has been 

authorized to explore the possibilities and if these exist, His 

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will naturally do what 

they can in consultation with the Dominion Governments to exploit 

them.

In the light of the above and in view of the very bad effect which 

the closing of the Burmese Road would have upon India, Burma and 

Malaya, which would be directly affected, we feel that we should 

not close the Burmese Road.

We fully appreciate the considerations advanced by the 

Commonwealth Government from the point of view of Australia. It 

will be understood that it is necessary for us to take into 

account all the relevant factors, and we hope that in the light of 

the wider considerations mentioned above, the Commonwealth 

Government will feel able to concur in the terms of the reply 

which it is proposed to [send] to Japan. We should be grateful for 

a very early reply. [4]

We are repeating your telegram and this reply to His Majesty's 

Governments in Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, 

with a request for any observations so far as they are concerned.
