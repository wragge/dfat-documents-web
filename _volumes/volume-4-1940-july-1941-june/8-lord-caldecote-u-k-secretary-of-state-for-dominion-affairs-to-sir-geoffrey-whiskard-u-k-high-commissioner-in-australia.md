# 8 Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, U.K. High Commissioner in Australia

Circular cablegram Z168 LONDON, 3 July 1940, 5.10 p.m.

IMPORTANT MOST SECRET

Please communicate to the Prime Minister [1] for his Most Secret 

and Personal information the following appreciation of the 

military position in the Middle East which has been prepared by 

the Chiefs of Staff. It is being communicated also to His 

Majesty's Ambassador at Cairo [2], Commander in Chief India [3], 

and Commanders in Chief of the Middle East [4] and the 

Mediterranean. [5]

(begins).

The retention of our position in the Middle East remains of the 

utmost importance to the successful prosecution of the war, 

particularly in view of our policy of an economic blockade of 

Europe. It is also important to secure the Anglo-Iranian oil 

fields.

2\. The security of the Middle East hinges on the defence of.-

(a) Egypt and Sudan, where our main forces are based, our Middle 

East communications are centred, and the Suez Canal is controlled.

(b) Iraq, from which we must control the oil of Iraq and Iran and 

safeguard the Baghdad-Haifa route.

(c) Palestine, which is now our most northerly defensive position 

and contains the western terminus of the Baghdad route.

(d) Aden, which is essential to our Red Sea lines of 

communication.

(e) Kenya, which is our second line of defence in Africa, a 

valuable base of operations against Italian East Africa and 

contains a second alternative line of communication to Egypt via 

Mombasa.

3\. It is of first importance that the Red Sea route should be 

rendered secure as soon as possible and very considerable success 

has already been achieved in reducing the Italian air and 

submarine threats to it. Development of air route to route 

Nigeria-Geneina (Sudan) as reinforcement route for aircraft and 

light stores to Egypt is being pressed on, as is work on Baghdad 

and Mombasa alternative routes.

4\. Our policy in the Middle East must at present be generally 

defensive although every chance of taking local offensive action 

will be continued. Although difficulties of terrain, climate and 

communications in Libya are limiting factors, the possibility of 

attack on Egypt by German forces from this area is undoubtedly a 

serious threat calling for increased scale of defence. Our present 

forces are sufficient to deal with any purely Italian attack as 

long as we can retain the Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. The 

Italians could now muster between 300 and 400 bombers in Libya but 

their morale is indifferent and maintenance poor. Although the 

German Air Force is likely to be fully occupied in the near future 

in attacks on the United Kingdom, their participation in air 

attack on Egypt is not impossible and Alexandria might be rendered 

untenable as Fleet base.

5\. It is hoped that Turkey would oppose a German or Italian attack 

through the Balkans on the Middle East. Although we cannot rely on 

her to offer prolonged resistance, the threat to the Middle East 

from this direction is comparatively a long term one. It is 

important that Syria should not fall into enemy occupation. If the 

status quo is to be disturbed by our enemies it is clearly 

desirable that Turkey should resist. From the military point of 

view the Turkish occupation of Syria would have much to commend it 

though there would be political disadvantages.

6\. The defence of Iraq is compromised by the situation in Syria 

also by the possibility of disturbance of the internal situation 

and by the growing hostility of Iran. Subject to agreement with 

Iraq Government it is intended to reinforce Iraq with one division 

from India.

7\. Although we cannot count on the continuance of French 

resistance at Djibouti, the success of our action against Italian 

air and submarine threats promises well for the future security of 

the Red Sea route.

8\. It is intended to retain the fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean 

as long as possible.

9\. For the above reasons it is clearly necessary to strengthen our 

defence forces in the Middle East at the earliest possible moment. 

The situation is, however, governed by the probability of large 

scale air offensive and even invasion of this country in the near 

future and shortages of equipment to meet these threats. Our 

policy must therefore be to concentrate our immediate efforts on 

the defence of the United Kingdom and to start releasing equipment 

for the Middle East when we can more clearly judge the situation 

following the impending trial of strength here. This may not be 

for two months, meanwhile we shall endeavour to send anything we 

can spare, including if possible modern fighters, to re-equip 

squadrons in Egypt and bombers to replace wastage. [6]

6 A supplement to this appreciation was received in cablegram Z183 

dispatched on 13 July. It reported that the threat of invasion of 

the United Kingdom was likely to end in September and the enemy 

might then turn his attention to the Middle East, where major 

operations were anticipated throughout the autumn and winter of 

1940-41. It was hoped that the 6th Australian and 2nd New Zealand 

Divisions could be reconstituted in the Middle East by the autumn 

or early winter and that the Commonwealth and N.Z. Govts should 

continue to prepare reinforcements for dispatch to the Middle East
