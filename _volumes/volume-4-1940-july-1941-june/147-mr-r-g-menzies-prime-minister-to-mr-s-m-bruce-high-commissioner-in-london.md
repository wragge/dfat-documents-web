# 147 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram 439 1 October 1940,

MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL

We have again been embarrassed by a premature announcement by the B.B.C. this morning of the arrival of R.A.A.F. Squadrons at Singapore and the press here have cablegrams from Singapore giving details of the R.A.A.F. Squadrons.

It will be recalled from cablegram 358 of 8th July to the Dominions Office [1] that it was considered most important that no publicity be given in the United Kingdom or elsewhere of the arrival of R.A.A.F. aircraft and personnel in Singapore. Recently the Department of Air made an enquiry through the Air Liaison Officer, London [2], as to the views of the Air Ministry on the release of the information and it was stated there were no objections provided it was made in a form to safeguard Japanese susceptibilities. The subject was under consideration when information of the release was received.

As this is the eighth complaint which we have had to make regarding action by the B.B.C., it is desired that you press the United Kingdom Government for a satisfactory arrangement which will safeguard us against these recurring embarrassments.

MENZIES
