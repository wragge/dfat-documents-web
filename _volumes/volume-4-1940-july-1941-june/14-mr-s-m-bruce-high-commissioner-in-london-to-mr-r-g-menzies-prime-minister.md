# 14 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 520 LONDON, 6 July 1940, 2.52 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL MOST SECRET

JAPAN. Chiefs of Staff appreciation strongly stressing 

impossibility of facing war with Japan was before the War Cabinet 

when reply further considered this afternoon. Discussion 

apparently inconclusive but understood that majority view 

necessary to give way on Burma road. As I believe a positive 

policy such as I have always advocated is best course, I made a 

last attempt even at this eleventh hour by putting in a memorandum 

which I made clear expressed solely my personal views down the 

following lines:

(i) If we do not give way there is danger of war.

(2) If we do give way probably not the end of Japanese demands.

(3) Give Craigie [1] instructions to put the position with 

absolute frankness down the following lines:

(a) We desire good relations and broad settlement.

(b) Cannot merely agree to Japanese demands because of the 

reactions of our own people to acquiescence in dictation and the 

effect on the United States.

While anxious for good relations with Japan we cannot purchase 

them at the price of losing American goodwill which is vital to us 

in our desperate struggle in Europe.

(c) If we did agree by no means certain would lead to the 

accomplishment of Japan's major objective, i.e., liquidation of 

China position.

(d) If we do not agree and war resulted Japanese position 

difficult because-

(a) though heavily engaged elsewhere the British Empire could 

still be troublesome.

(b) Danger of United States declaring war. While United States 

[public] [2] opinion bitter[ly opposed] to war in Europe large 

section regard Japan as danger in the Pacific Ocean and at any 

moment might swing in favour of hostilities.

(c) Damage financial and economic embargo of [sic] United States 

and British Empire would inflict.

(d) If we defeat Germany we would be strong enough to enforce 

retribution for any blackmail imposed on us now.

(e) If Germany defeated us and the Far Eastern position had not 

been stabilized Germany would certainly come into the Pacific 

Ocean.

(4) Having put reasons why trouble now would not suit Japan or us 

Craigie should be authorized to suggest a broad settlement down 

the following lines:

(1) United Kingdom prepared to use best endeavours to bring about 

a settlement in China provided that Japan prepared to agree to 

reasonable terms which safeguarded China's independence.

(2) If Japan prepared to agree to such terms and a settlement with 

China can be effected the United Kingdom Prepared-

(a) To afford financial assistance by way of loan up to an agreed 

amount on favourable terms if requested to do so.

(b) To co-operate in the rehabilitation and development of China 

and to agree to preferential opportunity for Japan in respect to 

supply of consumption goods to China.

(c) To endeavour to obtain co-operation of the United States in 

respect to (a) and (b).

(d) To discuss with Japan the stabilization of territorial 

position in the Far East and to endeavour to obtain the co-

operation of the United States, the Netherlands and France in a 

settlement.

(e) To assist in ensuring to Japan vital necessities in raw 

materials.

(f) To agree to the open door in non-selfgoverning territories and 

to discuss with Governments concerned increased opportunities for 

Japan in self-governing parts of the Empire.

(d) might involve handing over some islands to Japan and (f) the 

giving up of advantages British manufacturers have enjoyed in the 

colonial Empire. If the war is lost these are immaterial. If war 

is won the world will be constituted on so changed a basis that 

the former will probably be immaterial and the latter is almost 

certain to be the agreed settlement of the colonial problem.

Repeated to Washington No. 32.
