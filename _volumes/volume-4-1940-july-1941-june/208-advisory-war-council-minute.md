# 208 Advisory War Council Minute

## Minute 39 CANBERRA, 25 November 1940

SINGAPORE CONFERENCE The Prime Minister [1] referred to the alarming position in regard to the defence of Singapore, as revealed by the report of the recent Singapore Conference [2], and the probability that a request would be made to Australia for the despatch of a Brigade Group, together with certain essential supplies of munitions.

The Prime Minister stated that this and other matters which he had in mind indicated the necessity for the Head of the Government to visit London for a discussion with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. [3]

The idea met with general approval and the Prime Minister stated that he would consider the extent to which it might be possible to take Members of the Parliament into his confidence on this most secret matter.
