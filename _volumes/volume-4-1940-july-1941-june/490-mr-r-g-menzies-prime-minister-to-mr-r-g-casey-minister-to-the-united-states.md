# 490 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

## Cablegram 58 7 June 1941,

Your telegram 406 of 4th June. [1] I entirely agree that a private undertaking communicated without publicity to Japanese Government is adequate. I expressed that view in London. I will ask Bruce [2] to advise the Foreign Office in that sense.
