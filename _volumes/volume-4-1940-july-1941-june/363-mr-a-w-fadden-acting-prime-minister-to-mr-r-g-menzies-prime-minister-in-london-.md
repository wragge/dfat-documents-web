# 363 Mr A. W. Fadden, Acting Prime Minister, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister (in London)

Cablegram 162 26 March 1941,

SECRET

War Cabinet today gave consideration to Circular Z.66 of the 11th March from Dominions Office [1] which, in view of the present situation, has given us some cause for optimism as to the possibility of a joint declaration on the lines indicated therein.

A message has been despatched to the Dominions Office [2] indicating that the Government is naturally anxious that the joint declaration might be made. We realise that every possible effort is being made to secure action on the lines indicated in paragraph 3 of Z.66 but would welcome an appreciation from you on this question.

FADDEN
