# 13 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Cablegram unnumbered 5 July 1940,

MOST SECRET

On further reading proposed reply to Japan [1] and latest news 

regarding increased power of militant party in Japan we are 

impressed by view that if Great Britain not in fact sending 

materials of war along Burmese Road there should be no difficulty 

about undertaking [? not] to do so. Press cables to Australia 

suggesting that Great Britain insisting upon the right to supply 

war material to China are doing harm to public opinion which feels 

that such materials are badly needed by British countries. Suggest 

therefore that agreement regarding prevention of passage of such 

material can properly be made. This applies Hong Kong Frontier as 

well as Burma. [2]

United States, and to Peter Fraser, N.Z. Prime Minister.

Bruce replied on 6 July: 'United Kingdom supplies passing over 

Burma road negligible. Supplies affected would be mainly American.
