# 9 Maj Gen H. L. Ismay, Chief of Staff to U.K. Minister of Defence, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

Letter [LONDON], 4 July 1940

SECRET

Since our talk yesterday morning, I have now had a look at the 

telegram about which we spoke [1], and have discussed the matter 

with my Staff. They point out that our inability to send a Fleet 

to the Far East in the changed circumstances was emphasised in a 

telegram to the Dominions, which was drafted by the Chiefs of 

Staff as long ago as the 13th June (see Telegram No. Circular Z 

No. 106, paragraph 9). [2]

It is, of course, perfectly true that, before the war, it had 

always been our intention to despatch a Fleet to the Far East in 

the event of serious trouble with Japan. It was said on various 

occasions that if it came to a choice of jeopardising either our 

Middle East and Mediterranean interests, or the security of the 

Empire in the Far East, we should not hesitate to sacrifice the 

former. I do not think anything has occurred to alter our point of 

view on this.

At present, however, it is not this choice which confronts us. 

Owing to the complete collapse of the French and the elimination 

of their fleet, there would be nothing now to prevent the Italian 

fleet from leaving the Mediterranean and entering the struggle in 

the Atlantic and home waters, basing itself on French ports. The 

despatch of a Fleet to the Far East, which would involve the 

removal of our capital ships from the Mediterranean, would 

therefore not only seriously jeopardise our position in the Middle 

East, but would endanger the safety of this country and its vital 

communications. This being so, it is clearly necessary for us to 

make certain of defeating the immediate danger in home waters, 

which is for the moment the decisive point, by concentrating our 

forces in this area.

This situation, which we hope will be of short duration, does not 

invalidate what was said in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum (Paper 

No. D.M.V.(39)4) [3], which the present Prime Minister [4] 

circulated to Dominion Ministers last November.

The important passage reads as follows:-

'However, should Japanese encroachment begin, or should Great 

Britain pass into a state of war with Japan, the Admiralty would 

make such preparatory dispositions as would enable them to offer 

timely resistance either to the serious attack upon Singapore or 

to the invasion of Australia and New Zealand. These dispositions 

would not necessarily take the form of stationing a fleet at 

Singapore, but would be of a character to enable the necessary 

concentrations to be made to the eastward in ample time to prevent 

a disaster.'

The arguments which the Chiefs of Staff would put forward may be 

summarily stated as follows: Japan cannot undertake a serious 

invasion of Australia so long as:-

(a) The British Fleet (wherever it may be) is in being: and

(b) Singapore is secure.

The first condition still holds good, and it is to ensure the 

second condition that the Chiefs of Staff have asked Australia to 

send a Division and two Squadrons of aircraft to Malaya.

We could very easily arrange for you to have a discussion with the 

Chiefs of Staff on the whole question, if you so desired. In that 

event, I feel sure that the discussion would be far more 

profitable if you were to let us have a short note on the 

particular points which you wished considered.

Alternatively, since the problem is almost exclusively a Naval 

one, I wonder if you would not get better value out of a talk with 

the First Sea Lord. [5] If you will let me know what you would 

like, I will arrange it for you.

I ought to add that the telegram on the position in the Middle 

East, which you mentioned in our talk this morning, was completed 

by the Chiefs of Staff last night, and has today, I think, been 

despatched to the Dominions. [6]
