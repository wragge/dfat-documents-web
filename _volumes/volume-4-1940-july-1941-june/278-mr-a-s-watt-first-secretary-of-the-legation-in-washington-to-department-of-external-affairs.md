1 Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin.

2 Commander H. M. Burrell. It appears that copies of this and the following cablegram from Burrell (Document 279) were not shown to the Acting Prime Minister, A. W. Fadden, until he asked to see them on 13 February. In a teleprinter message to the Minister for External Affairs, Sir Frederick Stewart, on 13 February the Secretary of the External Affairs Dept, Lt Col W. R. Hodgson, explained that these cablegrams had been sent by Burrell 'direct to his Chief only. In such cases as these operational and strategical messages, we regard ourselves as channel of communication only, the responsibility for showing them to the Minister or the Acting Prime Minister being the Chief of Naval Staff's'. See file AA:A1608, Y27/1/1. Subsequent progress reports on the conversations (Documents 294, 316, 318, 365 and 380) were teleprinted to Fadden on receipt.

3 Document 267.
