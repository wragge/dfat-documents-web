# 430 Sir John Latham, Minister to Japan, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 197 TOKYO, 25 April 1941, 12.15 p.m.

SECRET

Your telegram No. 123. [1]

As now advised I am generally in accord with the views contained in your telegram No. 112. I agree strongly that we should avoid mere polemics and pinpricks. I understand suggested measures are intended to be imposed as reprisals should Japan make some definite further move hostile to us and not to be imposed prior to any such move so that the question of action does not arise at the present moment. I share your doubt whether they would be effective and not merely provocative. However I am at present in consultation with the British Ambassador [2] and Canadian Charge d'Affaires [3] with a view to putting forward proposals regarding (a) present economic policy (b) reprisals should such be necessary, and will advise fully as soon as possible.
