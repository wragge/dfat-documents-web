# 174 Lt Col W. R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, to Mr B. C. Ballard, Official Representative in New Caledonia

## Cablegram 53 16 October 1940,

Reference your 51. [1] For your information Consul General Japan [2] visited Canberra to state his Government had received authentic information that Commonwealth Government had requested Sautot [3] to place an embargo on all goods exported to Japan. He was informed no such request made. On being pressed as to source of information he stated French officials had told Japanese Consul-General. [4] I replied such inaccurate reports tended to create misunderstandings and we also had information their Consul was interfering with internal affairs of Colony both of which he should report to his Government.

HODGSON
