# 11 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 514 LONDON, 4 July 1940, 9.57 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET PERSONAL FOR HIMSELF

Appreciation of Middle East in Z.168 [1] in my view is mere 

statement of obvious facts within the knowledge of any reasonably 

competent person. It stresses the importance of our position in 

the Middle East and in paragraph 8 shows what that position hinges 

on. In subsequent paragraphs it indicates the possibility of our 

not being able to maintain our position in various vital areas 

referred to in paragraph 2 and in paragraph 9 it states the 

necessity of strengthening our forces in the Middle East but 

indicates little prospect of its being possible to do this for a 

considerable time. It, however, gives no indication of what the 

plan would be in the event of our having to retire from any of the 

vital points mentioned. For example, paragraph 4 shows that we 

have forces in Egypt sufficient only to cope with Italy so long as 

we retain a fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. That Alexandria 

might be rendered untenable as fleet base if Italy reinforced in 

the air by Germany. In the event of these reinforcements being 

provided Alexandria becoming untenable and Egypt having to be 

evacuated no indication is given as to where it is contemplated 

that forces now in Egypt would be withdrawn.

This is only one example but there are many others that will occur 

to you.

The present arrangement is that I am to discuss this appreciation 

as well as the Far Eastern questions raised in Dominions Office 

telegram No. 228 [2] with Chiefs of Staff Committee.

Please send me any specific points you would desire me to raise in 

this discussion.

BRUCE
