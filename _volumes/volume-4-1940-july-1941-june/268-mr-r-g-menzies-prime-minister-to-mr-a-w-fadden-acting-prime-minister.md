# 268 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr A. W. Fadden, Acting Prime Minister

Cablegram BA53 GAZA, 4 February 1941, 10.47 a.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

For personal information of Acting Prime Minister- Reference your cablegram relative staff conversations Netherlands East Indies [1], it is noted that proposals are not in line with suggestions made in my cablegram from Singapore. [2]

The latter course appeared essential to dispose of this matter quickly and thoroughly. It would also warrant the appointment of senior representatives such as Deputy Chiefs of Staff except that more junior naval officer would do if Colvin [3] at Singapore at the same time.
