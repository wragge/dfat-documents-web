# 6 Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 239 LONDON, 3 July 1940, 11.50 a.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

[On 30 June 1940 the U.K. Govt informed the Commonwealth Govt in 

cablegram D299 that it proposed to issue a declaration that it 

could not allow Syria or Lebanon to be occupied or used as a haven 

by any hostile power and that it held itself free to take any 

measures necessary in its own interest. On 1 July the Commonwealth 

Govt dispatched cablegram 338 which read in part: 'Have you 

considered possibility of French troops becoming actively hostile 

to us with consequent military repercussions of a serious kind to 

our numerically inferior forces in that zone? Is it impossible to 

get joint declaration with Turkey to defend Syria?' Both 

cablegrams are on file AA: A981, War 45, iv.]

Before receipt of your telegram No. 338 of 1st July His Majesty's 

Ambassador at Angora [1] had indicated that the Turkish Government 

concurred in the draft of the declaration by the United Kingdom 

Government and the declaration was thereupon issued at once.

Careful consideration had been given to the possible attitude of 

the French troops in Syria. It is not expected in the present 

circumstances they will become actively hostile to us. As regards 

the suggestion in the last sentence of your telegram, although 

Turkish co-operation in the defence of Syria and Lebanon might in 

certain circumstances be welcome to us, the Arabs will inevitably 

always be suspicious of the entry of Turkish forces into those 

territories whatever the purpose. Turkey too would probably 

require a reward for lending assistance. It was felt to be most 

important therefore that nothing should be said now or later which 

would give the slightest handle to propaganda that we had sought 

to secure Turkish support for ourselves at the Arabs' expense. In 

the circumstances it was thought to be better not to make an 

approach to Turkey of the kind suggested in your telegram.
