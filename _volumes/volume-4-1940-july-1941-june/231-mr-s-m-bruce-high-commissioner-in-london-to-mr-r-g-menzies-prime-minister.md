# 231 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister

Cablegram 1098 LONDON, 18 December 1940, 4 p.m.

IMMEDIATE FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL

Your cablegram No. 1701. [1] Have seen Prime Minister [2] and showed him your cable with omission of sentence re list of matters. He asked me to tell you how greatly your visit will be welcomed and how much he personally would appreciate your presence here. He also asked me to assure you every facility will be afforded for your journey from Egypt. Reason for omission referred to above was visit would be consultation between Governments with regard to war policy in widest sense. If you advise me of any specific points which would require preparation before your arrival I will insure necessary action being taken.

BRUCE
