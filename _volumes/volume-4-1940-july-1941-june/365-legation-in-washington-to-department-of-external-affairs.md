With reference to my telegram No. 199. [3] Seventh Progress Report.

(1) Final report envisages exchange of Military Missions with the United States when the United States enter the war to collaborate continuously in the formulation of the plan governing the conduct of the war and to ensure co-ordination of administrative action and command [between the] [4] military services.

(2) Report proposes that the Dominions be represented on the British Military Mission in Washington by their Service Attaches.

(3) Until the United States enter the war it is intended to set up a nucleus organisation of Military Missions in London and Washington in order that broad policies and plans that have been agreed to may be considered in detail and that the change over from peace to war be effected rapidly and smoothly.
