(2) Joint declaration by Great Britain and United States: to declare that (a) and (b) above constitute their common position, that a free and independent China is a sine qua non not only for peace in Far East but also for establishing normal and orderly relationships in the whole Pacific and that therefore they (Great Britain and United States) will do their utmost to help China maintain her sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity and to restore peaceful relations among the nations in the Far East.

(3) China and Great Britain to conclude a treaty of alliance and to invite adherence of United States; in the absence of such adherence to secure full approval and support of this alliance by the United States.

(4) Concrete measures for mutual assistance (to be agreed upon before issuance of declarations).

(b) United States to loan China each year from 500 to 1,000 fighting planes and to deliver to China from 200 to 300 such planes before end of this year.

(c) Governments of Great Britain and United States to send to China military, economic and communications missions to devise cooperative measures concerning Far East in conjunction with Chinese Government. Members of such delegations may be appointed by Chinese Government as advisers.
