# 242 Commonwealth Government to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 677 30 December 1940,

SECRET

Your telegram 502. [1] Anglo-Italian Treaty. We appreciate your reasoning and in view of your statement that treaties of this character are ipso facto nullified by outbreak of war and the fact that this attitude would be taken at peace settlement we are prepared to dispense with separate action suggested.

This treaty has received much publicity and many representations have been made to Commonwealth Government to secure abrogation. In circumstances we propose to issue a short statement to press stating that treaty is nullified by outbreak of war. [2]
