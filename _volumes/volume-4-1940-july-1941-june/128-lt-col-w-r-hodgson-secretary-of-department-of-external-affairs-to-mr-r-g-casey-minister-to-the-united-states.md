# 128 Lt Col W. R. Hodgson, Secretary of Department of External Affairs, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

Cablegram 177 20 September 1940,

PERSONAL FOR CASEY MOST SECRET

Your conversations with Secretary of State [1] seem to us to be accomplishing one of their objectives of keeping Japanese guessing. I have had two visits from Consul General Japan [2] during last week especially for purpose of endeavouring to ascertain extent and nature of conversations.

He emphasises they are most disturbing and appear directed against Japan. Naturally I have been completely non-committal, and it is obvious his mind is most perturbed.

HODGSON
