Cablegram 1701 17 December 1940,

PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET

It seems to me desirable that I should accept outstanding invitation to visit London to discuss matters of mutual war importance. Commonwealth Parliament has gone into recess until March and I could leave towards middle of January. Could you confirm that this agreeable to United Kingdom Government. Would of course cable list of matters to be discussed.

I would like to fly to Egypt to make contact with Australian forces there and go thence to Great Britain by the quickest route.

Would be glad of advice as to what arrangements could be made for quick transit Egypt to Great Britain for self and party of say three others.

It would give satisfaction in Australia if a personal consultation of this kind could conveniently take place.

MENZIES
