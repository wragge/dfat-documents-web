# 421 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Mr A. W. Fadden, Acting Prime Minister

Cablegram M76 LONDON, 22 April 1941, 8.39 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Your cable 244. [1] Quite agree that should call Parliament together. Important however to wait a few days for the Greek and Tobruk position to clarify. Churchill does not intend to make full statement or have full dress debate at present. How can there be any effective criticism of the handling of the campaign in the Middle East without securing and disclosing information of value to the enemy? Nothing they can say at Canberra will be more to the point than what I have been saying here, but our present duty is salvage and not recrimination.

Know you will handle this matter in your usual sensible way. You may imagine how I feel but cannot make war without losses and the only means of victory is killing the Germans which our people are doing very notably.

Regards.

MENZIES
