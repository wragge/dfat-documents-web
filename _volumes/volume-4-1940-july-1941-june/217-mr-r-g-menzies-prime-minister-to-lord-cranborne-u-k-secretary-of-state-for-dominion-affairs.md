# 217 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 634 6 December 1940,

MOST SECRET

His Majesty's Government in Commonwealth of Australia have been informed [1] that attempts are being made at instigation of Axis Powers to resume illicit entry of Jewish immigrants into Palestine.

In view of the vital importance of the Middle East and the concentration of Australian troops in that region, the Commonwealth Government view with grave concern the danger of arousing the Arab world against us and prejudicing the military position in that theatre. We strongly urge adherence to the policy of May, 1939 [2], which set a definite limit to further Jewish immigration except with Arab consent, and recall from your circular cablegram 2nd March [3] that it was stated United Kingdom have no intention of permitting Jewish immigrants into Palestine in excess of the number laid down in the White Paper.
