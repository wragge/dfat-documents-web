Cablegram 2904 10 June 1941,

Please see my telegram No. 355 to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs-We have replied agreeing to conference and nominating you as representative. [1] Our view is that any public declaration or resolutions emanating from conference should not go beyond the general principles indicated in D.581 of 23rd November [2], and that conference should not be designated or constitute itself as Supreme War Council, as was suggested at one stage of consultation.
