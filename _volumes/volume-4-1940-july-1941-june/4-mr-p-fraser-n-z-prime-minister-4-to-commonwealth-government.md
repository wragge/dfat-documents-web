# 4 Mr P. Fraser, N.Z. Prime Minister, 4 to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram unnumbered WELLINGTON, 3 July 1940, 3.30 a.m.

MOST SECRET

I thank you for your telegram of 28th June with reference to the 

Far Eastern situation. [1] We entirely agree with you on the 

following points-

(a) The delicacy and danger of the situation.

(b) The desirability of obtaining a clear indication of the United 

States policy in the Far East.

(c) The desirability, if circumstances allow, of retaining the 

United States fleet in the Pacific.

(d) The extreme undesirability of any act or omission on our part 

which might have the effect of unnecessarily precipitating trouble 

with Japan in our present situation.

(e) The undesirability of any attempt to haggle with Japan.

(f) The undesirability in the best interests of the British 

Commonwealth of involvement of United States in a war in the Far 

East.

(g) The probable futility of the suggestion that in the present 

circumstances Japan might be induced on the lines proposed to 

offer the restoration of territorial integrity and independence of 

China.

On the other hand we are most sceptical as to whether Japan would 

in the existing situation be persuaded to make a satisfactory 

tripartite declaration as to status quo in the Pacific or whether 

such a declaration if made would have any value at all unless 

accompanied by a full United States guarantee, which would seem 

unlikely at the moment.

Again we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the offer of 

mediation that you propose, in the absence of United States 

collaboration, offers any substantial promise of successful 

results. Nor are we convinced that a simple acceptance of the 

present Japanese demands would be morally right or even 

politically expedient. Indeed we are inclined to feel that an 

acceptance of the Japanese demands or an offer of mediation 

between Japan and China might well be interpreted by the Japanese 

as a plain indication of the weakness of our position and of our 

readiness on that account to sacrifice the Chinese and the 

principle of resisting aggression for the purpose of endeavouring 

to protect our own interests. We are at present inclined to feel 

that an appearance of continued confidence is more likely to be 

effective with the Japanese than any step which might be 

interpreted as a display of weakness. On the whole, however, we 

are inclined to defer formation of any definite judgment on this 

most difficult problem until it has been possible to ascertain the 

result of the approach which has already been made by His 

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to the United States 

Government.

A copy of this telegram has today been despatched to the Secretary 

of State for Dominion Affairs. [2]
