# 172 Lord Cranborne, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, U.K. High Commissioner in Australia

Circular cablegram Z303 LONDON, 12 October 1940, 7.59 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

My telegram of 10th October Circular Z.298. [1] Since my telegram of 9th October No. 334 [2] His Majesty's Ambassador at Washington [3] has reported that the United States Secretary of State [4] now feels it necessary to proceed with great caution in view of shock to United States public opinion of realisation of the possible consequences of deterioration of relations with Japan, and that he is therefore for the present opposed to United States participation in the Singapore Conference and in suggested conferences in London and Washington. Mr. Hull nevertheless appears to contemplate private conversations in London between service representatives for exchange of information and for discussion of the problems as to common defence.

We are considering the position urgently and will telegraph to you further as soon as possible.
