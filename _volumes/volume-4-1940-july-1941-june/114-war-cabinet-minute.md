# 114 War Cabinet Minute

## Minute 498 SYDNEY, 10 September 1940

NEW CALEDONIA

(Previous reference-War Cabinet Minute No. (418) [1]).

(The Chief of the Naval Staff [2] was present for the discussion of this subject).

The Minister for External Affairs [3] brought to the notice of War Cabinet cablegram No. 182 of 9th September from the British Resident Commissioner, New Hebrides [4], regarding the plans of M.

Sautot [5] for his 'coup de force' at Noumea. Reference was also made to the comments of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific [6] in his cablegram No. 273 of 10th September to the British Resident Commissioner on the latter's cablegram.

It was decided that the Commanding Officer of H.M.A.S. 'Adelaide' [7] is to be informed that it is to be clearly understood that the responsibility for proceeding to Noumea is a matter for M. Sautot himself, and the Commanding Officer is not to convey him there against his wishes.
