# 414 Mr A. W. Fadden, Acting Prime Minister, to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister (in London)

Cablegram 238 20 April 1941,

MOST SECRET

With reference your M.38 of 1st April [1] please see my 239 of even date to Dominions Office. [2] Latham [3] has advised of report that 10 divisions concentrated in Formosa and 3 in Hainan and transports for whole force in readiness for attack on Singapore to synchronize with German bombing attack on Suez Canal.

Casey [4] also refers similar reports received in Washington. If joint declaration at present time could be arranged would therefore be most opportune.

FADDEN
