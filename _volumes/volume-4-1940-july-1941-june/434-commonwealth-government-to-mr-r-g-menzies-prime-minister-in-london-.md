# 434 Commonwealth Government to Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister (in London)

## Cablegram unnumbered 27 April 1941,

IMMEDIATE

In a press statement issued today, Mr. Curtin, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the A.L.P., emphasised that there was no political disunity in Australia about the prosecution of the war.

On the contrary, Australians face it as a united and determined people: although criticism and expression of opinion are free here this should not be mistaken as any evidence of doubt.

It was reprehensible that political controversy had been capitalised by the enemy to the detriment of our cause. 'There never has been nor should there be,' said Mr. Curtin, 'any doubt about Australia. As Leader of the A.L.P., I say to our enemies that the workers of this country are determined to give their all in the war that has been forced upon us. To the United States I say that the Labour Movement of Australia will be unflinching and unyielding to the end for we have a common interest and a common fate in resisting any aggression. Finally, I say to all the world, friends or foes, there is no political disunity in Australia in regard to the prosecution of the war.' [1]
