# 1 Mr R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister, to Lord Caldecote, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 339 1 July 1940,

MOST SECRET

In furtherance of the declared policy of fostering and developing 

friendly relations in countries on the Pacific, Australia has 

established a legation at Washington, and as you are aware has 

taken the formal steps to establish one immediately at Tokyo.

We have ample evidence that Japan was disappointed that the Tokyo 

and Washington Legations were not established simultaneously.

For some time the Consul-General for China [1], acting on definite 

instructions from his Government, has been pressing for the 

establishment of a legation in China simultaneously with that in 

Japan. He has renewed representations during the past week. [2]

We have given consideration to this question in our review of the 

general Far Eastern and Pacific situation this week.

From the aspect of post war economic and political conditions, on 

the assumption that a substantial portion of China will remain 

under the control of the National Government and by virtue of our 

adherence to the League resolution to do nothing to weaken the 

position of China in the face of Japanese aggression, a case can 

be made out for the establishment of such a legation.

On the other hand, we feel that such a step may be resented by 

Japan, and would nullify the favourable effect of the decision in 

regard to Tokyo.

It has already been suggested by Japan that Australia should 

recognise the new order in Eastern Asia, as specifically referring 

to the Wang Ching Wei Government. [3]

The position in the Far East is so unstable at the moment that it 

is not inconceivable that the United Kingdom Government itself may 

have to consider the advisability of recognising the latter 

Government.

We do not wish to take any action which may irritate Japan while 

at the same time we have a friendly feeling in relation to China.

Before arriving at a definite conclusion, I would be glad to have 

the views of the United Kingdom Government on the question.
