# 23 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr R. G. Casey, Minister to the United States

## Cablegram 35 LONDON, 10 July 1940, 9.20 p.m.

I have suggested Lothian [1] should be instructed to sound out whether the United States by a calculated indiscretion or some other method would let it be known that in the event of the Burmese road being dosed as a result of Japan's demands the United States would be compelled seriously to consider whether it could continue to allow supplies to go to Japan when it was being prevented from sending supplies to other belligerents. Such action might have a steadying effect.

1 U. K. Ambassador to the United States.
