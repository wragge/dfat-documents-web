# 10 Sir Robert Craigie, U.K. Ambassador to Japan, to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram unnumbered TOKYO, 4 July 1940, 8 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Following from Hard [1]

I was present at an Embassy Conference at which information was 

given that the Young Army group are getting out of hand and will 

precipitate direct action on the least pretext. Decided change was 

thought to be imminent on Manchukuo Emperor's [2] departure over 

the week-end, new Cabinet probably containing Shiratori as Foreign 

Minister and involving extreme likelihood of Axis link up and 

giving the militant party an impetus to carry on pre-arranged 

plan. If an unfavourable proposal is submitted regarding the 

Burmese Road, direct action will result, particularly in view of 

the publicity given to the American announcement of inability to 

prevent Japanese aggression in the Pacific. The Ambassador 

suggests that I submit that Australia's influence on home [i.e. 

U.K.] Government would be appreciated to enable conciliation 

measures for the removal of this pretext for aggression. Though 

unwilling to commit herself on behalf of the general British 

interests is there any likelihood of America rendering assistance 

to Australia.
