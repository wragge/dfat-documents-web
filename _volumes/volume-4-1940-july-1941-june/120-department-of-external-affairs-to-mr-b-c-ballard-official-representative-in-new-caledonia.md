# 120 Department of External Affairs to Mr B. C. Ballard, Official Representative in New Caledonia

Cablegram 21 16 September 1940,

SECRET

Understand Admiralty Reporting Officer Noumea [1] is informing you of plan Sautot's arrival Thursday.

Meanwhile we have been asked by United Kingdom Government for views on economic and financial assistance desirable to New Caledonia after Sautot has been installed [2] in accordance with undertaking given de Gaulle [3] in letter from Churchill 27th August last. This promise was to effect that United Kingdom Government would do everything in its power to maintain economic stability of all French overseas territories provided they stood by the Alliance and that United Kingdom Government was ready to foster trade and help the administration of those parts of the French Empire now cut off from France. Subject to needs of British war effort, United Kingdom Government would be prepared to extend economic assistance on a scale similar to that which it would apply in comparable circumstances to colonies of British Empire.

Glad to have your observations as soon as possible on what further measures in this connection might be required for New Caledonia.
