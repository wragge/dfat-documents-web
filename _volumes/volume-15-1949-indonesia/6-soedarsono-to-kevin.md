# 6 Soedarsono to Kevin

## Letter NEW DELHI, 3 January 1949

In connection with our discussion yesterday [1] on steps which might be taken by several countries, jointly or individually, for the purpose of 'forcing' the Dutch to come to an immediate and just solution of the Dutch-Indonesian issue, I should like to call your attention to the following.

Among measures on the economic field-besides the closing of aerodromes for Dutch aeroplanes-the refusal of harbour facilities to Dutch ships means a considerable pressure on the Dutch. In case of difficulties in closing the harbours, in connection with international agreements, regulations as to the same effect can be issued.

The Dutch, for instance, with the naval blockade around the Republican territories, have for the same purpose declared several materials as contraband with a very broad interpretation thereof.

It extends to material of an entirely non-military nature and practically comes to allowing only foodstuff and a special kind of textiles to pass their blockade.

Furthermore, in exercising the control, the Dutch examined the ships, demanded not only the showing of manifests of lading, but more thoroughly by forcing the ship's master to discharge the whole cargo and to reload it again after examination.

Following are notations with regard to Dutch conception of contraband:

1\. It is generally proclaimed by the Dutch that their control on imports to and exports from Republican territories is only conducted with a view to check the imports of arms and ammunition to Republican territories, and the export of estate produce from Sumatra and Java.

2\. In reality not only the import of military goods, but the import of material for re-habilitation purposes as well is prohibited. Military goods consist a.o. of under following items:

Arms ammunition of every kind and size, military vehicles as trucks, jeeps, motor cycles, bicycles, spares, accessories and even civilian vehicles, khaki uniforms and cloth, military and ordinary boots, equipments for hospitals as beds, stretchers, surgical instruments, (medicaments and instruments can only be sent with the intermediacy of the International Red Cross). The rehabilitation goods consist a.o. of under following items:

a. motor cars, tractors, steamrollers, spares and accessories.

b. machines, spares, accessories for existing factories, mills and printing enterprises, asphalt, solar oil.

c. building material as corrugated roofs, cement, nails, wires, electrical equipment etc. (very recently an insignificant quota of such material is allowed through joint pressure of Singapore's Economic Affairs Department, traders, and our Indonesia Office in Singapore).

d. Printing material is very restrictedly allowed.

3\. In praxis [sic] the import of food stuff and textiles and luxury goods alone is free.

I have sent the above to Mr. Usman Sastroamidjojo, with the request to submit it, after approval, to your Government.
