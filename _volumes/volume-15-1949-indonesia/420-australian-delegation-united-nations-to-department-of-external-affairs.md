# 420 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN332 NEW YORK, 24 May 1949, 3.59 p.m.

RESTRICTED

1\. We would appreciate reports on how matters are developing in Indonesia, and your views on the desirability of an early meeting of the Council to discuss the recent negotiations and their outcome. Time for such a meeting would probably be after the return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta and the fixing of the date for The Hague Conference, but any delays might make earlier meeting desirable.

2\. Palar informs us that he has been getting instructions from Sumatra emergency Republican Government, and that he has seen pronouncements of this Government disclaiming statements of Roem in negotiations. If true this would be a bad omen for future.
