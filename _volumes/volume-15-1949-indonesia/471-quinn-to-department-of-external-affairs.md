In connection with the persistent press reports giving August 22nd as the opening date of the R.T.C., A.N.P. has reported authoritative statement 'that the opening date cannot be fixed unilaterally by the Dutch; it would have to be decided in consultation with the Republican and Federalist delegations and with U.N.C.I. Discussions to this end would begin as soon as possible.'
