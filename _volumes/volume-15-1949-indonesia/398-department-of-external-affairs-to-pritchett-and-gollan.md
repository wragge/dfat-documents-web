# 398 Department of External Affairs to Pritchett and Gollan

Cablegram 85, 186 CANBERRA, 12 May 1949

RESTRICTED

We have received detailed list of goods required by the Republican ministries and the Republican Government in connection with establishment at Djokjakarta. Please ascertain and advise immediately to what extent can Dutch assistance be expected in the supply of office equipment, transport, radio and telephonic equipment all of which will be vital to the successful administration of the Republican Government. If in view of the Commission it is unlikely that adequate Dutch equipment will be available does the Commission propose reporting that fact to Security Council and/or appealing to interested nations for necessary assistance?
