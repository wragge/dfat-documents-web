Cablegram K336 BATAVIA, 10 August 1949, 11.10 a.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

Your telegram 124. [1]

1\. s'Jacob, leader of the Netherlands Delegation, assures me that there is no question of the Netherlands insisting upon a completely effective cease-hostilities before the beginning of The Hague talks.

2\. You will by now have received the Commission's first interim report [2] which should provide a basis for the Security Council discussion. However, Palar, before leaving for Lake Success, on August 9th, said that the Republic would not ask for any debate if The Hague Conference was going smoothly and would discourage any move for debate from the Asiatic Bloc.

3\. The Central Joint Board held its first formal meeting August 9th and agreed on the immediate establishment of the thirteen local Joint Committees, nine in Java and four in Sumatra. The Board will meet again on Saturday at Djokjakarta to decide on the lines of procedure for the delineation of the zones of patrol.

4\. It will not be possible to report on the implementation of the cease-hostilities for at least three weeks.
