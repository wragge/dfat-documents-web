# 170 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN69 NEW YORK, 28 January 1949

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Indonesia 1. Resolution [1] as amended by sponsoring powers and by Canada (who proposed provision limiting observation by United Nations of elections to Java, Sumatra and Madura) was passed by Council this evening. France abstained throughout and Argentine on all provisions relating to the Commission. Soviet and Ukraine supported Third, Fourth and final paragraphs of preamble and paragraph two of resolution. They proposed new paragraph one calling for immediate withdrawal which was rejected by 4-0-7. Only speech of importance before vote was long statement by Dutch.

Their particular objections are to paragraphs 2, 3, 4A and 4F on the grounds mainly of domestic jurisdiction. Whole tone of speech was hostile and concluded with observation to the effect that resolution would be accepted only to the extent that it did not conflict with Dutch responsibilities.
