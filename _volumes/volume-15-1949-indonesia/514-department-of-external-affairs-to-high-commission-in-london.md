# 514 Department of External Affairs to High Commission in London

Cablegram 4575 CANBERRA, 21 October 1949

RESTRICTED

Your 4370. [1]

Minister has discussed this question with Netherlands Minister [2] and previously considered it when raised at Round Table Conference.

Dutch New Guinea has never been regarded by us as forming part of Indonesia as demonstrated by inclusion of Dutch New Guinea in area of South Pacific Commission.

Dutch trusteeship has always, in our view, been best solution. Any attempt to force the issue along lines United Kingdom propose 'for the present' might easily result in territory going completely outside any form of Dutch control.

For your information, before receipt of your 4370 Minister had already conveyed these views informally to Netherlands Minister.

Please pass confidentially to The Hague.

1 Dispatched on 20 October, it reported that the Netherlands Ambassador in London had suggested to the UK Government that West New Guinea be placed under a Netherlands trusteeship but that the UK Government had indicated that it preferred not to change the status quo.

2 P.E. Teppema.
