# 323 High Commission in New Delhi to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 227 NEW DELHI, 28 March 1949, 7.40 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

My immediately preceding telegram. [1] Paraphrase begins:-

'We have been approached by the Government of Australia to join them in an endeavour to place the Indonesian question on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Please refer to part C of Resolution number 1 [2] of the New Delhi Conference. We have made the following suggestions to the Australian Government.

(a) That Dr. Evatt as President of the Assembly should approach the President of the Security Council to agree to presentation by the Council of a report on the Indonesian situation and (b) that the Australian Government should instruct their representative [3] in New York to join our representative [4] in urging on the representatives of the Governments which participated in the New Delhi Conference the importance of a concerted effort to have the Indonesian question included in the agenda.

Please get in touch with Hood and do whatever you can to achieve the result described in (b) above. We are also instructing our delegation to the General Assembly to work for the inclusion of the Indonesian question on the agenda of the General Assembly.' Ends.
