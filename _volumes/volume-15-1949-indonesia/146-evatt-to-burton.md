# 146 Evatt to Burton

## Cablegram 43 CANBERRA, 23 January 1949, 1.20 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE

It is completely mysterious that my en clair telegram [1] was not received by you. It was carefully drafted and there should have been plenty of time for you to act on it. All voting by you must be ad referendum as instructed. Acknowledge this and my 40 [2] most immediately.
