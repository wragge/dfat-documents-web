# 162 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN61 NEW YORK, 26 January 1949, 7.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

1\. United States have been seeing other sponsors of joint resolution [1] throughout to-day and have agreed on certain minor modifications to bring draft closer to New Delhi resolution. [2] United States delegation frankly admits that the changes are not significant but they are as far as other delegations would go, especially the United Kingdom who appear to be the real stumbling block to any real changes. However United States will not be averse to further changes if they can be made without endangering the whole resolution.

2\. It has been impossible to discover here what the precise area of the residency of Djokjakarta is so the provision has been widened to include 'The immediate environs' of the city.

3\. In 4(f) additional words have been inserted which make the relevant part read 'such economic measures as are required for the proper functioning of the administration and for the economic well being, etc.' 4. Despite some efforts no progress has been made on clarifying withdrawal proposals.

5\. A quite meaningless concession has been made to the Dutch by the insertion of the words 'and invite' in the section on the participation of the Federalists. This in no way alters the sense of the passage but may help the Dutch.
