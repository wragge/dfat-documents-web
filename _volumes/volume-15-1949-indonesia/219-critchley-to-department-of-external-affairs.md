# 219 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K269 BATAVIA, 15 February 1949, 4.15 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

My telegram No. K. 268. [1]

Cochran believes that his recent intensive discussions [2] at The Hague are producing results and offer the only opportunity for the implementation of the 28th January resolution. [3] He is emphatically opposed to reporting Dutch non-compliance at this stage, and will not go beyond suggesting to the Security Council that the detailed report be delayed until 1st March.

Please advise today whether I can accept the postponement or should submit a minority report against the strongly expressed wishes of the Americans.
