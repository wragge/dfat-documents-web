# 76 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 19 CANBERRA, 13 January 1949, 5.10 p.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

Your UN. 8. [1]

You should continue to press for inclusion in any draft resolution of an instruction to the Dutch to withdraw their armed forces to December 17th positions. We sense that United States as well as United Kingdom is now lukewarm on the question of ordering withdrawal to demarcation lines. It is, however, idle to talk in terms of free elections in areas which, in absence of Dutch withdrawal, would be under forcible occupation of Dutch troops.

Even supposing such elections were to be supervised by United Nations free expression of opinion could not be expected.
