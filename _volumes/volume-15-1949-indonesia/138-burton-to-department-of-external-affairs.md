This Conference of representatives of Governments of Afghanistan etc., affirms their support of purposes and principles of United Nations and obligations of all member states to accept its decision; having considered the situation in Indonesia in the light of all available data and in particular the reports submitted by G.O.C. of the Security Council; finding that the Dutch military action launched December 18th, 1948, constitutes a flagrant breach of the Charter of the United Nations and a violation of the efforts of the Security Council and its G.O.C. to bring about a peaceful settlement; noting that the Netherlands authorities have failed to give full effect to the resolution [2] of the Security Council adopted after that date; finding further that this action is directed against the very existence of the Republican Government which the Security Council, several member Governments of the United Nations including the Netherlands Government itself have recognised; conscious of the danger to the peace of South East Asia and of the world through the continuance of hostilities in Indonesia, sympathise in full with aspirations of the Indonesian people to attain their independence; recognise preservation of peace and promotion of democratic freedom constituting high and steadfast purpose of United Nations; firmly convinced Security Council is rightfully seized of situation under art 39 [3] of the United Nations Charter; recommends to Security Council, United Nations:

In order that the formation of a United States of Indonesia should be in conformity with the will of the Indonesian people the G.O.C. shall not permit the formation of any new regional Government.

(4). That such Interim Government should enjoy full powers of internal Government including control over its armed forces. To ensure this all the Dutch troops should be withdrawn from the whole of Indonesia on a date to be determined by the G.O.C. or other body appointed by the Security Council.

The member States of U.N. represented at this Conference pledge their full support to the Council in the application of these measures.
