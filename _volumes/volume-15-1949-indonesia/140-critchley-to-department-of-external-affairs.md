# 140 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K254 BATAVIA, 21 January 1949, 6.20 p.m.

SECRET

The Committee yesterday, January 20th, requested permission to visit Soekarno, Salim at Prapat. The Netherlands delegation asked the Committee to delay its visit since arrangements had already been made for Federalist Indonesians to proceed to Prapat today.

The latter will invite Soekarno to go with them to Bangka to see Hatta. The Netherlands delegation suggested that both Soekarno and Hatta might then return with the Federalists to Batavia.

2\. Members of the Republic Delegation in Batavia were concerned that the Federalists might see Soekarno before he was fully acquainted with the situation. They, therefore, renewed their request to visit leaders as soon as possible. The Netherlands granted this request and suggested that the Republicans should travel in the same aircraft with the Federalists. The Republicans have accepted but have written to the Committee stressing that their journey is in no way connected with the mission of the Federalists who are visiting the Republic Leaders on their own initiative.

3\. Drees's mission having failed the Dutch are anxious to seek a [rapproche]ment [1] with the Republic leaders through the Federalists. It is most unlikely however, that Soekarno and Hatta will accept an invitation in this form to return to Batavia.

4\. Hatta has requested the Committee's assistance for a meeting with Sjahrir, Leimena and for assistance to obtain the necessary facilities for both these Republicans to proceed to Lake Success.
