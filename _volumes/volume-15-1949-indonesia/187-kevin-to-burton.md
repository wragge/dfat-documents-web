# 187 Kevin to Burton

## Memorandum NEW DELHI, 3 February 1949

ASIAN CONFERENCE

Further to our despatch No. 6/49 [1] of February 3rd and to the cablegrams therein referred to, we desire to report a conversation between the Egyptian Ambassador (Ismail Kamel Bey), the High Commissioner and myself when the Ambassador called on Mr. Gollan today.

2\. The Ambassador paid warm tribute to Dr. Burton's work at the Delhi conference and to what he described as his farsightedness and balance.

3\. The Ambassador was pleased with the results of the conference.

Referring to Bajpai's aide memoire [2], he said that he (Ismail Kamel Bey) envisaged two blocs (sic) both centred on India and both pledged to democratic principles in a way which would stem the advance of Communism. He was most eloquent on this subject. He then went on to say that like India, Indonesia should be a member of both groups since she was spiritually part of Islam. The Ambassador's other arguments in support of a dual role for Indonesia were a little difficult to grasp.
