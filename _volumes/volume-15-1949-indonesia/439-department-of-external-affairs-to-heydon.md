# 439 Department of External Affairs to Heydon

Cablegram 2551 CANBERRA, 17 June 1949, 4.20 p.m.

RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

You should take early opportunity of emphasising to Foreign Office that according to latest reports we have from Batavia there should be no necessity to delay opening of Hague conference beyond July.

The object should be to impress on the Dutch that it would be in their interest to have something positive to show when the next Assembly Session meets. Any tendency to delay a settlement is likely to bring them under strong attack in the Assembly.
