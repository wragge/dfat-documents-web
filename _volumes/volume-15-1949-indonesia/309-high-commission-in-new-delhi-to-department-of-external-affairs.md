# 309 High Commission in New Delhi to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 215 NEW DELHI, 22 March 1949, 4.50 p.m.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL

Your telegram 134. [1] Bajpai agrees with your views but before committing his Government he will see Nehru.

2\. Bajpai would like your advice as to how approach to Assembly should be made. He sees slight difficulty since Security Council is seized with the matter but thinks that one way out might be for Dr. Evatt as President of the Assembly to arrange with the President of the Security Council for the Assembly to discuss it.

He remarked that the Asian Conference resolution [2] envisages discussion by the Assembly.

3\. Bajpai feels that the weight of the countries who attend[ed] the Asian Conference and who are members of the United Nations could be thrown behind the proposal for joint action. He thinks that there might be advantages in holding an informal meeting of these countries in New York for this purpose.

1 Dispatched on 21 March, it conveyed the view of the Department of External Affairs that Australia and India should jointly place the Indonesian question on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, despite the issue being still before the Security Council, so that it could be debated without a recommendation.

2 Document 144.
