# 147 Maramis to Evatt

## Letter NEW DELHI, 23 January 1949

On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Indonesia, I have the honour to thank you profoundly and sincerely for the keen interest taken by your Government in the struggle for the defence of our national independence against the aggression of Dutch imperialism, by sending your Government's Observer to the Conference on Indonesia convened by the Honourable Pandit Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, and held during the days of January 20-22, 1949, in New Delhi.

I am hopeful and confident that the resolution on Indonesia passed at the said Conference, being the result of the unanimous desire of the representatives of the Governments of a great number of countries, representing more than half of the world population, will carry weight in restoring peace and in effecting a final over-all political settlement of the Indonesian question.

I am further taking this opportunity in requesting Your Excellency to convey my thanks, admiration and appreciation for the Observer's efforts in helping to lead the Conference on Indonesia to a satisfactory conclusion.

I hope that as a result of the resolution passed at the Conference, peace and order will soon come back in my country, and so open many more opportunities for friendly relations between our countries to be strengthened.

Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.
