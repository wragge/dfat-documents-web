# 77 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 20 CANBERRA, 14 January 1949, 11 a.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

In course of personal conversation with Critchley in Batavia, Drees has stated that Netherlands Delegation is being authorised to inform the Security Council that the Netherlands might be prepared to establish a date for Indonesian elections and to transfer sovereignty in the near future. Drees did not commit himself on the date for elections but Critchley gathered that they would be held in six to twelve months time.

While this may indicate that the Dutch are beginning to recognise the strength of world opposition to their policy, it should not of course be allowed to mislead the Council into toning down any resolution providing for close supervision by the United Nations of elections and subsequent transfer of sovereignty.

Drees also indicated that the Dutch will endeavour to justify their military action to the Security Council by submitting documents alleging that the Republican Government is responsible for infiltration and terrorism in Netherlands-controlled territories.
