# 385 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K309 BATAVIA, [7 May 1949], 8.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

Parties met this afternoon under the auspices of U.N.C.I. when the Van Royen - Roem statements were agreed upon. The only significant changes to the drafts in K.306 [1] were one of the words 'restoration of peace and in' before 'maintenance of law and order' in paragraph one of the Netherlands statement and the rearrangement of paragraphs three and four of the same statement.

2\. In a subsequent statement Van Royen assured Roem that 'the agreement we have just reached will be carried out [o]n our part with fairness and loyalty and that we shall see to it that no reprisals are taken and that no victimization occurs against anyone belonging to the other party'. Roem replied: 'We too shall implement the agreement in the same spirit. We share Doctor Van Royen's adjudications and shall do our utmost, working in the same direction.' 3. The setting up of a joint committee to prepare for the return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta was held over until Monday when arrangements set out in my telegram K.308 [2] will be carried out.

4\. Agreement on the use of the Maguwo air field as set out in paragraph two of my telegram K.308 has been reached except that 'illegal flights' has been changed to 'flights not in accordance with international conventions'.
