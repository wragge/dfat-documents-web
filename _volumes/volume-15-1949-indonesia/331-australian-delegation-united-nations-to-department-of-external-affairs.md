# 331 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN219 NEW YORK, 30 March 1949, 6.23 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

At meeting of Delhi representatives today some objections were raised to the inclusion of Indonesia as agenda item chiefly by Iran, Egypt and Iraq. China also expressed some doubts on the ground that action would not be favoured by Security Council.

India and ourselves mentioned that inclusion of item at beginning of session did not necessarily mean that there would be immediate discussion and there would still be time to see whether present processes were likely to lead to satisfactory results. We said also that it could be made clear that there is no intention of criticizing the Security Council and that the sole object of inclusion would be to support the Security Council in endeavour to ensure compliance with January resolution. [1]

2\. No conclusion was reached by the meeting. India and ourselves both think, however, that we should go ahead in association with as many others of the group who wish to go along. It is uncertain how many will be so prepared but in any case, there will be no open opposition on the part of any of the group when the matter comes up.

3\. Have discussed briefly with Minister today but prior to meeting. He seemed to contemplate that great majority of group would be in agreement but I think also that action by even 4 or 5, including India, would be in line with intentions. I will assume this to be the case unless I hear to the contrary from you.
