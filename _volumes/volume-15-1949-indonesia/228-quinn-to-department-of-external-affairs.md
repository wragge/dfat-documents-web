# 228 Quinn to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hague 24 THE HAGUE, [17 February] 1949, 12.05 a.m.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL

In a statement to the Second Chamber yesterday, the new Minister for Overseas Territories, Van Maarseveen, reaffirmed the government support for Van Royen's statements [1] on the Security Council resolution. [2] On the question of continued occupation of the Republican Territory by the Dutch forces, the Minister pointed out that the restoration of law and order was a necessary condition for the execution of the wishes of both parties. The occupation had been necessary because Indonesia was threatened by territories now occupied.

2\. Broadly, the aims of the Dutch and the United Nations coincided in the maintenance of law and order. The same applied to the adherence to the Renville principles [3] , the holding of free and democratic elections and the transfer of sovereignty to U.S.I. The differences could be narrowed down to procedure.

3\. In analysis of the resolution the Minister claimed its [1st] recommendation had been observed and that now only 'active defence' against guerilla bands was being conducted.

Implementation of third recommendation, a 'proper place' in the interim organisation, had been offered to the Republican leaders.

These showed no inclination to accept it. They demanded the releasing of prisoners and their positive return to Djokja to exercise full authority there and in the surrounding territory, as well as free communication with all persons in Indonesia. This was demanding the impossible. The Republicans had so far shown no signs of complying with the resolution's first recommendation. The Netherlands authority in Indonesia was for the time being the only support for law and order in these areas. This would be dealt an irreparable blow if the Republican leaders were to be restored to their authority in Djokja.

4\. It is considered extension, as desired by Security Council, of U.N.C.I. jurisdiction to territories which already co-operate with the Dutch, [i]s 'intolerable violation of Dutch sovereignty by United Nations'.

5\. In regard to the release of Republican leaders, 'good friends at home and abroad' had urged this. The matter would be discussed with Beel. Erion [4] was asked if release would be compatible with Dutch responsibility.

6\. The Netherlands and Indonesian Governments faced the problems of preventing chaos and avoiding a break with the United Nations.

There was, in any case, no possibility of the Dutch 'abandoning' Indonesia.

7\. There is no difference of opinion about the aims to be achieved; creation of U.S. of I. including the Republican territory and with Republican leaders occupying important positions. Difficulty has so far been the interim period as the Republic was unwilling to give up before the sovereignty of the Federation could be established.
