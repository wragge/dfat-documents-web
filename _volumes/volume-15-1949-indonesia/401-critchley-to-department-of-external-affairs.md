# 401 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K312 BATAVIA, 16 May 1949, 3.45 p.m.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTED

Your telegram 85. [1]

In the progressive report of sub-committee 1, ('Return to Djokjakarta' (K310 [2])) the Dutch have made the following commitments regarding the supply of materials and equipment to the Republican Government.

(a) To 'place at the disposal of the Republican Government the necessary materials and equipment for the operation of services of a Federal character and other public utility services in the territory of the Republic';

(b) to supply 'as much as possible of stationery and other materials which will be needed' by the Departments;

(c) to make available road transport equipment to the Republic, the number of vehicles being based upon (1) the need to transport normal imports until railway communications are restored;

(2) the needs of various services and public utilities;

(d) to 'supply the Republican Government with essential goods on the same basis as for other parts of Federal Indonesia which came under the control of the provisional Federal Government after December 19th 1948, taking into consideration the special circumstances connected with the return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta'.

2\. The delegations are at present engaged in working out the quantities in Batavia. I shall advise as soon as possible the extent to which the Dutch will supply the Republican requirements.

3\. If the Dutch do not supply essential Republican requirements this will no doubt be considered by the Commission and I shall endeavour to ensure an appropriate report to the Security Council.
