We have received from the Ministry of External Affairs an Aide- memoire containing suggestions for future co-operation between countries represented at the Asian Conference. These suggestions were discussed at an informal meeting called by Nehru on January 24th. The Ministry has requested that the Australian Government's comments on the proposal in the Aide-memoire be communicated to the Indian Government by the end of February. The Aide-memoire is summarised in my immediately following telegram. [1]
