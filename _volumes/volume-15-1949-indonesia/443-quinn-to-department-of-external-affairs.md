# 443 Quinn to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hague 82 THE HAGUE, 18 June 1949, 6.55 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

INDONESIA

Your telegram 41. [1]

I saw the Secretary-General this morning.

2\. Boon stated that as far as the Netherlands Government was concerned it was definitely their intention to start R.T.C. in the second half of July and they had made hotel bookings and other administrative preparations accordingly.

3\. Further evidence of the Netherlands Government's desire to press ahead was the departure of Van Maarseveen yesterday (my telegram 41 [2]). Boon pointed out that this Minister would have to defend the Government's policy in the Chambers Hilder [3] and would make every effort to ensure that there would be no failure.

4\. I referred to past evidences of a difference in the sense of urgency as between officials in Batavia and in The Hague as one reason why we should be concerned at any suggestion of delay. He replied that it was true that Batavia had lagged in the past but that they were now if anything ahead of The Hague. Van Maarseveen's visit should still further accelerate the matter. The Netherlands Government was not committed to backing Hatta and this [4] was accordingly hardly [5] in their interests. Moreover there was evidence of growing local Communist strength and of an increase in outside support for Communist factions.

5\. In reply to my remark that Jogjakarta negotiations seem to be proceeding satisfactorily he said that technical questions connected with the cease-fire must be tackled constructively and expressed particular satisfaction with Pryor's work. The 'Book of Rules' [6] being produced in conjunction with the Military Observers would help considerably.

6\. Boon readily took the point regarding importance of having tangible results before the Assembly opens.

7\. Interview was friendly and at the conclusion Boon expressed satisfaction at the opportunity to give the foregoing assurances.

I understand Teppema will be informed of our approach.
