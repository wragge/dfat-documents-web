# 327 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN216 NEW YORK, 28 March 1949, 7.14 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

Indian Delegation here received instructions last week [1] and again yesterday [2] to concert with us in seeking inclusion of Indonesia on Assembly Agenda. Their instructions said that this was being undertaken at suggestion of Australian Government which desired joint action by Australia and India.

2\. In the absence of any advice from you, I have asked India to defer taking steps on their own until I have learned what the position was. They are anxious now, however, to go ahead tomorrow with or without us. I have been trying to reach you by telephone today but if I am unable to do so please inform urgently to what extent, if any, I should join with the Indians. They wish also to have informal meeting of Delhi Group Representatives on Wednesday with view to discussing how the matter should be handled in the Assembly.
