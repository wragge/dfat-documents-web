# 546 McIntyre to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram unnumbered BATAVIA, 28 December 1949, 6.05 p.m.

Transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia took place smoothly yesterday afternoon. Transfer was brief and quite impressive. Special Overseas Representatives, Consular Corps, U.N.C.I. Delegates and a few other guests were addressed in the Palace by Lovink and Sultan of Djokjakarta. Transfer protocol was read and signed. The Queen's speech from The Hague was heard by radio. Netherlands flag on Palace was struck and Indonesian flag raised in its place to the playing of national anthem. Final ceremony outside Palace was watched by an undemonstrative crowd and there were no incidents.

Lovink left for Holland by air immediately afterwards. Later in the evening I handed copies of Prime Minister's and Minister's messages to Roem. [1] This morning President Soekarno made his ceremonial entry Batavia from Djokjakarta and took up residence in the Palace where he addressed an enormous and enthusiastic crowd which pressed up to the Palace steps in a tremendous demonstration of affection for the President. He later received all Foreign Representatives.
