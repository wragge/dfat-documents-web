# 149 Nehru to Chifley

## Cablegram 65/120 NEW DELHI, 23 January 1949, 7.50 p.m.

Excellency, three Resolutions [1] adopted by the Conference on Indonesia, held in New Delhi from 20th to 23rd January, have been communicated to your Representative. In view of the urgency of the Indonesian question the Conference authorised me to communicate the 1st Resolution to the Chairman of the Security Council and this has already been done.

2\. I seize this opportunity to thank your Excellency for the participation of your Government in this important Conference, historic in the Annals of Asia and to renew the assurance of my highest consideration.
