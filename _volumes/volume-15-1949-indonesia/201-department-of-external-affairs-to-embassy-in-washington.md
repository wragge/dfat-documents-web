# 201 Department of External Affairs to Embassy in Washington

Cablegram 75 CANBERRA, 9 February 1949, 3.10 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Your 105. [1]

Assume you keep Hood informed. We consider Cochran has no right to act separately now that Commission is formed. Situation is most serious since there is complete failure to carry out even cease- fire and release of prisoners [2] and even so there is no move taken in Security Council to follow up its decisions. This reflects both on Council and on sponsoring powers. Please keep pressing our point of view at Washington and at New York.
