# 241 Department of External Affairs to High Commission in New Delhi

Cablegram 89 CANBERRA, 24 February 1949, 5 p.m.

SECRET

INDONESIA

Your 142. [1]

The Indian High Commissioner in Canberra has expressed similar concern. We have told him that we fully share this, and that we had in fact already instructed Australian representative on United Nations Commission on Indonesia to urge his colleagues to delay no further reporting to the Security Council on Dutch non-compliance with Resolution [2] of 28th January. Critchley's reply (see our immediately following telegram [3]) had indicated however that American representative could not be persuaded to report before 1st March.

We consider Dutch must observe Security Council Resolution and must not be allowed to evade it by sponsoring counter proposals which are ostensibly in accord with the 'spirit' of the Resolution but which are in reality quite unacceptable to the Republic.
