# 3 Kevin to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 4 NEW DELHI, 2 January 1949, 10.15 p.m.

Our number 3. [1] Speaking about Indonesia yesterday at Allahabad Pandit Nehru said that all freedom-loving countries should co- operate in protecting freedom from this onslaught. This co- operation should be within the United Nations. Continuing, he dealt with Marshall Aid to Holland and after traversing the Security Council treatment of the Indonesian issue, said that the least that can be done in Indonesia immediately is:-

(1) The withdrawal of all Dutch forces to the line which they occupied previously;

(2) An inquiry into the Dutch action;

(3) The stopping of all aid in any form to Holland;

(4) Conditions to be created in which the Indonesian Republic can function.
