# 126 High Commission in London to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 249 LONDON, [20 January 1949], 7.30 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

Your 201. [1]

Your views were put to the United Kingdom authorities yesterday afternoon and last night instructions were settled for Cadogan suggesting certain amendments to the American draft resolution [2] copy of which was received yesterday. My impression is that though United Kingdom Government will support a resolution along the lines of the American resolution they have not instructed Cadogan to go as far as we think necessary. I understand that Cadogan's instructions, though they refer to detailed points in the American resolution, are not categorical and he is given some discretion.
