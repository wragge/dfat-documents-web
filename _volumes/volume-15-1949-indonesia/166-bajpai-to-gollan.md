# 166 Bajpai to Gollan

## Letter NEW DELHI, 27 January 1949

The Prime Minister will be grateful if you will convey the following reply to Dr. Evatt's message which you were good enough to communicate to me in your letter of the 25th January, 1949. [1]

'Many thanks for your message. We should have been delighted to have you with us during the deliberations of the Indonesian Conference but realise that this was not possible. Your delegation, however, made a constructive contribution to the work of the conference and I should like you to know that all of us greatly appreciated the ability and initiative of Dr. Burton.

Like you, I welcome the close co-operation of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand and assure you that India will always be ready to play her part in ensuring unity of understanding and action among these and other like-minded countries in matters of common interest.

Kindest personal wishes. Jawaharlal Nehru.'
