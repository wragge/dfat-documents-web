# 41 Department of External Affairs to Forde

Cablegram 6 CANBERRA, 7 January 1949

CONFIDENTIAL

It is noted from your despatch 87 [1] that it has been stated in conversation with the Canadians that expulsion of the Netherlands from the United Nations is a solution advocated by Australia. This was not put forward as a formal proposal by Hodgson and is not to be advocated as Australia's policy.

_

1 In this dispatch, dated 31 December 1948, Forde enclosed a memorandum of a conversation between the official secretary of the High Commission, Stewart Jamieson, and the Canadian Department of External Affairs (see Document 497 in Volume XIII). Jamieson seemed to have suggested that the expulsion of the Netherlands from the United Nations was Australian policy.
