# 310 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN208 NEW YORK, 22 March 1949, 2.58 p.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

INDONESIA

My telegram 207. [1] In the course of his statement yesterday in the Security Council, Palar said that the Dutch were destroying buildings and removing administrative and other equipment from Djokjakarta, apparently with the aim of making it physically impossible for the Republican Government to be restored there or to resume its functions. He asked for an immediate report from U.N.C.I. on the position in this respect.

2\. The Indian Delegation here has had similar information and there appear to be grounds for real concern that Dutch by this means might be planning to circumvent the object of the proposed preliminary meeting with the Republican Leaders. With this in mind India and ourselves will try to get some specific provision in the formula referred to in my 207 to ensure that the Dutch properly carry out their obligations under paragraph 2 of the January resolution. [2] But it seems to be a matter in which the U.N.C.I.

might think it necessary to take some initiative. Have you any information which I could use tomorrow?
