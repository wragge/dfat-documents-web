# 31 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN2 NEW YORK, [5 January 1949]

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

In letter dated 3rd January [1] to McNaughton the Netherlands representative referred to statements made by Van Royjen on December 27 and 29 [2] concerning Security Council resolutions of December 24 [3] and 28. [4] He stated that before Netherlands Government had taken decision on resolutions several communications were received by Netherlands Delegation in Batavia from G.O.C. to which in one instance (G.O.C. letter of 28 December [5]) a reply was requested on the day Netherlands Delegation received letter. He stated it was impossible in this case for Netherlands Delegation to reply before Netherlands Government had taken decision on resolution.

2\. Netherlands Government suggests that in order to avoid any possible duplication confusion and misunderstanding questions the subject of the direct discussion within the Security Council should not at the time be dealt with by executive organs in Indonesia of Netherlands and G.O.C.

3\. The letter claimed certain statements of G.O.C. are incorrect, for example, that all military observers have been concentrated in Batavia (G.O.C. report of 29 December [6]). Dutch claim some military observers have remained in the field since beginning of the action.

4\. Letter concludes-'Instructions to enable the Committee of Good Offices, the Consular Commission and the military observers to carry out the task which has been assigned to them, have been sent to the Indonesian Government in Batavia and these organs will be informed forthwith concerning the implementation of these instructions. It should be pointed out however, that certain practical difficulties will have to be overcome and that visits of these organs to certain areas may entail considerable personal risk for which the Netherlands must disclaim responsibility'.
