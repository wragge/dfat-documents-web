# 188 Forde to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 42 OTTAWA, 3 February 1949, 1.19 p.m.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

Your 31. [1]

Your message No.17 [2], of the 29th January to High Commissioner, London (repeated here as No. 29), was passed on the morning of Saturday, 29th January to the Prime Minister [3] and Secretary of State for External Affairs [4] by hand delivery letter at their request since an effort to obtain an interview with them on that morning had failed.

Canadian press had already indicated on that morning passage of U.S. resolution [5] substantially in original form by the Security Council and it was known that Canada had supported the U.S.

resolution.

Both the Prime Minister and Secretary of State acknowledged receipt of your message regarding United Kingdom policy in writing but did not comment.

In view of the fact that the question had already been resolved in the Security Council before arrival of your telegram. I did not seek any further comment from Canadian authorities.

In view of your No. 31, however, I am seeking interview with Secretary of State for External Affairs and result will be telegraphed to you as soon as possible.
