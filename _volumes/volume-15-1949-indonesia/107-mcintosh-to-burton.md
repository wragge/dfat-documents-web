# 107 McIntosh to Burton

Cablegram 26 CANBERRA, 19 January 1949, 10 a.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Thank you for message from Singapore. [1] The New Zealand Government adheres strongly to the view that Mr. Shanahan's status is purely that of observer. Special stress has had to be laid on public statements here to this effect. It has been made clear that as observer he will have no authority to commit the Government in any way and that his function is merely to report on proceedings and conclusions. No modification likely unless the Prime Minister [2] on his return next week directs otherwise.
