# 350 Department of External Affairs to High Commisison in New Delhi

Cablegram 163 CANBERRA, 11 April 1949, 12.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

Indonesia Your 261. [1]

We are sending you by separate telegram [2] text of a draft resolution which we have prepared for submission to the Assembly.

We have sent it to the Minister in New York. It has not his approval in detail but will serve you as a guide to the way we are thinking about the Indonesian problem. As you know, the United Nations Commission is trying to bring the two parties together to discuss the restoration of the Republican Government at Djokjakarta in accordance with the Security Council's directive [3] of 23rd March. We believe that the object of the Dutch will be to protract any such preliminary discussions and to use the fact that they are going on as any excuse for damping down discussion in the Assembly. As we do not believe that the Dutch intend to restore the Republican Government at Djokjakarta, we feel strongly that the Assembly should not be diverted by any Dutch manoeuvre from discussing the whole problem arising out of the failure of the Dutch to implement the Security Council's resolution [4] of 28th January.
