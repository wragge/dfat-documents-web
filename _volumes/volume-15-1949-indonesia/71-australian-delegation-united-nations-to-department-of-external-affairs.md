1\. Following is supplementary to our 8. [1]

In his statement, Jessup accused the Dutch of violating the Charter, defying the December resolutions [2] and the Renville Agreement [3], and giving the United Nations accounts of the Indonesian war not conforming to facts. Though formal hostilities have ended in Dutch victory, he made it clear the whole problem remained a matter of International concern.

2\. He warned the Dutch they may 'Let loose forces of terror, chaos and sabotage' rather than establish law and order. United States Government dissociated itself from any aspect of Netherlands' military action which may mean a victory to the forces of anarchy.

3\. Jessup stated United States Government can find no adequate justification for military action taken by the Netherlands. He emphasized G.O.C.'s condemnatory reports against the Dutch and stated that, despite assurances to the Council that resolutions on cease fire and release of political prisoners had been complied with, neither United States Government nor G.O.C. considered this was the case. Jessup said fundamental steps towards solution could be fixing definite date for elections and the transfer of Sovereignty to U.S.I. United States Government considers after the election and establishment of a provisional regime, authority should be turned over progressively.

4\. Jessup accused U.S.S.R. of throwing up obstacles to Indonesian solution in the same way as Moscow had obstructed operation of United Nations, he said Soviet opposed an independent Indonesia and, through the Communist party, sought to undermine and overthrow the Republican Government.

5\. Malik defended the Soviet position and criticized 'Anglo- American majority' for not adopting Paris resolutions condemning Dutch and ordering withdrawal of troops. He declared United States monopolies need a colonial Indonesia and have supported Dutch action by granting Marshall aid.

6\. Toward the end of the Meeting, McNaughton remarked that a solid resolution was needed. He asked members to confer and present a concrete proposal to Council on Friday.
