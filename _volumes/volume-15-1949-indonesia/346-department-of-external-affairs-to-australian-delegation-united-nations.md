RESTRICTED

Our previous telegram. [1] Draft resolution. begins- whereas by the Linggadjati Agreement [2] the representatives of the Netherlands Government and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia expressed a sincere desire to ensure good relations between the peoples of the Netherlands and Indonesia in new forms of voluntary co-operation which offer the best guarantee for a sound and strong development of both countries in the future and which makes it possible to give a new foundation to the relationship between the two peoples;

whereas by the Linggadjati and Renville [3] Agreements the representatives of the Netherlands Government and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia agreed to co-operate in the rapid formation of a sovereign democratic state on a federal base to be called the United States of Indonesia;

whereas under the Charter of the United Nations Member States have agreed to settle their disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice are not endangered, and have undertaken to carry out the decisions of the Security Council;

whereas all members of the United Nations have agreed to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations;

whereas on 21st July 1947, and again on 18th December 1948, armed forces of the Netherlands, for the purpose of destroying the Republic, launched military operations against and occupied the territory of the Republic of Indonesia;

whereas on 30th July 1947 the Security Council took cognisance of the dispute between the Government of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and has on various occasions called on the parties to settle their dispute by peaceful means and to enter into negotiations for the establishment of a United States of Indonesia;

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 1. CONSIDERS that the military action launched by the Netherlands Government against the Republic on 18th December 1948 constitutes a flagrant breach of the Charter of the United Nations and defiance of the efforts of the Security Council to bring about a peaceful settlement in Indonesia;

2\. RECOGNISES that the Security Council which has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security has called upon the parties to take measures for the settlement of the dispute;

3\. endorses the action of the Security Council in its resolution [4] of 28th January 1949 in calling for the immediate discontinuance of all its military operations, the immediate and unconditional release by the Government of the Netherlands of all political prisoners arrested by them since 17th December 1948, and the provision by the Government of the Netherlands of facilities for the immediate return of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to Djokjakarta with full powers of administration;

4\. ENDORSES the recommendation of the Security Council in its resolution of 28th January 1949 that negotiations be undertaken as soon as possible by representatives of the Government of the Netherlands and representatives of the Government of Indonesia, with the assistance of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia, in the interest of carrying out the expressed objectives and desires of both parties to establish a federal, independent, and sovereign United States of Indonesia at the earliest possible date;

5\. NOTES that at this date the decisions of the Security Council have failed to be implemented in the following respects which represent a breach by the Government of the Netherlands of its obligations under the Charter:

I. Neither the military operations of the Government of the Netherlands nor the guerilla warfare of the Government of the Republic have ceased;

II. The Government of the Netherlands has not yet released unconditionally all political prisoners arrested in the Republic of Indonesia since 17th December 1948;

III. The Government of the Netherlands has not yet facilitated the return of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to Djokjakarta;

6\. CONSIDERS that until the Government of the Netherlands has carried out its obligations under paragraph 5 of this Resolution, the progressive restoration of the civil administration of the Republic in areas controlled by the Republic under the Renville Agreement cannot be carried out; the Government of the Republic will be unable to discharge its responsibilities and exercise its appropriate functions in full freedom; and the Government of the Republic will not be able to take part in negotiations with the Government of the Netherlands in the knowledge that it reflects the opinion and desires of the Republican people;

7\. NOTES the absence of any recommended procedure for the withdrawal of Netherlands forces in a manner consistent with the implementation of the resolution of 28th January 1949;

8\. NOTES with concern the deterioration in the economic life of the area consequent upon the interruption of internal and external trade and domestic production caused by Netherlands military action and Netherlands restrictions on trade and the interruption in the free use by the Government of the Republic of facilities for communication with the outside world;

9\. CALLS the attention of the Security Council to- I. the situation described in paragraphs 5,6,7 and 8 of this resolution and to the serious delay in the implementation of the Security Council's decisions which together continue to endanger international peace and security, and II. the urgency of a settlement of the dispute by the Security Council in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and the desire of all peace-loving members of the United Nations;

10\. TRANSMITS to the Security Council the records of the discussion in the General Assembly of the Indonesian question, expressing its concern that orders by the Council have not been implemented.
