# 214 Department of External Affairs to Hood

Cablegram 96 CANBERRA, 15 February 1949

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

It would seem desirable to avoid any public statement on Indonesia at this juncture until the position is clearer from The Hague. At the same time you should make it clear that we have not altered our views in any way.
