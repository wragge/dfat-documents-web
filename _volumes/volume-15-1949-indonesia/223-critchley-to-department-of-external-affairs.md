# 223 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K271 BATAVIA, 16 February 1949, 1 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

I am disappointed with the Commission's decision to postpone the date of its report to the Security Council as set out in my en clair telegram. [1] I was also unimpressed by Cochran's arguments but hope to be able to modify his views during the next fortnight.
