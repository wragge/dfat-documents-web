# 332 Department of External Affairs to Critchley

## Cablegram 63 CANBERRA, 31 March 1949, 6 p.m.

Fact that economic blockade still exists is being lost sight of from point of view of conditions of preliminary discussions. It would seem to be at least as important as re-establishment of the capital. Please advise position.
