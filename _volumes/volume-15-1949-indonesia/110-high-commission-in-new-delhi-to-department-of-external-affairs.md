# 110 High Commission in New Delhi to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 49 NEW YORK, 19 January 1949, 1.55 p.m.

SECRET

Our 32. [1]

As already advised, Conference will meet in open session at 11 a.m. on 20th January, thereafter going into closed session. 15 countries plus four countries which have given specific notice that they will be represented by observers (China, New Zealand, Nepal, Siam) will be in attendance.

One aspect to which some reference should be made is the impression earlier created here by the United Kingdom's attitude towards the Dutch police action. There is a case for saying it threatened, at any rate at one period, to delay, if not prejudice, the prospects of India deciding to remain in the British Commonwealth. It is our opinion that the position has been favourably counter-balanced by the Australian decision to come in on the Delhi meeting along with New Zealand.

1 Dispatched on 15 January, it reported a statement of the US Ambassador to India that an Asian Conference supportive of the United Nations would be greatly beneficial.
