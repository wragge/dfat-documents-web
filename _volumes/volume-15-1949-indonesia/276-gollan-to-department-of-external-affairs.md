# 276 Gollan to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 182 NEW DELHI, 5 March 1949, 3.20 p.m.

SECRET

INDONESIA

According to Bajpai, Soekarno has written to Beel saying that he is hopeful of a Hague Conference provided the Indonesians can first function as a Government. Soekarno also insists that any such meeting must be without prejudice to member nations of the Commission, which Bajpai interprets as meaning that any conference must be under the Commission's auspices.

Bajpai has privately seen a State Department aide-memoire [1] to the effect that the United States still remains undisposed to interfere in any way with Marshall aid to Holland.

1 The text of the Department of State's aide-memoire dated 2 March for the Indian Embassy in Washington is given in Department of state, Foreign Relation of the United States, 1949, vol. VII, Washington, 1975, pp.287-8. The aide-memorie argued against the United States '... assuming a unilateral and arbitrary if well- intentioned role'.
