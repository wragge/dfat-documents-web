# 215 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K268 BATAVIA, 15 February 1949, 12.30 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

Cochran claims that he has not been sold a bill of goods by the Dutch and that he is in Indonesia to see that the Council's resolution [1] is implemented. At the same time, he warns that a critical report of the Dutch Parliament may cause the fall of the Cabinet and seriously jeopardise the Commission work in Indonesia.

I have prepared a draft report which brings out strongly the Dutch non-compliance and refers the problem to the Security Council. I believe that Cochran might want to water this down and that Herremans will agree.

I should be glad of immediate instructions as to whether in this event I should maintain a minority position.
