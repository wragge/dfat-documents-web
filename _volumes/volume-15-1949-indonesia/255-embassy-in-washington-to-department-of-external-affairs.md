Your 117 [1] to Australian Delegation to United Nations, New York.

During a Press Conference, 26th February, Van Kleffens made statement, the text of which is contained in our immediately preceding telegram. [2]

It appears Van Kleffens had in mind that the basis for round-table conference would not be the Security Council Resolution [3] nor the whole Cochran Plan [4], but selected points on which tentative agreement was reached, e.g. Hatta's letter to Cochran of 13th December [5], in the conversations between Hatta and Stikker.
