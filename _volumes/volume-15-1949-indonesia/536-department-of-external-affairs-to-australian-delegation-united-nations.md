# 536 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 601 CANBERRA, 30 November 1949

RESTRICTED

Our 561. [1]

United States Embassy here, in an Aide Memoire [2], has suggested that Powers attending New Delhi Conference might take initiative in sponsoring resolution on Indonesia. We concur in this suggestion and consider that you should join with other Powers which attended New Delhi Conference in presenting a draft resolution along the lines of our telegram 561. Indonesian question should then be removed from the General Assembly Agenda, it being clear that matter has now reached stage where General Assembly supervision is no longer necessary.

2\. United States Government considers that insofar as Security Council is concerned, there may be more detailed discussion, but there should be no alteration to the Commission's terms of reference or any move to establish a new commission. Our views on exact function of Commission will be forwarded to you for information within a few days.

1 Dispatched on 11 November, it instructed the Australian Delegation to the United Nations Assembly to welcome the agreement reached at The Hague, to suggest the desirability of the new federal Indonesian State joining the United Nations, to indicate Australia's willingness to assist the new State economically, and to pay tribute to the United Nations Commission for Indonesia in helping the parties to reach agreement.
