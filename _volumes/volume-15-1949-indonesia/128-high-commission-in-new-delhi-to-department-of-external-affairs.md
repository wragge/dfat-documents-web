# 128 High Commission in New Delhi to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 56 NEW DELHI, 20 January 1949, 10.30 p.m.

Burton's speech [1] at Asian Conference has evoked favourable comment in all quarters including those one or two sections where some sensitiveness might perhaps have been expected. There has as yet been no time for published comment but private reaction available to us from officials both foreign and local and on the part of the press suggest a good impression has been created by Australia.
