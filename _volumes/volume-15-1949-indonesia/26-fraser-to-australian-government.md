# 26 Fraser to Australian Government

Cablegram 2 WELLINGTON, 5 January 194[9], 9.20 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

INDONESIA

Reference your telegram No. 1 of 3rd January. [1]

We are now informed by our High Commissioner in London [2] that on 3rd January he was approached by the High Commissioner for India [3] and notified officially that the Prime Minister of India was calling a Conference on Indonesia in New Delhi on 16th January.

The hope was expressed that the Conference would be on a Ministerial level. It was emphasised by the Indian High Commissioner that the Conference is not intended to supersede the authority of the United Nations but is an expression of a desire to confer with like-minded peoples on Indonesian problems.

We are still considering the position presented by this invitation and hope shortly to be able to inform you of our final views.
