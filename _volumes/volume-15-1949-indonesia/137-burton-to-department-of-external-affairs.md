# 137 Burton to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 70 NEW DELHI, 21 January 1949, 9.15 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

My immediately following telegram contains text of draft resolution to be submitted to the Conference tomorrow. There will be minor Amendments only.

2\. The procedure is likely to be a public session tomorrow afternoon, Saturday, at which resolutions are formally moved and adopted by Conference; chairman will then be asked to communicate resolution to Secretary-General and probably Australia and India and perhaps one other will be asked to present case to Council.

3\. It may be, however, that some representati[ves] may say they cannot agree to resolution without the approval from Government and agreement may therefore [be] ad referendum. [You] will appreciate that while you are being sent draft of text others will not see these until tomorrow and will have no opportunity to obtain instructions.

4\. Glad of immediate instructions as to whether.

(a). We can agree now.

(b). Agreement should be ad referendum.

(c). There can be no publicity of these texts as they draft only and moreover conference may decide to submit to Secretary-General prior to publication.
