# 292 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram unnumbered BATAVIA, 11 March 1949, 1.10 p.m.

Following is text of letter [1] dated 10th March from Republican Delegation to Commission telegraphed to Security Council today.

Begins- As misunderstandings appear to have been created by President Sukarno's reply [2] of 4th March to invitation of High Representative of Crown, Dr. Beel, to attend a round table conference, I have the honour to confirm clarifications given your Commission during our discussions today.

In his letter President Sukarno stated he found idea of early and unconditional transfer of sovereignty as explained by Dr. Koets attractive. President could, therefore, personally agree in principle with purpose of holding meeting to consider ways and means of arranging for such transfer a year earlier than ultimate date of 1st July, 1950 mentioned in Security Council resolution.

President, however, stipulated that Conference should not prejudice position of United Nations Commission for Indonesia.

This in accordance with my previous message of 28th February [3], which emphasised that round table conference could never be considered as an alternative to Security Council resolution. [4]

It might be practicable to hold a conference which would be helpful to work of United Nations Commission and which would take place within general framework of Security Council resolution.

Commission would naturally retain functions and initiative envisaged by resolution and status of Republic as one of parties to dispute would not be affected.

At this stage, however, President has explained he cannot personally take decision on Beel's invitation, but that decision must be left to Republican Government when re-established and functioning freely at Djokjakarta as called for by Security Council.

In meantime, measures required by Security Council resolution should not be held up. Should be no further delay in releasing political prisoners, in beginning restoration of civil administration of Republic, in re-establishing its Government at Djokjakarta and in bringing hostilities in Indonesia to end.

Signed-Rum.

Ends.
