We understand Dutch are pressing United States and other Governments for few days in which to decide response to Security Council and are bringing forward alternative proposals. Questions such as cease-fire and release of prisoners call for immediate action, regardless of alternatives, and you should see representatives specially of United States of America and United Kingdom to ensure no weakening and that Council resolution [1] is immediately implemented.
