# 304 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 153 CANBERRA, 21 March 1949, 11.30 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

We consider that it is most important that no conference should be convened at The Hague. New York, Ceylon, Australia, are among alternatives. Effect of Hague would be bad and you should resist it.
