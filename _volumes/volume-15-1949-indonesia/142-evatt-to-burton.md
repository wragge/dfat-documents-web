# 142 Evatt to Burton

## Cablegram 45 SYDNEY, 22 January 1949

MOST IMMEDIATE

1\. Much appreciate your valuable work but it is impossible to give detailed consideration and all your voting must be ad referendum.

This is safest as Prime Minister not available and Cabinet meets Thursday.

2\. In meantime suggest following drafting amendments- 1. Omit flagrant in early part of preamble before breach.

2\. Substitute a full measure of self-government for words their independence towards end of preamble.

3\. Instead of date fifteenth March nineteen forty nine three times occurring say at earliest possible moment.

You will appreciate it is impossible to pin down to timetable because it looks impracticable. Next amendment in paragraph A2 four substitute embargoes for restrictions, next omit paragraph B altogether. In second resolution instead of paragraph C suggest a sub-committee of four including Australia to continue to assist in carrying out resolution. This sub-committee could meet New York or elsewhere in any of the countries. Next add as paragraph D following Begins-In event either party not repeat not complying Security Council recommendations above sub-committee should meet again and its members support reference of matter to Assembly in April. Third resolution then becomes unnecessary. Ends.
