# 133 Burton to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 61 NEW DELHI, 21 January 1949, 12.05 p.m.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTED

Asian Conference.

First private session held last night revealed most remarkable attempt to deal with the subject matter objectively and on basis of facts. Nehru displayed detailed knowledge and sound practical sense was very generally displayed. There was continued agreement that the United Nations instrumentalities should be used including the Good Offices Committee. Questions of withdrawal schedule, Interim Government, powers, elections, supervision, et cetera, were discussed and drafting of report on this aspect now established Australia, [Pakistan] and Ceylon. [1] Next step will be to consider steps which should be taken if the Council fails to act or the Dutch to implement and finally what organisation is required to keep the Governments here in touch so that recommendations can be taken if the Council or the Dutch fail to act.
