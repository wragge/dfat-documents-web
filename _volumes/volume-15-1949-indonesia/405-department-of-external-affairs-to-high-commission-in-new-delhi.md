# 405 Department of External Affairs to High Commission in New Delhi

## Cablegram 188 CANBERRA, 17 May 1949, 12 noon

Your 185. [1]

We agree with Indian view except that we doubt the practicability of calling upon so-called stocks of United Nations Administration for the purpose. When Security Council reviews the position there may be a case for recommending expenditure by the Secretary- General from the Capital Fund although this would obviously create a precedent for other cases. We are suggesting to our mission in New York that they explore the position together with the Indian representative.
