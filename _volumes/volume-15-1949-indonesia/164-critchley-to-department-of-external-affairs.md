# 164 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K259 BATAVIA, 27 January 1949, 1 p.m.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL

If four power resolution [1] is adopted by Security Council a Commission for Indonesia will be established immediately. Although Belgium may seek delays it will be important for America and Australia to maintain the initiative here. I should therefore be glad of instructions as to whether I am to participate as Australian Representative in the event of Commission being set up.
