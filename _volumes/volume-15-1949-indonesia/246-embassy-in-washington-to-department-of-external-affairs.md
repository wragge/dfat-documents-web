RESTRICTED

INDONESIA

Your 113 [1] to Australian Delegation, United Nations Organisation, New York. State Department expect Dutch statement tomorrow to be along lines indicated by Critchley. So far as we can ascertain no special representations have yet been made to Van Kleffens or The Hague. State Department view seems to be that representations at this stage could not possibly be effective in modifying Dutch Cabinet decision. State Department agree with Cochran that Commission will have no alternative but to report Dutch non-compliance.

2\. State Department are interested in report that Minister is to visit New Delhi and would appreciate any information we are able to give on his talks with Nehru. We have explained that we have no information apart from radio reports.
