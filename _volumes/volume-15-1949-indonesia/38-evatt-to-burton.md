# 38 Evatt to Burton

## Cablegram unnumbered SS DOMINION MONARCH, 7 January 1949

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your telegram re conference [1] is first report since Monday.

Suggestion you should go to India at present is impracticable:

clearly you should stick to your post, meeting me Perth as arranged. Gollan or Critchley or McIntyre could attend on official level if conference met in meantime. Obviously you must be close at hand from time of my arrival in Australia. Please inform the Prime Minister.
