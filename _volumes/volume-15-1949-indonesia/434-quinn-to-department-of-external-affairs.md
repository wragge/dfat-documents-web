# 434 Quinn to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hague 78 THE HAGUE, 15 June 1949, 2.35 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

J.H. van Maarseveen, who will shortly be confirmed in office as Minister for Overseas Territories, is to visit Indonesia shortly, possibly departing as early as June 17th. The proposed visit, while primarily designed to give the Minister background before the R.T.C. opens, appears also to be connected with the cease-fire difficulties.

2\. J.R. van Schaik, Minister without Portfolio, will become Minister for Home Affairs.
