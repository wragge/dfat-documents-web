# 92 Ballard to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 185 BATAVIA, 19 June 1947

SECRET

Your telegram No.151. [1]

Sjahrir returned to Batavia yesterday afternoon and I gave him the Minister's message this morning. He was delighted with it and sends warm thanks.

We had some conversation about the political situation, in the course of which he said he did not understand why the Dutch found the Indonesian reply so unsatisfactory-it was not an ultimatum, as theirs was, nor did it purport to be the last Indonesian word on the subject. He conveyed the impression that the Indonesians would continue to seek a way out and avoid provocation. He dismissed stories of Indonesian disunity as 'fairy-tales'.

He has not been in touch with the Commission-General since his return and said he was thinking of making a public statement before he did so.
