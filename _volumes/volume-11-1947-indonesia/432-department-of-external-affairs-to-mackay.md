# 432 Department of External Affairs to Mackay

Cablegram 481 CANBERRA, 24 November 1947

IMPORTANT SECRET

Your 627 and 633. [1] We are prepared to make arrangements for Sjahrir's accommodation in Australia but do not think it expedient that he should be received here as the official guest of the Australian Government or that the Government should be responsible for the expenses of his visit. He will himself realise the reasons for our attitude, which is at same time, not inconsistent with his being given a most cordial welcome in Australia.

_

1 Dispatched on 20 and 22 November respectively these cablegrams reported that Sjahrir planned to fly from New Delhi to Australia via Singapore and asked whether he would be a guest of the Australian Government during his stay.
