# 317 Sjarifuddin to Chifley

## Cablegram 300 [1] BATAVIA, 7 September 1947

I have the honour to request you, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Indonesia, to arrange for the Commonwealth of Australia to represent Indonesia on the United Nations Three-Power Commission which will assemble in the future to endeavour to find a lasting and peaceful solution to the Indonesian-Dutch dispute.

I again thank you sincerely for all your efforts and support in the past, and I pray that your future endeavours may be crowned with success.
