# 123 Burton to Ballard

Cablegram 193 CANBERRA, 19 July 1947, 3 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 230. [1]

1\. My immediately following telegram is copy of message sent on 16th July to Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. [2]

2\. With respect to our willingness to mediate, previous messages have made this clear. The position has not changed.

3\. If a point is reached when there cannot be further compromise and therefore no firm agreement, the only method of keeping open negotiations would be publicly to ask for mediation. It will be recalled that Lord Killearn made possible the first step towards agreement and Republican authorities might regard him acting personally and not on behalf of any government as an acceptable mediator.
