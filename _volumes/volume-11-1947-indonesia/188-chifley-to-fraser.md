# 188 Chifley to Fraser

Cablegram 200 CANBERRA, 30 July 1947, 10.45 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Many thanks for your messages [1], all of which have been most helpful in assessing our position.

2\. We have given further thought to most effective way of having hostilities cease immediately and have decided to call attention of the Security Council to the situation, not under Article 35, which would permit an investigation, but under Article 39, which would permit an immediate order for cessation of hostilities. I think you will agree that, while this will be new in the experience of the Security Council, it is the only reasonable way in the circumstances.

3\. My immediately following telegram contains text of announcement [2] to be made 4 p.m. today. Would appreciate you giving copy Cutler.
