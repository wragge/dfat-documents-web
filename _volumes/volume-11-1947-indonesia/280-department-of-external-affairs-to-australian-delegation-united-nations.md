# 280 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 472 CANBERRA, 13 August 1947

SECRET

Indonesia.

1\. It is now two weeks since the Security Council made its decision on cessation of hostilities and arbitration. The two parties are no nearer agreement on means of arbitration.

2\. The Security Council must maintain its position and delaying tactics should no longer be permitted.

3\. You should at the next meeting immediately move that the Security Council, noting that there is no agreement by the two parties, should appoint a commission of arbitration and also a commission to observe the carrying out of the cease fire and of the results of arbitration. We would suggest commission[s] of 3 and 5 respectively elected by the Council.
