# 352 Heydon to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 3433 LONDON, 25 September 1947, 3.50 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

Your telegram 4054. [1]

I called on Sjahrir morning of 25th September. He expects to be in London another week during which he will see Attlee and Bevin, to put the Indonesian case in a general way. He hopes to go from here to Australia 'if nothing intervenes'. He promised to let me know early next week his definite movements.

2\. Sjahrir expressed great pleasure at Kirby's appointment, but regret that the Belgian appointee, Van Zeeland should be a 'conservative'. He expressed appreciation of all Australia had done and seemed genuinely anxious to visit Australia.

3\. Dr. Subandrio has established in the last few days an office in London as 'Indonesian representative' and I will keep in touch with him.

4\. Sjahrir is not aware whether Oesman had returned to Indonesia.

I said I had no information, but assumed so, as I had no recent references to him in Australian publications. [2]

_

1 Dispatched on 23 September, it instructed Heydon to ascertain whether Sjahrir (then in London) would be prepared to visit Australia to discuss the work of the Committee of Three.

2 Usman had not returned to Indonesia.
