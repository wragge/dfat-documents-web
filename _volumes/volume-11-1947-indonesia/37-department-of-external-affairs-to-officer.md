# 37 Department of External Affairs to Officer

## Cablegram 44 CANBERRA, 17 April 1947, 5.50 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your 61. [1]

1\. As request for agreement has not been considered, question does not arise.

2\. You will see from our telegrams that we regard seriously the attitude the Dutch have taken on the proposed visit of officials.

Your appeals to meet the Dutch [2] imply to our mind that you do not fully appreciate our feelings in this matter and may not have conveyed them to the Dutch authorities. We had hoped that your previous telegram [3] stating there was no objection to unostentatious visit was a hopeful sign of early agreement. Both the matter of the visit and of the repatriation of Indonesians should be pressed.
