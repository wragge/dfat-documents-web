# 388 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 645 CANBERRA, 24 October 1947, 11.20 a.m.

SECRET

It is reported here by radio that Van Kleffens at the Security Council [1] stated it was impossible to negotiate with Republican Government in [what] he called its present belligerent mood. It is unfair such statements should be made unchallenged by one party to the dispute. This, together with report that Council is allowing tactics of delay which have the effect of nullifying its earlier action. The facts before the Council are the Consular Commission's report which clearly finds Van Kleffens's accusation unfounded and, in fact, the Dutch to be in the belligerent mood. Full warfare is at present going on, and every day's delay makes the situation worse, as the Dutch are allowed to continue their military operations by their untenable interpretation of 'cease fire'. We have only radio reports to go on, and we do not know other local factors, but it would seem to us that Australia should be making a vigorous protest at the way in which the Security Council's decisions are being circumvented.
