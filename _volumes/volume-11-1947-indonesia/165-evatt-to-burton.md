# 165 Evatt to Burton

Cablegram unnumbered (extract) TOKYO [1], 25 July 1947

IMMEDIATE SECRET

(4) Regarding Indonesia, I point out that to make approach only if the United Kingdom do not object is simply to invite such objection and thereby bypassing the only constitutional tribunal that is the Security Council which in relation to international situations has function analogous to the arbitration court in relation to industrial situations and disputes.

1 Evatt arrived in Tokyo on 26 July. This cablegram was in fact dispatched from Kure to Tokyo and thence to Canberra.
