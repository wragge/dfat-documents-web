# 212 Hodgson to Burton

## Cablegram UN707 NEW YORK, 30 July 1947

Reference our conversations Indonesia. [1]

Lange immediately raised the question with me this afternoon whether our resolution would have recommendation for status quo ante i.e. reversion to original perimeters.

I would gather that there might well be an amendment to this effect. Have you given consideration to this and what should our attitude be as probably United Kingdom and United States would oppose?
