## Cablegram 685 SINGAPORE, 6 December 1947, 1.40 p.m.

Doctor Sjahrir leaving Singapore [by] Constellation December 9th.

He has not made any arrangements for his visit to Australia, leaving itinerary etc. to Dr. Oesman. Dr. Sjahrir desires to pay respects to the Prime Minister, Dr. Evatt, Messrs Pollard and Menzies. He wishes to see shipbuilding industry, iron and steel works, food processing factories, meat, fruit, dairy produce. Also wishes to see up to date farms of various types. Would also like, if possible, a recreation visit to Sydney's beaches and mountains.

I have had long discussion with Dr. Sjahrir and given him local Australian picture political, commercial and social as far as practicable.

Dr. Sjahrir is looking forward most eagerly to the visit and is grateful of your assurance of reception. [1] Please inform Dr.
