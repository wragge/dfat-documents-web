# 153 Burton to Ballard

Cablegram 203 CANBERRA, 25 July 1947, 11.15 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 248. [1] Please reply: Australia along with some other Governments has given recognition to de facto authority of Republican Government. [2] Question of diplomatic relations was not determined before hostilities began. Consequently question of formal representation of Republican interests does not arise.

However, in accordance with my Government's previous offer of good offices, which still applies, I would be glad to assist the Republican Government in facilitating negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the present situation.
