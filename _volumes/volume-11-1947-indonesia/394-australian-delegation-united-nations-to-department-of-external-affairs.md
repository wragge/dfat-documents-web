# 394 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN1036 NEW YORK, 27 October 1947, 10.13 p.m.

SECRET

Security 513.

Council considered Indonesia this afternoon.

India and Indonesia, basing their remarks on full consular report, spoke in support of withdrawal of forces to positions ante bellum.

Only other speaker was U.S. who introduced amended version of their resolution (our Security 511 [1]). New resolution deletes words 'directly or indirectly' in paragraph 3, amends paragraph 5 to read-

'Requests the Consular Commission, together with its military assistants, to make its services available to the Committee of Good Offices' [2];

and adds new paragraph-

'Advises the parties concerned, the Committee of Good Offices, and the Consular Commission that its resolution of August 1st should be interpreted as not permitting the use of armed forces of either party by military action to alter substantially the territory under its control on August 4th, 1947.'

The Chairman urged need to reach decision and asked that names of speakers and any amendments or resolutions be submitted on or before the next meeting which has been called for Wednesday.
