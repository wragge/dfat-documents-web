# 327 Officer to Evatt

Cablegram Hague 159 [1] THE HAGUE, 9 September 1947, 1.01 p.m.

IMMEDIATE PERSONAL

Ministry of Foreign Affairs inform me that they expect Mr. Spaak to proceed to New York within the next two or three days and express the hope that you and he will meet and discuss the question of 'the third member of the Committee' of Three, set up by the Security Council. They express strongly the opinion, which seems to me obvious, that the important thing, if the proposal is to succeed, is who the representative of the third country would be, rather than the country, for success or failure will depend on the personal efforts of the man selected.
