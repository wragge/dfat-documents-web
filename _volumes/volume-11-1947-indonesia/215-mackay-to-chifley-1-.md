TOP SECRET

Your telegram 286. [2]

Have conveyed contents to the Government of India and Sjahrir.

Sjahrir is considering paragraph 4 but he has not indicated his intentions.

The Government of India despatched their message to New York for the Security Council at 1300 hours Indian standard time 30th July after waiting an additional hour for your 286 to be deciphered.

The Government of India withholding final comment until they receive the statement mentioned in paragraph 6 [3] but they are hinting non co-operation by Australia in not giving opportunities which India accorded to her. My position is invidious and essential that I be informed of hour of despatch of your instructions for Security Council. Your telegram 288.
