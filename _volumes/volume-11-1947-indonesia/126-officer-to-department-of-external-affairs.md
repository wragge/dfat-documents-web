# 126 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 118 THE HAGUE, 20 July 1947, 8 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET [1]

INDONESIA

The Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for me at 6 p.m. and gave me a copy of a memorandum. This was, I understand, given to Ballard some two hours ago and will be published in whole or in part tonight in broadcasts by Van Mook and Beel. [2]

2\. Shortly Van Mook has been authorised to take 'police measures of a strictly limited character' to create conditions favourable to the implementation of principles of Linggadjati.

3\. The reason given for this step is the disorder and destruction rife in the Republican Territory and the inability of the present Republican Government to give definite undertakings or abide by them.

4\. See my next immediately following telegram. [3]

1 The classification of this cablegram was subsequently downgraded to 'restricted'.
