# 452 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 731 CANBERRA, 5 December 1947, 11.45 a.m.

SECRET

Your U.N. 1191. [1] Indonesia.

1\. You will have received our 728 [2], instructions in which still hold good. We wish to avoid lengthy and possibly acrimonious debate in Security Council at present time. Palar should accordingly be discouraged, from raising question of Linggadjati Agreement or other matters until Dutch attitude on current negotiations becomes clear. You should keep in close touch with United States Delegation and Secretary-General on question of continuance of Committee of Three as at present constituted, and concert with them regarding timing and method of continued Australian membership. We agree that matter of continued Australian participation in Council discussions on Indonesia need not be raised. As regards continued right to vote on Indonesia, you should explore with Secretary-General and other delegations as proposed.

2\. Please advise whether you need urgently any further background beyond that contained in our 1387 to Washington. [3] We are sending by air full account of messages exchanged between us and Batavia and The Hague.
