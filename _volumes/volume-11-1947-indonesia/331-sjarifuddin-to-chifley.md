# 331 Sjarifuddin to Chifley

## Cablegram 312 [1] BATAVIA, 13 September 1947

I have received with deep gratitude favourable and prompt reply [2] to my Communication asking Australia to represent the Republic of Indonesia on the Three Power Commission. I should be most grateful if you would now authorise an Australian representative to visit Djocjacarta earliest in order that I may discuss with him the many points Indonesia wishes to raise with its representative.

We therefore extend to any Australian representative of your nomination a cordial invitation to visit Djocjacarta with the least possible delay. Your assistance in this connection will be greatly appreciated.
