# 340 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN881 NEW YORK, 19 September 1947

SECRET

Security 491.

Indonesia.

1\. In the Security Council on 10th September, Gromyko drew attention to the fact that no information had yet been received from the Consular Commission on the situation in Indonesia. He indicated that if information was not received, 'in the very near future' he would, as President, place the question on the agenda.

United States delegation are anxious that U.S.S.R. should not have material on which to raise criticism of the Consular Commission and have, we understand, stressed to their Consul-General the importance of an early report. We presume you will also have this in mind.

2\. Secretariat have drawn our attention to the fact that Indonesian Government have not yet formally advised the Security Council of their nomination of Australia to the Three Power Committee. Suggest Eaton might take steps to ensure Indonesian Government send formal advice to the Secretary-General or President of the Council.

3\. Belgians have advised that their representative will be Van Zeeland, former Prime Minister of Belgium.

4\. Both Netherlands and Indonesian representatives here have welcomed choice of United States.
