# 213 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN708 NEW YORK, 30 July 1947, 11.25 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Security 419.

Following is text of Indian communication to President of the Security Council today:

'I have the honour on behalf of the Government of India to draw the attention of the Security Council under Article 35(1) of the United Nations Charter to the situation in Indonesia.

During the last few days Dutch Forces have embarked without warning on large scale military action against the Indonesian people. These attacks began without warning at a time when a Delegate of the Indonesian Republican Government was actually at Batavia for negotiations with the Dutch Authorities on the implementation of Linggadjati Agreement.

In the opinion of the Government of India this situation endangers the maintenance of international peace and security which is covered by Article 34 of the Charter. The Government of India therefore requests the Security Council to take the necessary measures provided by the Charter to put an end to the present situation.

The Government of India earnestly hope that in view of its urgency the Council will consider this matter as soon as possible.'
