# 377 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN983 NEW YORK, 15 October 1947

SECRET

Security 507. Your UNY612. [1]

1\. We feel that Interim Consular report [2], the summary of final report [3] and the discussion in the Council show that Council's task is to ensure implementation of cease fire order and that no approval either direct or indirect be given to Dutch demarcation line. Our resolution [4], which had been placed before Council before receipt of your cable, is directed to ensure this by the breaking of immediate contact and by date 1st August avoiding linking present position with Dutch demarcation line.

2\. As Soviet resolution was defeated earlier in Indonesian debate [5] it is unlikely to be approved now. [6]

3\. In event of defeat of our resolution which is likely because of opposition mainly by U.S. and U.K. who are opposed to any withdrawal and of others such as China who question its practicability we intend proposing amendment to U.K.-Belgian resolution [7] for stand fast action along lines of your cable.
