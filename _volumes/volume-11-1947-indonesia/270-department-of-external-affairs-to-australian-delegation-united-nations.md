# 270 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 452 CANBERRA, 10 August 1947, 12.30 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

1\. Indonesian Prime Minister has accepted our proposal. [1]

2\. Position is clear. Dutch have accepted American mediation.

Indonesians have virtually rejected it by requesting good offices be used to secure arbitration. Indonesians have accepted idea of joint American-Australian arbitration.

3\. There is no reasonable alternative and you might consider hav[ing] case put at Washington to support your endeavours at New York. In view of Beasley's telegram [2] and of Indonesian acceptance of our proposal there is no point in pressing idea of three parties.

4\. Minister [3] wants you to be on your guard to restore the authority of the United Nations, at the same time being careful not to risk a public rebuff. The line we are adopting should achieve both objectives.
