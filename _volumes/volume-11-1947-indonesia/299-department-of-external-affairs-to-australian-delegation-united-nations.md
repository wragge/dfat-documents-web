# 299 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram 504 CANBERRA, 25 August 1947, 12.20 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

The fact that Council had already made a decision on 1st August and admitted parties for hearing means matter was regarded then as within jurisdiction and reference to Court at this stage can be interpreted as attempt to circumvent decision of Council on a par with use of the veto.

2 This cablegram was apparently dispatched in response to a United Press report from New York. See also Document 297, paragraph 3.
