# 240 Legge to Burton

## Minute CANBERRA, 5 August 1947

INDONESIAN SITUATION

The following is a transcript dictated by Shortwave Division, Melbourne, this morning:

The Indonesian Radio, Djocjakarta, announced a statement by the Indonesian Prime Minister, directed to the President of the Security Council. It says the Government of the Republic has decided to order cessation of hostilities on Monday night, 24 hours, Indonesian Standard Time. The Government, however, draws the attention of the Council that the decision of the Council was handed to the Republican Government [by] the Dutch Government in Batavia only at 1 o'clock, Indonesian time, on August, 4th. In view of the necessary measures the Government regrets this delay by the Dutch authorities. In carrying out the order for cessation of hostilities, the Security Council should take into consideration the lack of time and the heavy damage to Republican communication lines. Also at the present moment there is no definite line of demarcation clearly separating the Republican from the Dutch forces. The Republican Government thinks that unless the execution of the cessation of hostilities be fully and continuously controlled by ... full[y] neutral parties, there is no guarantee that a 'Cease-Fire' order will not be violated one- sidedly by the Dutch. Therefore the Republican Government strongly urges the sending of a Committee consisting of the representatives of several neutral countries appointed by the Security Council to Indonesia at the earliest possible time. The Government also thinks that the cessation of hostilities should be followed by withdrawal of the Dutch forces at least beyond the line of demarcation fixed on October 14th, 1946. The 'Cease-Fire' order would be given by the Republican Government without reserve. The Prime Minister made it clear that in Indonesian areas where Republican services and officials are functioning, the Republican Government would be fully responsible for peace and order, that in areas where peace and order are endangered, it would take the necessary steps to maintain peace and order, while if the Republican Government be attacked, then would the fight be carried on with all means available. The Prime Minister also declared the Dutch had violated the Linggadjati Agreement and the Republic felt no longer bound by it. What it wanted now was arbitration by an International Committee, and not mediation by a third country.

The actual 'Cease-Fire' order was then issued by President Soekarno. [1] According to the Dutch Radio, should Dutch soldiers still be attacked after the hour of the 'Cease-Fire', Republican fire will be answered, but no counter-measures will be taken.

1 The cease-fire order broadcast by Sukarno on Radio Djokjakarta read as follows: 'I order to all Armed Forces of the Indonesian Republic and Indonesian people in general who are fighting side by side with the Armed Forces, from this moment on to Stand Fast at your respective places and to Cease Hostilities.'
