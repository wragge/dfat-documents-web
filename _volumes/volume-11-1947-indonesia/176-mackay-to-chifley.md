Your telegram 280. [1]

On Sunday morning July 27th informed Sjahrir of Australian views and events in accordance with your telegram. Sjahrir was obviously pleased. His present intention is to remain in India some days and perhaps then go to the United Kingdom but visit to Australia only remote possibility. On July 27th and again today had talks with Sir Girja Bajpai, Secretary-General External Affairs and acquainted him of Australian views.
