# 71 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 84 THE HAGUE, 29 May 1947, 7.40 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Since the return of the Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Territories last Tuesday [1], the Press has been full of reports and conjectures generally that important decisions would be taken immediately. it seems that many who supported the agreement [2] now doubt the sincerity of the Republic in carrying it out.

2\. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon who told me that a note has been given the Republican Government, the text of which will be published tonight. Shortly, it calls on the Republic to implement the agreement in certain constitutional, economic and diplomatic matters, suggests ways in which it can be done and asks for a reply within a fortnight. [3]

3\. Van Boetzelaer told me that both Ministers were pessimistic about the situation in Java and feel that whilst some elements (which he did not name) were obstructing the implementation of the agreement, others, notably Sjahrir, wish to see it implemented, but were not strong enough to break down the obstruction. Both Ministers were optimistic at the situation in East Indonesia, especially Borneo.

4\. I gained the impression that the Government feels that the situation cannot continue in the present state of impasse. The Minister for Foreign Affairs himself seemed depressed. He appeared to hope that the United Kingdom and U.S.A. might try to influence the Republic to a more reasonable outlook.

2 The Linggadjati Agreement.

3 Dated 27 May, the note conveyed a series of proposals by the Commission-General for the implementation of the Linggadjati Agreement. These included proposals for the formation of an interim government for all Indonesia (including representatives of all existing political units) to provide a transitional framework leading to the future federation of the USI; the establishment of an all-Indonesian board for foreign relations; arrangements for military cooperation between Dutch, Republican and other forces in Indonesia including the immediate formation of a joint directorate responsible for internal security, external defence and the reduction of forces; and the establishment of central control boards to oversee foreign trade and exchange, food distribution and the return of confiscated property to its rightful owners. The note further called on the Republic of Indonesia to recognise the States of East Indonesia and West Borneo as equal partners on a federal basis and to cease all activities contrary to such partnership. In the event of a negative or unsatisfactory response, the Commission-General stated that it saw no possibility of continuing discussions and that the question of further action would be referred to the Netherlands Government.
