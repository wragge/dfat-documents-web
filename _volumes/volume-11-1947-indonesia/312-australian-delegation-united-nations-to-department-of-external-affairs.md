# 312 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN817 NEW YORK, 2 September 1947, 1.46 p.m.

SECRET

Security 478.

Your 508. [1] Study of verbatim records all meetings confirms the view that our 787 [2] with texts all resolutions previously given give[s] a complete picture. Most of the meeting was occupied with discussions of a procedural nature and such speeches as were made added little or nothing to what had already been stated. Speeches on Australian-Chinese resolution had already been completed and China refused to withdraw it at that stage just when we were going to vote. Result in our opinion was fortunate as France vetoed Soviet amendment which was in principle same as our original proposal and would have vetoed our resolution which was held in reserve and not withdrawn. As it was we obtained practically all you wished and as much as could be achieved from the Council with its groupings in this case. It seems obvious that press and radio reports must reach you before our telegrams as they are sent in clear and emanate from Lake Success. [3] Our messages can only be prepared at the office [4] after meetings. As it is they keep the present limited Australian diplomatic staff engaged almost every night.
