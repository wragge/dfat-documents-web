# 210 Department of External Affairs to High Commission in London

Cablegram 274 CANBERRA, 31 July 1947

IMMEDIATE SECRET

We do not know how Security Council negotiations will proceed. We hope that they will not last long and that an immediate decision will be given. There might, however, be debate and enquiry under Article 35. Dr. Evatt strongly suggests that the services of Lord Killearn be employed and that, with the United Kingdom Government approval, Australia has the loan of his services as an adviser to Hodgson. [1]

Glad if you would take up matter immediately, as time will be pressing, so that, if this is acceptable, we can arrange for Killearn to go from India to New York straight away.
