# 193 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN702 NEW YORK, 29 July 1947, 7.51 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Security 415.

1\. Your 399 [1] and 400. [2] We have been unable to ascertain the form in which India is raising the matter. Indian Representatives here have not yet received any instructions either as to form and substance. The only clue we have is U.P. [3] despatch from London 23rd July that India would 'ask the Security Council to consider the disturbances in Indonesia as a breach of the Peace'.

2\. Meanwhile we propose to have ready a letter to the President of the Security Council in the following form.

[matter omitted] [4]

3\. Your 400 Paragraph 5. It is most desirable that the Government of Republic of Indonesia should have authorised Representatives in New York who can accept immediately conditions laid down by the Council under Article 32 [5] and who could participate in Council discussion. If the Indonesian Representative was not available or Indonesian Government delayed acceptance of the Council's conditions it might be prejudicial to speedy hearing of the case which is of paramount importance on the basis of our submission.

We presume conditions will be similar to those laid down for Bulgaria and Albania in Balkans case. If India takes initial or concurrent action, whatever its basis, Indian Representative will probably be invited to participate following precedent of Ukraine in previous Indonesian case. [6]

1 Dispatched on 29 July, it asked the Delegation to ascertain the form in which India intended to refer the Indonesian question to the Security Council.

4 The text of the letter is given in Document 196.

5 Under Article 32 of the United Nations Charter, any member of the United Nations which is not a member of the Security Council or any state which is not a member of the United Nations, if it is a party to a dispute under consideration by the Council, may be invited to participate, without vote, in discussion relating to the dispute. The Security Council may lay down such conditions as it deems just for the participation of a state which is not a member of the United Nations.
