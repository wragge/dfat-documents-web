# 218 Watt to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 245 MOSCOW, 31 July 1947, 11.28 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your telegram 138. [1] INDONESIA.

1\. First four paragraphs of the Prime Minister's statement [2] (ending with restoration of peace) was published in Pravda today.

2\. Today I had informal talk with Yerofeev, head of the second European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed the matter set out in the Prime Minister's statement and expressed the hope that the Soviet Government would give full support in the Security Council to the Australian initiative. He was fully aware that the statement had been made but would not indicate disapproval of developments in Indonesia; he merely said that the Australian proposals would receive fullest consideration by the Soviet Government.
