# 474 Burton to Hood

Cablegram 753 CANBERRA, 17 December 1947

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Reports from Indonesia suggest Dutch are massing troops at strategic points. [1] There is no objection to you stating this as a report, and the statement which we have telegraphed to you [2] should be made in the context of a firm statement requesting immediate action and the termination of the delaying tactics which have now prolonged negotiations for almost three months since the Security Council took its decision. This will be the last opportunity we will have on the Security Council of making an issue of this matter.
