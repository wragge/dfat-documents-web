# 363 Department of External Affairs to Eaton

Cablegram 290 CANBERRA, 3 October 1947, 4.40 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

You will have heard that Dr. Frank Graham has been appointed American representative on Committee of Three. This removes one reason adduced by American and Belgian Consuls against need for speed in completing report. [1] The fact that American officers are not attached to Consular Commission and that joint military report was not asked for by Security Council and many cases need not await their conclusions should also be used to resist further delay.
