# 86 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hague 92 THE HAGUE, 16 June 1947, 6.10 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Indonesia.

My immediately preceding telegram 91. [1] I think the situation is grave and that we may find ourselves faced at short notice by a Dutch decision to use force. I fear Van Mook has been persuaded finally by the military and reactionaries and has persuaded the Commission-General and the Government.

2\. The British Ambassador has talked already on instructions very emphatically to the Minister for Foreign Affairs [2], but I think the Foreign Office should emphasize once again to the Netherlands Ambassador that there must not be recourse to force until every other effort has been tried and failed, and that 'provocation' will not condone the use of force. And I think a fresh effort should be made at Batavia to bring home to the Indonesians the seriousness of the position and that they must be ready to co- operate and negotiate in a proper spirit quickly if it is to be avoided.
