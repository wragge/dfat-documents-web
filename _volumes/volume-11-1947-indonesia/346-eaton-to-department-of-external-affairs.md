# 346 Eaton to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 323 BATAVIA, 23 September 1947, 12.35 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

E.13. Your telegram 275. [1]

In view of the despatch of the Consular Mission telegram to the Security Council [2], suggest consideration be given that question be raised by the Australian member of the Council for immediate formation of joint Dutch-Indonesian Police force to take over responsibilities of law and order in areas occupied by the Dutch from tonight, prior to Dutch withdrawal. Formation to be under guidance and/or supervised by Military officers attached to the Consular Mission. Grave dangers to the population if the Dutch withdrew without some such measures.

2\. It must be understood that except for the Australian efforts and United Kingdom and French colleagues accompanying me, very little has been done by other members to date. This also applies to Military observers. No other observers yet in the field, but two French, two Belgian officers being placed today. American observers not yet arrived. Arrangements previously made for return of all Australian observers who would be in Batavia today for discussions and move to other areas. Probably will now arrange for one to return to Canberra.

3\. In view of the foregoing consider that the Consular Mission would not yet be prepared to agree, at least at the present juncture, to forward any recommendation to the Security Council as outlined in paragraph one.

4\. Essential I should remain in Batavia for few days before proceeding to Djokjakarta and am in constant touch with Gani but until the Dutch give approval as suggested by you, will not make any approach regarding the Republic representative visit to Australia which obviously will be accepted.

5\. Consider it advisable for Consul or Vice-Consul to be posted to the staff. Will be essential in the near future.
