# 185 Mackay to Chifley

Cablegram 399 NEW DELHI, 29 July 1947, 4.55 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your telegram 282. [1]

Have had talks with Nehru and Bajpai together. The Indian External Affairs have prepared a message to be despatched in clear to the Chairman of the Security Council but following my representations to permit your comments Nehru has agreed to withhold sending this communication till 12 noon Indian standard time on Wednesday 30th July. The Indian message does not contain suggestions regarding specific recommendation to be made by the Security Council but draws attention under Article 35(1) [2] of the United Nations Charter to the situation in Indonesia and refers to attacks without warning by Dutch forces on Indonesian people. Message continues that in the opinion of the Government of India this situation endangers the maintenance of international peace and security which is covered by Article 34 of the Charter. The Government of India therefore requests the Security Council to take necessary measures provided by the Charter to put an end to the present situation.
