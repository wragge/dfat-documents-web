# 308 Department of External Affairs to Eaton

Cablegram 252 CANBERRA, 1 September 1947, 5.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 294. [1]

We agree with United States-United Kingdom interpretation that investigation should be both individual and joint. You should offer to take both with you to Djokjakarta, but in any case endeavour to obtain their agreement that there must be no attempt by either Dutch or Indonesians to control investigations or the movements of the Consuls. You must use your discretion, but will realise the importance of obtaining a detailed list of allegations from Dutch sources and then proceeding to the Indonesian headquarters to obtain a similar list from there. This must be regarded by United States-United Kingdom representatives as a proper procedure. Delay will be most unfortunate and you may have to move without them if they are depending upon instructions which may take some days to reach them.
