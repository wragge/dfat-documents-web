# 431 Burton to Kirby

Cablegram 362 CANBFRRA, 22 November 1947, 3.05 p.m.

TOP SECRET PERSONAL

After discussion with Prime Minister I feel I should tell you that he is strongly of opinion that discussions on cease fire cannot be allowed to drag on. He feels that the Committee should announce to both parties a time limit of say one week or so and that if no solution has been reached by that time Committee should report matter back to Security Council.

2\. You will now have received Dr. Evatt's interpretation of 1st November resolution [1], which should assist in bringing pressure on the Dutch under threat that reference back to Security Council will show them clearly in the wrong.
