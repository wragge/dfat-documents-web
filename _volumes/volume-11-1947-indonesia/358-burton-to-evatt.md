# 358 Burton to Evatt

Cablegram E42 CANBERRA, 30 September 1947

IMMEDIATE PERSONAL

Indonesia.

1\. Delay is occasioning concern. Eaton reports Belgian Consul- General endeavouring to delay final report to the Security Council which Eaton hopes will be completed by 3rd October. American officers have delayed in arriving. American Government has delayed appointment of member of Committee of Three.

2\. Now Eaton reports 'mopping up' operations within the Van Mook Line are to be intensified, and Officer reports that solution aimed at is independence for Republic in area they control and Dutch administration for the rest.

3\. It would seem therefore that delay by Americans and Belgians is part of a plan to enable Dutch to determine the final outcome. If they succeed, it would make a farce of all Australia has done and a farce also of the one United Nations action which has been effective.

4\. Any further delay and we will have to find a substitute for Kirby. We have waited patiently now for five weeks for the Committee to come into operation. I think there should be some public comment if there is not an immediate move made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene the Committee of Three. The setting up of the Committee with America as Chairman has had the effect of taking the initiative right out of our hands unless we are prepared ourselves to convene the Committee. We have to wait on them. I would expect critical comment from even supporters in Australia if we do not follow this matter through and get the Committee meeting and get some final recommendations in the immediate future. Glad of your advice as to course to be taken.
