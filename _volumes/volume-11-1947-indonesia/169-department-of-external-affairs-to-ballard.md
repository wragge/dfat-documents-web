# 169 Department of External Affairs to Ballard

Cablegram 206 CANBERRA, 26 July 1947, 12.20 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 249. [1]

Dutch objection to second sentence in which we state question of diplomatic relations was not determined is hard to understand, as we deliberately adopted this line so as not to offend Dutch.

Jenkins has apparently already reported, as your instructions appear in all papers. Radio Australia will be asked to send message in the form of a report of what is understood to be the case based on press reports. Shortwave [2] is monitoring all messages and it may be that we will have to develop this means of communication in anticipation of mediation moves.
