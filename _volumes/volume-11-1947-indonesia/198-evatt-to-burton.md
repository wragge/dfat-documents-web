# 198 Evatt to Burton

Cablegram Dept 245 (extract) TOKYO, 30 July 1947, 9.45 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET PERSONAL

1\. Many thanks for wires regarding Indonesia. I am sure that positive action by Australia will be of lasting benefit. Regarding the Security Council would strongly suggest that Killearn be sent to New York to advise Hodgson and that United Kingdom be asked for loan of his services.
