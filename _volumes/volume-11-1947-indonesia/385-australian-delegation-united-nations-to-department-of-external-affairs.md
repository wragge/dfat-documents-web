Your UNY637 [1], no vote yet taken.

Council continued discussion on Indonesia today. Final Consular report without annexes distributed at meeting. Annexes not available till the end of the week. Philippines proposed that M.S.C. [2] should assist in securing implementation of cease fire order. United States spoke in support of their resolution, our Security 509. [3]

Netherlands delivered long address on familiar lines justifying their position and asserting it was not possible to observe cease fire order literally. Steps were necessary to protect civilian Chinese etc. Criticised United States resolution as being too theoretical and suggested deletion of section calling for cessation of 'activities which directly or indirectly contravene' the cease fire order.

Soviet criticised Consular report as being outside terms of reference of Commission and not objective. Asserted Council should take action to secure cessation of hostilities and appealed for support for Soviet resolution. [4]

Chairman then suggested adjournment of meeting till Monday to enable study of full Consular report and annexes.

Soviet Union, Australia and Colombia all urged for meeting to be held this week arguing that full report was sufficient for decision on cessation of hostilities. Proposal to hold meeting this week received only five votes. Next meeting to be held Monday.
