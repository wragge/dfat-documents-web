# 389 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN1023 NEW YORK, 24 October 1947, 11.29 a.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Security 512.

We have repeatedly opposed delaying tactics in Council and urged expeditious handling of Indonesian question.

At last meeting we spoke strongly against United Kingdom proposal for meeting next week, but as indicated in last paragraph our Security 510 [1] proposal for earlier meeting received only five votes namely Australia, Colombia, Poland, Soviet Union and Syria.

We agree with your remarks on Consular Report [2], but Dutch are receiving strong support in Council from Belgium and France while United States, United Kingdom and Brazil are opposed to any withdrawal of forces.
