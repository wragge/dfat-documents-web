# 136 Department of External Affairs to Beasley

Cablegram 256 CANBERRA, 22 July 1947, 2.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your 219. [1]

Please see our No.187 to Secretary of State. [2] We can do no more now than watch position and not miss opportunity to assist in solution. Public offer by United Kingdom, in which we should be associated, of Killearn's services would seem next step. Our association with any mediation move is essential.
