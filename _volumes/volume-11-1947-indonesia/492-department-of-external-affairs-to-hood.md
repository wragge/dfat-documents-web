# 492 Department of External Affairs to Hood

Cablegram 770 CANBERRA, 29 December 1947

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Indonesia. Our 767. [1]

There now appears to be no chance that summary of Good Offices Committee report will be telegraphed to the Security Council in time for the next meeting. The present position, according to Critchley, is that report has been completed and is being forwarded immediately and that Committee's agreed proposals are now under consideration by both parties. In the circumstances there appears to be little that Council can usefully do on Indonesia at this juncture.

1 Dispatched on 27 December, it conveyed a summary of Document 488.
