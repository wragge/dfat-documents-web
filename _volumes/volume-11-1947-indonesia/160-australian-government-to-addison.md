1\. British Minister at Washington has advised Australian Ambassador that United States reaction to proposal was definitely discouraging on the. grounds that joint intervention to secure truce or joint offer of arbitration would be unacceptable to Dutch and, in fact, Dutch had already advised State Department that they would resent either action.

It should be emphasised in this connection that greatest caution will be taken by us to draw attention to matter in objective way seeking quasi-judicial settlement and appointment of Commission of Enquiry and avoiding unnecessary accusations and counter accusations. Mr. Beasley will have already pointed out that such action by us is consistent with the attitude we have always adopted in matters raised in the Security Council.
