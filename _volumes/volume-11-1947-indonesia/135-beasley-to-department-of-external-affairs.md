# 135 Beasley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 219 LONDON, 21 July 1947, 2.22 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your telegram 255 [1], Dominions Office telegram 148. [2]

1 discussed this matter with Addison on 16th July and asked him for an opportunity of discussing it with him and Bevin as soon as possible. In talking to Addison I mentioned specifically your anxiety that Killearn's services should be used and stressed our deep concern that the concessions should not come from one side.

2\. At the High Commissioner's meeting 18th July in view of the reports in London papers on Indonesian situation, I asked whether there was any late news from Indonesia and Addison and McNeil referred in the course of their reply briefly and in guarded terms to your telegram 181. [3] Both insisted that Bevin had taken a strong stand with the Dutch from time to time and McNeil was obviously upset at any prospect of matter being raised in Security Council which he said would probably remove any possibility of getting real agreement between Dutch and Indonesians and would promote Soviet intervention.

3\. Have you any further instructions in view of the new situation?
