ROC/PRC Representation in International Bodies

Our AP.144.[1](#f1)

Ministers have now agreed that Australian attitude to ROC/PRC representation on international bodies should be as follows:—

(a) So far as subsidiary organs of UN are concerned, General Assembly vote can be regarded as binding and PRC should automatically take its place.

(b) Each specialized agency has the right to take its own decision.

(c) Decisions by agency should be taken by proper constitutional body in accordance with correct procedures.

(d) While point (c) should be made we would not insist upon it.

(e) Australia will abstain on decisions whether they are made in proper constitutional bodies or in bodies not regarded as appropriate.

2\. The above guidelines are subject to the qualification that in cases which may be regarded as a special situation, or where Australia is seen to have a special interest, such as the IMF, IBRD or the International Sugar Agreement, reference should be made to Canberra for separate instructions. (For example the Australian delegation to the current meeting of the International Sugar Council has been instructed to do what it can to keep the ROC a party to the agreement.)
