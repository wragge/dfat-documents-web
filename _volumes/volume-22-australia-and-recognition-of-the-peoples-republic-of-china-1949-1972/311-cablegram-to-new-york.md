For Mcintyre

China

Your UN143.[1](#f1)

It was not our intention that Merillees should raise in any way with the Chinese Mission the question of pursuing the dialogue. It was desired only to ascertain whether the Chinese Mission had said anything to James Kibel of which the Australian Government should be aware and to make it clear that in that event we would want to deal directly with the Chinese and not through third parties. In accordance with our firm understanding that the dialogue should be pursued in Paris, we are instructing Renouf to seek an early appointment with the PRC Ambassador there to put some new points to him.

2\. Merrillees should see Chou immediately to put these points clearly and to emphasise that we are not proposing a resumption of the dialogue in New York.
