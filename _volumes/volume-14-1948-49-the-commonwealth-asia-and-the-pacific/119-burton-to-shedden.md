# 119 Burton to Shedden

Memorandum CANBERRA, 19 September 1949

SECRET DEFENCE CO-OPERATION WITH INDIA AND PAKISTAN

Since the cessation of hostilities in Kashmir Australia, as you are aware, has extended certain measures of defence co-operation to India and Pakistan. Hitherto it has been our intention that the Government of each of these countries should be informed of any defence assistance accorded to the other. It has now been decided, however, that the time has come when this practice, which was adopted for the transitional period immediately following the transfer of power in India, may be discontinued. In future, therefore, action taken on any request for defence cooperation received from India or Pakistan will not be notified automatically to the other Government.

Notwithstanding this decision, it is of course considered important that every effort should be made to ensure that, as far as possible, identical treatment is given to Pakistan and India in relation to matters of defence co-operation. [1]
