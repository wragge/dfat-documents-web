# 64 Burton to Evatt

Cablegram E96 CANBERRA, 18 November 1948, 9.45 a.m.

TOP SECRET

After perusal of cables regarding Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference [1] and subsequent messages on Commonwealth relations, I feel that we may tend to overlook importance of Pakistan. So long as Pakistan remains a member of the Commonwealth I think Indian decision completely to sever links with Commonwealth unlikely. There are more solid reasons for Pakistan to continue in Commonwealth than for India but we should avoid creating the impression amongst Pakistan leaders that we are courting India and ignoring them.

Assurance of good relations with Pakistan and Pakistan's continuance in Commonwealth should completely round off successes you have already achieved in relation to Indian leaders.
