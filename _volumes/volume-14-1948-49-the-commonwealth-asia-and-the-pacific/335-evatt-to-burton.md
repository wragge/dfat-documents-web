# 335 Evatt to Burton

Cablegram E11 LONDON, 16 August 1948, 1.08 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL AND SECRET

JAPAN

At special request of United Kingdom Government after discussion with Beven I have sent most immediate telegram to Shaw as follows:-

Begins-United Kingdom Government is most anxious that you should not, at present, bring up matter regarding Civil Service disputes at Allied Council. Embarrassment with United States Government on other matters would be considerable. I agree with this view and you should hold your hand until you get further instructions.

Ends.

2\. Please confirm these instructions to Shaw immediately.

3\. It must be remembered that Australia has not a separate vote and therefore it would be impossible for Shaw to speak for Australia only. Will speak to you later regarding this matter.
