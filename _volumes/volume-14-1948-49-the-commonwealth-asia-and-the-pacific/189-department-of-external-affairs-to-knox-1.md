Cablegram 19 CANBERRA, 11 March 1948, 4.50 p.m.

Your B.36.

You should not give any formal acknowledgement of the note at this stage. The Government in power came to power by force and, though there have been certain acts since to assert popular support, this is not sufficient evidence on which we should base any decision of recognition. The only test is whether Siam fulfils conditions of membership of the United Nations and there is no mention of this in Foreign Minister's note. While you should not make any formal communication to Siam Government, you are free to explain our attitude to other foreign representatives and seek their concurrence, meanwhile requesting them not to acknowledge note.
