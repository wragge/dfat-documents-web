# 235 Department of External Affairs to Officer

Cablegram 19 CANBERRA, 29 January 1949, 12 noon

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your 44. [1]

Minister wishes to thank you for your message. Whatever you might do along those lines would be appropriate, but he feels he cannot take such action without first consulting the Secretary-General.

At the appropriate time, he thinks the move would be a good one.

Meanwhile, question of sending an officer with the Government when it moves should not be finally determined as it does involve, as you pointed out, unusual difficulties on recognition.
