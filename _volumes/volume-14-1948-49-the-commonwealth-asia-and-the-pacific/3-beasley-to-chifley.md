# 3 Beasley to Chifley

Cablegram 39 LONDON, 13 February 1948, 5.50 p.m.

SECRET

At meeting at Commonwealth Relations Office 13th February High Commissioners requested that Chancellor of Exchequer should take early opportunity reviewing present balance of payments question in particular with view to giving atmosphere for likely future developments to High Commissioners. I made suggestion because I felt that as result of announcements last week and their effect on stock exchanges and opinion it was important to have such discussion with Cripps to supplement statistical work being done by Sterling Area Committee. Would appreciate your telegraphing any lines of enquiry you would like pursued with Cripps.
