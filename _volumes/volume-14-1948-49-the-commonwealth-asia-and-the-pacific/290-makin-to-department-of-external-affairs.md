In brief it emphasises importance of achieving a self- supporting economy in Japan as soon as possible. Japanese Government and people, FEC [1] and SCAP [2] should take all possible and necessary steps to bring this about. Serves notice that proposal will shortly be introduced into Congress to provide funds for Fiscal year 1949 not only for subsistence items but also for procurement of such imports as industrial raw materials and spare parts to assist Japan to expand output of peaceful industries towards status of self-support.
