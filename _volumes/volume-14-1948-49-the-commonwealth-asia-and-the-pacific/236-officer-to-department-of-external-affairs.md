# 236 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 49 NANKING, 29 January 1949, 9.45 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your telegram 19. [1]

I appreciate that Secretary-General must be consulted but hope it can be done quickly for time is short and I believe a very early statement on lines suggested in my telegram 44 might tip the balance.

2\. I am doing what I can here to emphasize that we are staying with Acting President to try and help him to negotiate a settlement.

3\. I do not think sending of a Liaison Officer to Canton affects the position. It is doing no more than maintaining contact with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he can be withdrawn at any moment.
