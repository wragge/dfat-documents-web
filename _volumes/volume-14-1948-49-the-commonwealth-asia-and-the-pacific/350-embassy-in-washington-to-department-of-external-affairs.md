Cablegram 363 WASHINGTON, 20 April 1949, 8.11 p.m.

RESTRICTED

F.E.C. 73.

Japanese participation in International Relations.

State Department advised us today that United States representative will introduce following proposal [1] into F.E.C.

tomorrow:-

In view of the fact that one of the basic objectives of the occupation of Japan is to encourage the development in the open of respect for the rights of other nations, and to facilitate a progressive resumption by Japan of its normal international responsibilities:

The Far Eastern Commission decides as a matter of policy that the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, subject to his discretion and continued control, should permit Japan to participate with other Nations or groups of Nations in such International relations, conventions, meetings, consular arrangements or other bilateral or multilateral accords as Japan may be invited to enter into, accede to, attend or participate in and that the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers shall consider to be in the interests of the occupation.

You will see that this proposal has implications of a far reaching nature. We are bringing it to the attention of the Minister. [2]
