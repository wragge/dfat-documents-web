Japanese participation in International Relations.

The Minister agrees that the United States proposal is undesirable and should be strongly opposed. The question of Japanese Foreign Relations is a matter for all countries who contributed to the Pacific victory, i.e., for the F.E.C. No basic change should be made until the peace treaty is signed and the opportunity should be taken to stress the need for early treaty. [2]
