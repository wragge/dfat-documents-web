# 244 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 71 NANKING, 14 February 1949, 5.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

My telegram No.64 [1] and my immediately preceding telegram 70.

[2] Acting President to express is being very reticent about any action by [United Nations]. [3] He is fearful of any more which might prejudice his efforts to open negotiations on which he will make a broadcast speech to-night. He wishes probably to know ([possibly] from the Yen Mission) the attitude of the Communists.

2\. Sun Fo on the contrary has come out with fill support of your proposal (which is in line with his earlier attempt to secure the good offices of the big four). I fear his main object is to try and put the Communists in the wrong and that the only result may be to embarrass the Acting President.

_

1 Dispatched 21 February 1949, it reported that immediate contact with the Acting President was possible but contact with the Communists would be slow and indirect.

2 Dispatched 14 February 1949, it reported the return of the Nanking unofficial peace delegation who gave the impression that the Communists intended to suggest opening negotiations within a month.
