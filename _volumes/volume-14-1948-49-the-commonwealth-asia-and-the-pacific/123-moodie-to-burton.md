# 123 Moodie to Burton

## Note CANBERRA, 24 November 1948

The attached papers [1] were discussed at J.I.C. meeting today.

[2] You'll see that there are many things quite out of line with us.

Apart from a few amendments the C'ttee all agreed to the paper.

I have made it clear that I'm not in a position to endorse it.

See paras 7-15 &amp; 18-23. [3] The amended report will be sent up in a day or two. Miss Wilson can show you if you want. [4]

_

1 Joint Intelligence Committee report 66/1948 which was the draft version of Document 122.

2 Moodie was External Affairs representative on the Joint Intelligence Committee.

3 paragraphs 18-23 in the draft correspond to paragraphs 37-43 in Document 122.

4 Burton annotated the note: 'We have given our apprec[iation] [Document 121]: you should not take pan in discussion on absurd document such as this.'
