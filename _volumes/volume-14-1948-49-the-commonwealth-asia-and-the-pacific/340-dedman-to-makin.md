# 340 Dedman to Makin

Cablegram 445 CANBERRA, 7 May 1948

SECRET

It is desired that a communication in the following terms be sent to the United States Government immediately:

'The Australian Government has reviewed the position of its contingent of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.

As demilitarisation tasks in the B.C.O.F. area have been completed, and in view of the settled conditions in Japan, the Government proposes to reduce the Australian contingent to one Army battalion and one Air Force squadron with the necessary administrative units for their maintenance, of an approximate overall strength of 2,750. The reduction would take place in progressive stages and be completed by or shortly after 31st December, 1948. In accordance with paragraph 3 (b) of the MacArthur-Northcott agreement [1] the foregoing proposals of the Australian Government are submitted for the agreement of the United States Government.' [2]
