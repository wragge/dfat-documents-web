# 280 Department of External Affairs to Mighell

Cablegram 4988 CANBERRA, 17 November 1949, 11.25 a.m.

SECRET

Your 4782. [1]

Paragraph II: Does this mean that United Kingdom contemplate that they could recognise Communist Government but at the same time oppose or abstain on the question of accreditation of Chinese Communist representative in Security Council. Since this would mean the continuation of representation by Chinese Nationalists argument is hard to follow. [2]

1 Document 279 2 Mighell replied in cablegram 4819, dispatched 17 November, that Bevin had said that when United Kingdom recognised the Communist Government it would have to vote 'for the representative of the Communist Government taking the Chinese place as a permanent member of the Security Council'.
