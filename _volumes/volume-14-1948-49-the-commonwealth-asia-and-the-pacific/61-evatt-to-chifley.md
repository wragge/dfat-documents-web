PERSONAL TOP SECRET

BROOK'S VISIT. [1] Noel-Baker discussed with me new and tentative suggestions as to future relationships of British Nations which have been put forward mainly by India and under which status of the King would be altered in important respects. I informed him of past occasions when you and I were consulted without our views being at all accepted and pointed out possibility of serious local political implications. I further suggested that Indian legal and constitutional views on British Commonwealth of Nations would need most careful consideration before we could pronounce on them.

Therefore suggest you might tell Brook that position can be discussed with me here without commitment by Australia. Best Wishes.
