# 239 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 53 NANKING, 2 February 1949, 6.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

My immediately preceding telegram 52 [1] and your telegram 20. [2] I think it would be wise to do no more than make a statement at present and reserve the question of Good Offices for the present.

2\. Having discussed the matter with the Acting President, I am seeking now the means of contact with the communists, but do not expect to be able to do more than get to them a copy of what I sent this morning to the Acting President.

3\. If there are difficulties in making the statement in any other way, could you do it when the House meets on the 9th and arrange for special emphasis to it in broadcasts from Australia. If I could have the text as early as possible I would endeavour to get copies to the communists.
