LONG RANGE WEAPONS PROJECT

Memorandum of Arrangements Between Australian and U.K. Governments to Govern the Operation of the Long Range Weapons Project

[matter omitted]

2\. OBJECT OF THE PROJECT It is agreed that the object of the project is to set up and operate, as a Joint United Kingdom/Australian undertaking, an experimental range and supporting establishments for the testing and development of guided weapons, pilotless aircraft and other air launched equipment, including radio and radar control and counter measures.

3\. FACILITIES TO BE PROVIDED (a) It is agreed that, subject to such financial arrangements as may be accepted by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments, the following facilities are to be provided in Australia:-

(i) Range and associated facilities: Initially, all works and services essential to the implementation of the project, required at the range head and along the first 300 miles of the range, including those required for the initial assessment of experimental observations. The length of the range will be extended as agreed as necessary to allow for the testing of the various weapons to be developed.

(ii) Developmental facilities: A technical establishment to provide facilities for assembly, testing, repair and modification of weapons to be tested on the range.

(iii) Production capacity: Production capacity in Government factories or civil firms as may be required from time to time for the manufacture of prototypes or component parts of the various weapons to be tested and for the manufacture of range equipment.

(b) It is agreed that, subject to such financial arrangements as may be accepted by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments, the following are to be provided by the United Kingdom:-

(i) Technical equipment not available in Australia:

As far as possible, Australian sources of supply will be used to provide all equipment required for installation in connection with the project, but it is probable, particularly in the early stages, that special technical equipment will have to be provided from sources other than Australia. Such provision will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom.

(ii) Other facilities required in connection with the range in Australia:

The United Kingdom Government will, for its part, maintain such facilities in the United Kingdom as are complementary to the satisfactory operation of the range and its supporting establishments in Australia.

4\. CONTROL OF THE PROJECT It is agreed that the authorities responsible for the control of the project shall be those as indicated in the Functional Table of Organisation, as at Appendix I [5] hereto, the various channels of communication being those as shown:-

(a) Governmental level:

Agreement having been reached on the object of the project as between the United Kingdom and Australian Governments, major diversions from the Agreement will be referred for governmental decision, but, apart from these, the authorities as enumerated in the succeeding sub-paragraphs will, on their respective levels, control the various phases of the implementation of the project.

(b) Combined (U.K./Australian) Long Range Weapons Committee, London:

It is agreed that a Committee of United Kingdom and Australian representatives shall be set up in London to consider matters of joint concern and to advise the responsible Departments, through their respective representatives.

For the Australian part, representation on the Committee shall consist of a representative of the Department of Defence, a representative of the Department of Supply and Development, and a member of the High Commissioner's staff representing the Commonwealth Treasury. The representative of the Department of Defence will co-opt technical staff officers representing Navy, Army and Air, as necessary. The Australian representatives will communicate all proposals arising out of the discussions undertaken by the Committee to the Department of Defence, other than technical matters requiring joint consideration, which will be communicated to the Department of Supply and Development.

The authorities responsible for initiating trials and the channels to be used for such purposes are as indicated in Appendix I.

Scientific, technical and Service personnel will be employed, as appropriate, in connection with the project. It is further agreed that the Ministry of Supply will accept staff with suitable qualifications, employed or recruited by the Australian Government, for training in the United Kingdom with a view to their ultimate employment on the project in Australia.

6\. DISTRIBUTION OF DATA It is agreed that all data compiled as the result of trials undertaken on the range, or research into, and the development of, particular weapons is the joint property of the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. Further, in view of the secrecy associated with the project, such data as may be compiled shall be made available only to properly authorised persons, the security considerations enforced being jointly agreed to by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments and applying equally to both Governments.

7\. PRODUCTION RIGHTS (a) It is agreed that all information relating to production technique, etc., is the joint property of the United Kingdom and Australian Governments, and that either or both Governments shall have full right, so far as the respective Governments are in a position to convey such right, of producing to meet their particular requirements any weapons which may be developed as a result of the operation of the project.
