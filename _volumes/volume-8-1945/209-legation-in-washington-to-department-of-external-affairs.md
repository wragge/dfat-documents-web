# 209 Legation in Washington to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 732 WASHINGTON, 21 August 1945, 9.12 p.m.

SECRET

LEND LEASE.

The President has announced that Lend Lease supplies will be stopped immediately.

The United Kingdom is protesting and interpretations of the statement are now being discussed. We shall report further as soon as possible.

At present it seems that Foreign Economic Administration only is involved and not supplies transferred from Military sources.
