Control of Japan exercised by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers is effected by the issue of directives to the Japanese or the appropriate agency thereof by the Supreme Commander through the Japanese Central Liaison Office at Tokyo, or Yokohama Liaison Office. Those Liaison Offices are, it is understood, staffed by personnel from the Foreign Office. Where action ordered by the directive is not [1] by the Japanese authorities further instructions to comply have on occasion been issued and in the last resort appropriate action is taken by the Army authorities.

2\. The Supreme Commander is advised in several spheres of activity by special sections of G.H.Q. which have been set up by General Orders and are as follows- (1) Civil intelligence.

subordinate Government agencies and business; recommendations for demilitarization, decentralization, elimination of feudal and totalitarian authority and elimination of relationships between military [4] and business [5] continue Japanese war potential.

[3.] A set of directives so far issued to the Japanese Government follows by bag and these documents, with the above mentioned General Orders, are of basic importance. The general sense of some of the more important of them is summarized in my immediately following telegram. [6]

4\. A detailed examination of the directives will enable you to form an opinion as to how far they coincide with Australian objectives, but of course much depends on how far they are carried out, supervised and policed. MacDermott, Foreign Office Liaison Officer, considers that the Americans have done 'an incredibly good job-just as we would have done it ourselves'.

The Canadian Liaison Officer Norman agrees substantially with this view but points out that the Japanese Government while conforming with instructions does not do more than it has to. This attitude he attributes not only to a certain amount of inertia and absence of a cooperative spirit but also to a certain grogginess resulting from blows which some of the directives have dealt.

The abovementioned (small portion omitted in transmission) weeding out of obnoxious personnel. Norman says that attention is now being given to this.

6\. Norman also considers that G.H.Q. is hampered in giving effect to directives by a generally insufficient staff and in particular by a lack of expert staff. For example, detailed reports furnished by the Japanese Government on instructions cannot be examined and considered here for this reason.

7\. In spite of price fixing there is a black market in food of which there is a great shortage; press reports state that this year rice crop will be 20 per cent less than last year and the lowest for 36 years. Norman considers that the country growers will be disposed to hoard their crops owing to lack of goods on which to spend the price.

8\. The main general impression drawn from my four days observation of Tokyo is of orderliness; lack of interest either way in foreigners shown by the people in the streets who are uniformly shabby and a few appear [7] attempting to carrying out normal daily routines so far as conditions allow.
