Cablegram 231 CANBERRA, 12 August 1945

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your telegram 289. [1]

In view of terms of message to the Japanese Government [2] and of the Potsdam declaration [3], we take it that culpability and trial of the Emperor for war crimes will remain a question for determination by the Allied authorities subsequent to surrender.

We would be glad of your confirmation of this as a matter of urgency.
