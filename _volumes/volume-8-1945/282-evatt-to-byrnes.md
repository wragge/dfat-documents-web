# 282 Evatt to Byrnes

## Letter LONDON, 1 October 1945

I sincerely hope that you will agree to the Far Eastern Commission having its headquarters at Washington and not at Tokyo. The personnel available at Washington will be better. Moreover, at Washington it would be possible for matters of non-military policy to be discussed with yourself and handled far more satisfactorily from a political point of view than would be the case if the Commission sat at Tokyo.

A great deal depends upon the spirit in which the initial working out of the Japanese settlement is approached. This, in my opinion, would be better at Washington, away from military and operational matters than it would be at Tokyo.

This suggestion would not preclude the Commission having a subordinate agency or committee working in Tokyo.
