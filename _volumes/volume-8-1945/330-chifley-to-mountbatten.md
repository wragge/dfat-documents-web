MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

The Australian Minister for Immigration stresses that he undertook that the Indonesians would be landed at ports of their choice, namely, at Sourabaya. and Medan. He has strongly represented to me that the landings should be permitted at those ports especially at Sourabaya.
