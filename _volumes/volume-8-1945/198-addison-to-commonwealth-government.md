# 198 Addison to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 303 LONDON, 17 August 1945, 5.10 p.m.

TOP SECRET IMMEDIATE

Your telegram of 12th August No. 231. [1]

Statements in question do not in themselves prejudice question of the treatment to be given to Emperor Hirohito, which will be a matter for consideration by the Allied Powers.

2\. We consider, however, that it would be a capital political error to indict him as a war criminal. We desire to limit commitment in manpower and other resources by using Imperial Throne as an instrument for the control of the Japanese people, and indictment of present occupant would in our view be most unwise.
