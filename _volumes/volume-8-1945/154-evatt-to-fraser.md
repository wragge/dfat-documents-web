# 154 Evatt to Fraser

Cablegram 137 CANBERRA, 4 August 1945

TOP SECRET PERSONAL

Regarding Potsdam.

It seems to me that the exclusion of the four British Dominions from the Council of Foreign Ministers and the inclusion of China is an action very detrimental to the Dominions, having regard to our contribution to the victory over Italy and Germany and our sustained war effort since 1939. In substance, our position may well be less effective than that of the Dominions in 1919 when Borden, Hughes, Botha, Smuts and Massey [1] at any rate obtained a recognition of the right of the Dominions to make some effective contribution to the making of the European peace.

For further details you will have seen the telegrams sent to London during the course of the Conference and which were repeated to you. [2]
