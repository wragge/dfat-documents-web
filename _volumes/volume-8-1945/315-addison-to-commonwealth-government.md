# 315 Addison to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 409 LONDON, 15 October 1945, 9.45 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

As a result of discussions which have taken place between the members of the British Commonwealth it has now been arranged that a Joint British Commonwealth Force will participate in the occupation of Japan.

2\. This Force will be drawn from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and India and will be under the command of an Australian Commander-in-Chief designated by the Australian Government. He will himself be under the command of General MacArthur and will be served by an integrated Commonwealth staff.

3\. To effect Governmental control there will be set up in Australia a Commonwealth organisation to be known as the 'Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia' and the decisions of this body will pass to the Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Forces.

4\. Units of the British Pacific Fleet will also be stationed in Japanese waters and will remain under the control of the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff continuing to work in close co-operation with the United States Pacific Fleet.

5\. The arrangements for the control of this Commonwealth Force constitute a further development in the close integration of the British Commonwealth Military Organisation.
