# 62 Evatt to Hood

Cablegram E4 WASHINGTON, 21 March 1945, 6.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

1\. Please arrange with Dalziel [1] immediate delivery of copy of Foreign Policy book to each member of Cabinet with a slip stating 'with my compliments'. Please give three copies to the Prime Minister and Beasley and see my wire immediately following to Beasley.

Please convey to Macmahon Ball my warmest regards for his most helpful and timely introductions. [2]

2\. I regard the United States answer on the employment conference a great triumph for Australia - New Zealand policy, especially having in mind the strong disinclination of the United States Government to recognise the importance of full employment. [3] I propose to handle the matter including the consideration of a reply in Washington.

3\. On the Portuguese matter [4], think it would be unwise to have Portuguese troops in Australia. I do not see why we should pull their chestnuts out of the fire. Please discuss this aspect of the matter with Shedden.

4\. Please have review of my book in Current Notes. [5]
