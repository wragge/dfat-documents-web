# 343 Attlee to Chifley

Cablegram 432 LONDON, 25 October 1945, 11 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET PERSONAL

Thank you for your telegram of 24th October about the 'ESPERANCE BAY'. [1] I fully realize your difficulties and am grateful for your appreciation of ours. I note that you intend initially to send the 'ESPERANCE BAY' to Timor and to disembark there some of the more dangerous elements on board.

2\. As regards subsequent action, I am awaiting Admiral Mountbatten's views and he has been asked to telegraph them urgently.
