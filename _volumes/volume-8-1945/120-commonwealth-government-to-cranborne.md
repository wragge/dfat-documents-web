# 120 Commonwealth Government to Cranborne

Cablegram 165 CANBERRA, 22 June 1945

SECRET

Your D. No. 944 of 30th May. [1]

We are grateful for this early indication of your views on future policy in Roumania, Hungary and Bulgaria. It seems to us, however, that the means suggested may turn out to be quite disproportionate to the purposes you have in mind. Peace treaty questions affecting Roumania, Hungary and Bulgaria could not be properly settled except in relation to the claims and requirements in the first instance of such adjoining states as Austria, Greece and Yugoslavia and to hurry on an undertaking of this complexity simply with the object of removing current military occupation difficulties appears scarcely justifiable. Is it [2] necessary at this stage to exclude negotiation of the desired changes in the armistice control of the three countries concerned.
