# 372 Evatt to Burton

Cablegram E20 WASHINGTON, 7 November 1945, 2.55 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

I am very surprised and concerned at the idea of sending such a note at the present time. [1] It can only do harm and may do considerable.

At a later stage the question may possibly deserve reconsideration.
