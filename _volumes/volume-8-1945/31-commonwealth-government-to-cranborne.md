# 31 Commonwealth Government to Cranborne

Cablegram 37 CANBERRA, 10 February 1945

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Liberated Australian Servicemen.

Have received your telegram D.250 [1] containing the text of the Prime Minister's message. My telegram 9th February [2] which you will have received represents the considered decision of the War Cabinet. As we have not been brought into direct negotiation with the Soviet we have to rely on you to secure agreement for proper treatment of our Service personnel. We trust you will secure this within the terms of the agreement without any commitment of Australian personnel to labour service.
