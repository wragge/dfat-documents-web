# 191 Legation in Washington to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram unnumbered WASHINGTON, 14 August 1945, 9.19 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE

Following is full text of statement by the President.

Begins. I have received this afternoon a message from the Japanese Government in reply to the message forwarded to that Government by the Secretary of State on August 11th. I deem this reply is full acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration which specifies the unconditional surrender of Japan. In the reply there is no qualification. Arrangements are now being made for the formal signing of surrender terms at the earliest possible moment.

General Douglas MacArthur has been appointed the Supreme Allied Commander to receive the Japanese surrender. Great Britain, Russia and China will be represented by high ranking officers. Meantime the Allied Armed Forces have been ordered to suspend offensive action. The proclamation of V-J Day must wait upon the formal signing of the surrender terms by Japan.

Following is the Japanese Government's message accepting our terms:-

'Communication of the Japanese Government of August, 14th, 1945, addressed to the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China.

With reference to the Japanese Government's note of August 10th regarding their acceptance of the provisions of the Potsdam declaration and the reply of the Government of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China sent by the American Secretary of State, Byrnes, under the date of August 11th. The Japanese Government have the honour to communicate to the Governments of the Four Powers as follows:-

1\. His Majesty the Emperor has issued an Imperial rescript regarding Japan's acceptance of the Provisions of the Potsdam Declaration.

2\. His Majesty the Emperor is prepared to authorize and ensure the signature by His Government and the Imperial General Headquarters of the necessary terms for carrying out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. His Majesty is also prepared to issue his commands to all the Military, Naval and Air Authorities of Japan and all the forces under their control wherever located to cease active operations, to surrender arms and to issue such other orders as may be required by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces for the execution of the abovementioned terms.' Ends.
