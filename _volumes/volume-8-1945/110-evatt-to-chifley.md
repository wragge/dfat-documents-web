# 110 Evatt to Chifley

Cablegram unnumbered SAN FRANCISCO, 13 June 1945, 1.15 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE

As I anticipated our amendment was defeated a few minutes ago voting ten for twenty against fifteen abstentions five absent. [1] Vote is remarkable evidence of general approval by Conference of our point of view regarding veto on processes of conciliation before Security Council. We made it perfectly clear that our general purpose was to improve charter. Vote is very significant one as we had support of New Zealand, Netherlands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Cuba whereas abstentions included Belgium, Canada, India and other countries which had declared support of our general position.

_

1 i.e. the amendment designed to prevent the use of veto powers on disputes which were brought before the Security Council for peaceful mediation and conciliation. See Documents 99, 101 and 109.
