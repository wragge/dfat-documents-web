IMPORTANT TOP SECRET

My telegram 18th December D. No. 2252 [1] paragraph (6) proposed establishment of United Nations Commission to consider control of atomic energy.

We have been informed by the United States Government that they propose to put forward at Moscow a recommendation for a Commission to be established by and responsible to the General Assembly of the United Nations; the Commission to be composed of one representative of each of those nations represented on the Security Council and of Canada when Canada is not a member of the Security Council; terms of reference to be on the lines of paragraph 7 of the statement issued by the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and Canada and the President of the United States on 15th November. [2]

2\. The United States Government propose that the above recommendation should be accompanied by a memo expressing the hope of the United States Government that the Soviet Government would join in sponsorship of the proposals at the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and referring to their desire for a full exchange of views on the question.

3\. We are considering the United States proposals and shall send our comments as soon as possible.
