# 131 Cranborne to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 247 LONDON, 13 July 1945, 8.37 p.m.

TOP SECRET

Thank you for your telegram 165 of 22nd June [1] on the future policy towards Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary. Our proposal for the conclusion of peace treaties was not put forward solely to remove current difficulties but because it seemed to us most practicable of the several courses of action which we had reviewed for the purpose of attaining our objects in the countries in question as set out in my telegram D.944 of 30th May. [2] As there stated we had not reached any definite decision.

2\. It will be seen from my telegram of to-day D1208 [3] that the United States Government are not in favour of our proposals and that we are prepared to leave them in abeyance for the present although we still feel that they may offer better prospects of success and we may find it opportune to revert to them when the subject is next raised.
