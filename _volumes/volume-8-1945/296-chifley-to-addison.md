# 296 Chifley to Addison

Cablegram 327 CANBERRA, 6 October 1945

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Reference my No. 324 of 4th October [1], the Commonwealth Government nominates Lieutenant General J. Northcott, C.B., M.V.O., as Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Force for the occupation of Japan, with his present temporary rank of Lieutenant General. Lieutenant General Northcott has been Chief of the General Staff since September, 1942.

2\. We should be glad to have the concurrence of the Governments concerned in Lieutenant General Northcott's appointment, and would appreciate early advice as the Commander-in-Chief should proceed with the organisation of his staff urgently.

3\. If the concurrence of the Indian Government is necessary, it is presumed the United Kingdom Government will obtain it.
