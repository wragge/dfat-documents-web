# 369 Burton to Evatt and Hood

Cablegrams 1666, 494 CANBERRA, 8 November 1945

MOST IMMEDIATE

1\. Reference telegram regarding note to Netherlands Minister. [1] Acting Minister will speak to Netherlands Minister along lines indicated but will not hand note. Objective of discussion will be to attempt to get a fresh start in our relations with the Dutch representative here. Minister will be firm regarding some of the activities and false statements of the Dutch but will suggest to them that in future there be a greater degree of co-operation not only as between ministers but between their officers. He will refer to our common interest in this area and our common interests as middle powers and hope that we can work together as such. He will suggest discussions on all outstanding matters. We are not sure of success as the Dutch authorities have on many occasions been demonstrated against at wharves and elsewhere and appear to be getting the feeling that they are not welcome in Australia.

Furthermore they are generally bewildered and suspicious.

Everything possible will be done to find a common basis for improved relations.

2\. You should know that co-operation and friendly relations exist between our security, shipping and other such officers and mutually satisfactory arrangements are being made but are being knocked over at higher levels.
