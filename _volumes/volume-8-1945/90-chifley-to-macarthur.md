Cablegram CAB213 CANBERRA, 20 May 1945

TOP SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE

1\. The Government has no hesitation in agreeing to the use of the 7th Australian Division as planned by you.

2\. As previously advised, it is not intended to take any steps to reduce the present approved operational strength of the Australian Army until after the completion of the next phase of operations.

3\. It necessarily sought your observations, as Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Area, on the submission of the Commander- in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces. It fully accepts your views which agree with the Government's conception of its commitments and by which it absolutely intends to abide.
