# 286 Byrnes to Evatt

## Letter LONDON, 2 October 1945

I have received your letter of October [1] stating your view that the Far Eastern Commission should have its headquarters in Washington. I am glad to have your thoughts in this matter.

There was criticism by some officials of several of the Allied Governments participating in the establishment of the Commission that the United States Government was seeking to have the Commission confine its work to Washington. The United States Government had no such intention. Therefore, the United States Government will instruct its representative to vote that the Commission meet in Tokyo whenever the other members of the Commission express a desire to do so. Of course, it is for the Commission to decide when and where it will meet.

JAMES F. BYRNES
