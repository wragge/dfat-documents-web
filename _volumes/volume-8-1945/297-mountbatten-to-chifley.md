# 297 Mountbatten to Chifley

Cablegram SAC24425 [COLOMBO], 6 October 1945, 6.47 a.m.

PERSONAL SECRET

Lieutenant Governor General Van Mook has told me that strikers in Australia are preventing the loading and sailing of ships des[t]ined for Batavia.

2\. The situation regarding relief stores in N.E.I. is serious and I shall be very grateful for your personal assistance in ensuring the sailing of mercy ships carrying relief supplies which form an essential part of our re-occupation programme. I must emphasise that there will be very serious consequences if there is a protracted delay in the loading and departure of these ships.

3\. I should like to make it clear that this appeal refers to mercy ships only and I have naturally no wish to concern myself with the loading of ships with arms and ammunition for the Dutch Government.
