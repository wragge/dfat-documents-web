# 184 Fraser to Evatt

Cablegram 130 WELLINGTON, 13 August 1945, 11.20 p.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL

I agree that the exclusion of the British Dominions from the Council of Foreign Ministers is a matter for protest and further representations for this practical recognition of the sacrifices made by the Dominions in the European theatre. I am repeating to you my telegram to the Secretary of State on this subject [1], and I propose to send a further personal message to Attlee drawing attention in particular to the most unsatisfactory attitude adopted towards Australia and New Zealand in the Dominions Office reply to your telegram.
