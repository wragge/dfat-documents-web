Poland.

1\. Settlement arrived at between Polish representatives in Moscow last night. Communique will be issued by the Moscow Commission late to-night announcing the disbandment of the Commission as a settlement has been arrived at on the Polish question. The new Polish Government agreed upon will make full announcement of the settlement from Warsaw on its arrival at Warsaw within the next few days.

One third of the government will be communist, one third from socialist and other political groups and one third peasant party. Poles at present abroad will be invited to come to Poland and participate in the affairs of Poland. Free elections will be held for the election of a new government as soon as possible.
