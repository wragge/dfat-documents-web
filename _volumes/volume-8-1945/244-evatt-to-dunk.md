# 244 Evatt to Dunk

Cablegram EC6 LONDON, 14 September 1945, 1.45 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

My telegram No. EC3. [1] My telegram No. EC8 [2] contains the text of the reply of the Portuguese Government to a communication made through the Ambassador on 10th September. From the political angle the reply seems adequate and I presume that the Service Authorities will now arrange for acceptance of the surrender of Japanese Forces in the colony forthwith. The arrangements made should have regard, both to the terms of the Portuguese reply and to the necessity of ensuring that the surrender is fully effective from the military point of view. The chief consideration now is speed. Please advise immediately action has been taken.

1 Dispatched 10 September. On file AA : A1838/2, 377/3/3/2. It reported a discussion on surrender arrangements with the Portuguese Ambassador, the Duke of Palmella, during which it was proposed that the Portuguese Govt publicly recognise Australia's role in the defence of Portuguese Timor and announce its intention of seeking a closer relationship between Portuguese Timor and Australia in accordance with the 1943 correspondence.
