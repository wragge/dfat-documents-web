# 1 Evatt to McIntosh

Cablegram 9 CANBERRA, 6 January 1945

MOST IMMEDIATE

Reference D.1827 and D.5, World Organisation. [1] My view is that issues raised regarding right and extent of veto of Great Powers on Security Council, though very important, should not be regarded as so important as to preclude the very early establishment of proposed organisation. We regard Russian and American adherence to world organisation at earliest possible moment as vital. Further we would wish not to be bound to any cut and dried scheme before a general conference. In other words there must be maximum participation by powers other than Big Three in shaping details and procedure of organisation. This I think is in line with the recent analysis of Dumbarton Oaks draft which we made at Wellington.

I would appreciate the views of your Prime Minister before preparing reply to Dominions Office. [2]
