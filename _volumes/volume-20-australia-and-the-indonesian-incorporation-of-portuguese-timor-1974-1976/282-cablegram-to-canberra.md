## Australian Journalists in Timor

Ref O.JA25231

General Adenan advised us last night that he regretted he still had no news of the missing journalists. He said he had raised the matter at a meeting of the Committee on Timor on 20 October and it had been agreed to expedite enquiries on our behalf. He hoped he could tell us something today.
