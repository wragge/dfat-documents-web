## Portuguese Timor: Missing Journalists

In view of what is reported in paragraph 4 of JA29031 we asked Tjan whether he thought there was any possibility that any of the five journalists had survived. He said it was evident that there had been no survivors.

  2. Our American contacts also believe that all five died at Balibo.
