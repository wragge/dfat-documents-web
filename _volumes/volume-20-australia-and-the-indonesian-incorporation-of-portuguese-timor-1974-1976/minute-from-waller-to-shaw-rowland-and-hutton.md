# Minute from Waller to Shaw, Rowland and Hutton

Canberra, 11 January 1963

CONFIDENTIAL

Timor

The Minister feels that for the record we should again urge Portugal to do something about her colonies, particularly Timor. Then when the blow falls, we can say that on several occasions over the last few years, we have urged on Salazar the necessity for action.

May I have your comments please?
