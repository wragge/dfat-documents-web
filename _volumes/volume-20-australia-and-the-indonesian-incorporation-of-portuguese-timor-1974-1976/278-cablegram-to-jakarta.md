# 278 Cablegram to Jakarta

Canberra, 20 October 1975, 3.27 p.m.

O.CH280318 RESTRICTED ROUTINE

## Overtime

For Woolcott

You may not appreciate how serious the financial situation in Canberra is-further payment of overtime can only be at the expense of non-payment of salaries.

  2. In present circumstances time will have to be spent on essential work, such as Timor, at the expense of other things. We recognise this must mean a consequent decline in output and efficiency.
