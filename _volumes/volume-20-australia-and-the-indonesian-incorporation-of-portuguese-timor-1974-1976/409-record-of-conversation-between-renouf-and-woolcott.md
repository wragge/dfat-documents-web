# 409 Record of Conversation Between Renouf and Woolcott

## Canberra, 30 January 1976

## East Timor

  1. In accordance with the Minister's instructions, I telephoned Mr Woolcott at 10.45 a.m. on 30 January. I impressed upon Woolcott the need for him to do everything possible to persuade Indonesia to allow Mr Winspeare to visit Fretilin-held areas in East Timor.1 I told him that in the opinion of the Australian Government, Indonesia would be well advised, in its own interests, to allow this to happen.
  2. Woolcott said that he understood and would do his very best. He had already lined up a number of appointments on 30 January for this purpose. Of course, the going would be hard as Indonesia was already falling back upon the argument that she would have to consult the PGET; in other words, it was not strictly Indonesia's business.
  3. Woolcott also 'flagged' discreetly with me the point that if we wanted Indonesia to be receptive about the idea of Mr Fraser visiting Bali at the end of the Asean Summit, it would be helpful not to be too critical of Indonesia's policy in its various aspects towards East Timor at this particular time.

  * 1 On 27 January Peacock issued a statement that the uncertain security situation would preclude any Australian aircraft carrying the Winspeare mission 'into the war zones in Timor'. The two Portuguese corvettes could possibly take the mission to one of the Fretilin zones in East Timor. On 28 January, Peacock added that the powerful radio transmitters on board the corvettes were the best means ofWinspeare's establishing contact with Fretilin. A third statement, issued on 29 January, requested the assistance of the Indonesian Government 'in the areas where it had influence' to guarantee the mission safe passage in their efforts to contact Fretilin. Cablegram CH314284 (29 January) instructed Woolcott to discuss with the Indonesian Government Peacock's proposal that Portuguese corvettes be used to help Winspeare make contact with Fretilin and to transport him to East Timor. It added: 'time is now very much against Winspeare's chances of holding talks with Fretilin in Timor, but we do wish to make every effort to assist'.
