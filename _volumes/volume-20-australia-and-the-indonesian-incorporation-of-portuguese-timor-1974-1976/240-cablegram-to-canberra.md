# 240 Cablegram to Canberra

Jakarta, 23 September 1975

O.JA2018 SECRET PRIORITY

Portuguese Timor

Ref. 0.CH2699401

We note from your reference telegram that charter flights from Australia to Portuguese Timor would be suspended _inter alia_ if the security situation in Timor were to deteriorate to a point which made such flights hazardous.

  2. Today's local press has reported that UDT and APODETI have combined their military operations and will use guerrilla tactics against FRETILIN beginning this week. (This accords generally with information we have received from Indonesian sources.) In these circumstances our Indonesian contacts do not rule out the possibility that attempts will be made to put airports out of action.
  3. The future security of the airports is also relevant in your consideration of Australian food aid for Portuguese Timor.

  * 1 22 September. In response to a question by Tjan whether Australia could prevent charter flights from Darwin, it noted that power to approve or refuse charter flights rested with the Department of Transport, and that it would be contrary to Australian political convention to prevent journalists or members of Parliament from going to Timor. Flights would only be suspended if the Portuguese refused visas, or if the security situation were to deteriorate to a point which made flights hazardous.
