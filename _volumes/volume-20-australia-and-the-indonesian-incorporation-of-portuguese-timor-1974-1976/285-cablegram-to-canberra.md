## Portuguese Timor: Missing Journalists

Ref. O.JA25581

General Adenan has just advised Dan that no further news had been received from Timor about the journalists.

  2. We asked Adenan why it was taking such a long time for them to convey a message from UDT/Apodeti. After all, UDT leader, Lopez da Cruz was reported in the press two days ago as having said that four bodies, possibly Australian, had been found at Balibo.
  3. Adenan said he was at a loss to know what the hold-up had been. The Indonesian authorities in Jakarta were making further urgent enquiries this morning. He still hoped he would have something to give us today.
  4. We have given Adenan the details concerning the three Channel 7 men set out in paragraph 3 ofCH281029.2
  5. We asked Adenan to send an urgent message to Governor El Tari in Kupang about Johnson's visit. He undertook to do this.
  6. Please inform Maher (Channel 7) (Telephone Melbourne 693975 or 690771) and Cornford (Telephone Melbourne 421785) that we are still awaiting confirmation. Both have rung the Embassy. Gerald Stone (Channel 9 in Sydney) had also rung us earlier.
