# 136 Cablegram to Canberra

Lisbon, 28 May 1975

O.LB976 UNCLASSIFIED RoUTINE

## Portuguese Timor

Lisbon papers of 28 May report unilateral withdrawal of UDT from the coalition with FRETILIN. UDT communique detailing reasons for withdrawal, states that FRETILIN had systematically and scandalously disrespected the principles on which the coalition was based and had indulged in ideological and even physical aggression. It concluded that FRETILIN's actions could seriously compromise the independence of Timor-Dili.

  2. FRETILIN President, Xavier do Amaral, is reported as describing the UDT withdrawal as an act of desperation and of political immaturity.
