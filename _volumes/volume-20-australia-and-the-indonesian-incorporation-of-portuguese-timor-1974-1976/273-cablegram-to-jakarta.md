O.CH280045 SECRET AUSTEO PRIORITY

## Australian Journalists in Timor

Ref O.JA2495[1](#f1)

We need confirmation of this development.[2](#f2) In other words we need the Indonesians to inform us of what has happened.

  2. Please therefore approach the Indonesians again and inform them that, according to reports by FRETILIN soldiers, the five Australian newsmen took shelter in an old fort at Balibo which was later subject to a direct hit by an artillery shell. Could the Indonesians confirm this?
