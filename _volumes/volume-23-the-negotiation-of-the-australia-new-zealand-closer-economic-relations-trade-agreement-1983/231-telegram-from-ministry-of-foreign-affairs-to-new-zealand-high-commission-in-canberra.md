# 231 Telegram from Ministry of Foreign Affairs to New Zealand High Commission in Canberra

Wellington, 9 October 1981

No 3548. CONFIDENTIAL NZEO IMMEDIATE

**CER: Elimination of Import Restrictions in Reasonable Time**

  1. Further to our separate message, you should know that very informal soundings have been taken of Manufacturers Federation Secretariat and Stevens (President) only of elected officers. A wider consultation with the Manufacturers Federation at this sensitive time (Federation conference later this month) would inevitably bring an unhelpful reaction.
  2. We have taken account of their reactions in suggesting following approach in your response to Australian officials. We suggest you initially try the following formulation:   
'At the end of the tariff phasing period, there would be a review which would examine the progress towards liberalisation of access restrictions and assess what further action may be necessary consistent with the objectives of a closer economic relationship.'  
Depending on the Australian response you might then want to move to the following:  
'At the end of the tariff phasing period, there would be a review which would examine the progress towards liberalisation of import restrictions and assess what needed to be done to effect complete removal of the remaining restrictions by a terminal date to be considered at the review and which would be consistent with the objective of "reasonable time".'   
This is in line with the approach put to the CEC.
  3. Point made in para 3 of our earlier immediate message replying to your 3004 of course applies.
