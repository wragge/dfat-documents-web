Canberra, 2 April 1982

## NOTE FOR FILE

Mr F. E. Anderson rang me from Wellington Thursday, 1 April to advise that the Australian and New Zealand dairy industries had arrived at an agreement on trans-Tasman trade in dairy products. Mr Anderson said he believed the industry agreement would be acceptable and suitable for inclusion in a CER agreement with New Zealand.

Mr Anderson asked that I advise the Minister that agreement had been reached between the two industries and I requested Mr Barker of the Minister's office to pass this message on to the Minister.
