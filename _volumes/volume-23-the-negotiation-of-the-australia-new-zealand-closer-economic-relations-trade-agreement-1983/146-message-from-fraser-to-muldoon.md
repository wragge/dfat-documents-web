## 146 Message from Fraser1 to Muldoon

Canberra, 2 March 1981

CONFIDENTIAL

Thank you for your letter of 17 February 1981 regarding possible timing of a meeting to consider a package on a closer economic relationship between our two countries. I very much appreciate you giving me an indication of your thinking which will help my Cabinet in its consideration of the work so far undertaken by officials.

I share your view that this matter should be pursued as expeditiously as possible and Australian officials are aware of the need to avoid all unnecessary delays. The need for and the timing of, future ministerial meetings should become clearer in the next few weeks following the next round of negotiations by our senior officials.
