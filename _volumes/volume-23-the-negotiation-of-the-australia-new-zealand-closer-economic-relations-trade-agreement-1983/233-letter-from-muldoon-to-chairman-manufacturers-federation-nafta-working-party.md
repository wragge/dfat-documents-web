Wellington, 9 November 1981

This is to acknowledge your letter of 2 November regarding the possibility of the Federation participating in CER discussions.

I agree with your suggestion that a joint working party should meet to discuss the total CER package and I will advise the Chairman of the Government Committee to contact you to arrange the details.
