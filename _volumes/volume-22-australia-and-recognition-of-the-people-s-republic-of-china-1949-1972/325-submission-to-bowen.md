# 325 SUBMISSION TO BOWEN

Canberra, 24 March 1972

Secret

China Policy

With reference to Mr Renouf’s telegram 13501 (attached), which we did not see until after the preparation of our other submission to you today on his talk with Mr Huang, we are of the view that there would be no point in going back to Mr Huang about the ‘fallacies’ unless and until the Government were to decide to enter into negotiations about the establishment of diplomatic relations.

2\. The fact is that we now have what almost (but not quite) amounts to a ‘One China, Two Rival Governments’ position (though it would be unwise to say so publicly); and though this was not listed among Mr Huang’s ‘fallacies’ . it figures in the Nixon—Chou communique2 as one of the ‘activities’ which the PRC ‘firmly opposes’ .

3\. All in all, it would seem better to leave matters stand and to wait and see whether Peking, after digesting what Mr Renouf had to say, wishes to resume the dialogue.
