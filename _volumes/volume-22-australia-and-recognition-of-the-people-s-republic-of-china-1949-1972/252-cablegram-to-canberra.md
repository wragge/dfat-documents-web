Chinese Representation

Secretary of State (Rogers) spoke yesterday to the New Zealand Ambassador (Comer) and me about the Chinese representation item. He said he thought it should be possible to keep Taiwan in the United Nations. I remarked that there was still a feeling in many countries that the United States was only going through the motions and not seriously engaged in the effort and I said that this feeling would have to be overcome if we were to be successful. Rogers replied that the United States was fully committed to keeping the Republic of China in the United Nations and he personally attached great importance to it. Comer said that the slowness of the United States to come forward with a resolution was leading some to think the United States was not serious.

2\. Comer argued that if the resolution was to obtain the requisite support specific provision has to be made in the resolution for the Security Council seat to go to Peking. He said that since the United States would inevitably have to come down to that view it would be better to grasp the nettle immediately so that the resolutions could be put in without delay. Rogers replied that he had been delaying in order to allow efforts to persuade the Republic of China to throw its weight behind the resolutions. Probably at least four countries would not vote for a resolution unless it had the support of the Republic of China. Rogers said he felt sure that the Republic would indicate to its supporters that they should vote for resolutions that did not contain a reference to the Security Council seat. Rogers thought it was worth while waiting a little longer to give an opportunity to bring the Taiwanese round to the view that they should also let it be known to their supporters that they should vote for a resolution even if it allocated the Security Council seat to Peking. The opinion had steadily developed on Taiwan that the important point was to be able to remain in the United Nations.

3\. Comer said that in any case even if we won this year we might only gain a year. Peking would not take its seat as long as the Republic of China remained in the United Nations and the battle would have to be fought over again next year. Comer thought that this consideration was in the minds of many countries in approaching the question this year. Rogers replied that he would by no means rule out the possibility of Peking taking its seat even if the Republic of China was also seated in the General Assembly. He said that he had nothing to go on but countries had changed their positions in the past.

4\. Rogers said that he was open to argument on timing. Bush (the Permanent Representative of the United States at the United Nations) would be back in New York next week and this would give an opportunity to look at the question.

Plimsoll.
