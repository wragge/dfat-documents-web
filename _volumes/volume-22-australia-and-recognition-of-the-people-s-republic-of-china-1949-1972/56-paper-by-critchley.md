# 56 PAPER BY CRITCHLEY

Canberra, 5 May 1955

**Possible Topics for a Far-Eastern Conference**

Possible subjects for a Far-Eastern Conference would include the following:—

1\. Cease fire in the Formosan Straits.

2\. Avoidance of the use of force.

3\. The future of the offshore islands.

4\. CommunistChina’s representation in the United Nations.

5\. Supervisory Commission in Korea.

6\. United States and other prisoners in China.

7\. Trade between Communist China and other countries.

8\. Future of Formosa.

9\. Unification of Korea.

10\. Laos. (Acceptance of legal authority of Laotian Government in the Northern Provinces).

11\. The position in Northern Viet Nam.

It would not necessarily be advisable to include all of these subjects. There are strong arguments for avoiding reopening questions on Indo China or the unification of Korea at this stage.

Possible concessions that might be made to Communist China and which might be obtained from Communist China are set out below:—

_Subjects on which possible Concessions might be made to Communist China:_

(a) The offshore islands—Quemoy and Matsu;

(b) Nationalist interference with shipping and raids, including propaganda raids on Chinese territory;

(c) The present United Nations trade restrictions on Communist China and the general question of trade between Communist China and other countries;

(d) Recognition of Communist China;

(e) Communist China representation in the United Nations.

_Concessions that might be Obtained from Communist China:_

(a) Cease fire in the Formosan Straits;

(b) Avoidance of the use of force;

(c) Release of United States and other prisoners in China.

Not all the concessions which might be made to Communist China would necessarily be negotiated in the first instance. At the outset, for example, concessions might be limited to the first three items listed—although consideration of Communist Chinese representation in the United Nations is a subject which it might not be possible to delay for long.

It is not suggested that we should indicate to other governments our ideas on subjects for negotiation at present.

The foregoing notes are intended as a first approach to the problem and to indicate that there is a range of subjects on which a bargain could be struck.
