# 183 LETTER FROM McMAHON TO SATO

Canberra, 19 May 1971

I am taking the opportunity of the visit to Japan of Ambassador Shizuo Saito to let you know the Australian Government’s thinking about the People’s Republic of China and especially its likely admission to the United Nations.

We do value the exchanges we have had with Ambassador Saito here in Canberra and with officials of the Gaimusho in Tokyo. As a result of these discussions, I believe there is a great deal of common ground in our approach to the problem.

Both as Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, I have been at some pains to explain to the Australian people the complexities of the China problem and I now think our presentation is having a good effect.

I continue to stress our desire to keep in close touch with your Government and that of the United States. I have also said that the Australian Government will continue to handle the question cautiously and pragmatically, weighing the consequences of each step in the light of the advantages and disadvantages which it might entail.

In summary, our views as they now stand are:

We accept that the admission of the People’s Republic of China to the United Nations either this year or next, is a virtual certainty. It seems to us axiomatic that the People’s Republic will succeed to the Security Council seat now held by the Republic of China. Any alternative approach seeking to avoid such an arrangement will be regarded as an unrealistic device by those whose support will be vital, and will fail.

We have also attached considerable importance to the rights of Taiwan, including its rights to representation in the United Nations if it so wishes.

We have as our long-term goal the normalization of relations with Peking and we have acknowledged that a range of questions require the cooperation of the People’s Republic of China if settlements are to be achieved.

Already we have made some gestures towards Peking and have indicated our readiness to make more. On 11 May, I announced that we had decided to explore the possibilities of establishing a dialogue with the Chinese People’s Government.

In the discussions we have had with your officials and those of the United States, we have stressed the continuing erosion of international support for Taiwan.

It is becoming increasingly difficult as the days go by to preserve Taiwan’s membership of the United Nations and I have already written to President Nixon on this point, seeking his views.1

I assure you I appreciate the difficulties and heavy responsibility you face in reaching a decision on the courses of action to be taken on the China problem. Nonetheless, an indication of your present thinking would be of the greatest value to us.
