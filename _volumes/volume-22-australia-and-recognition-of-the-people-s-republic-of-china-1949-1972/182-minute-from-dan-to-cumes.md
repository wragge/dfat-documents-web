# 182 MINUTE FROM DAN TO CUMES

Canberra, 14 May 1971

Secret

**Chinese Representation in the United Nations**

In a minute of 19th April, 1971 I attached the texts of our two draft resolutions which, taken together, constitute a dual representation formulation.2 Only the operative parts of those resolutions had been considered previously, and accepted as a basis for possible future discussions with our allies. The preambular paragraphs were added when the minute of 19th April, 1971 was circulated.

2\. Sir Kenneth Bailey has now refined these texts. They are attached.

3\. According to Washington’s 2485 of 8th May, 19713 the White House staff is working on the subject of U.N. representation and is still asking the State Department for additional papers. Although the prospects of the Americans deciding in favour of a DR approach are becoming more remote (as indeed are the prospects of a DR attempt succeeding), I think we should now pass to the Americans the completed texts of our two resolutions. (The Americans have only the operative parts, and in their original form: Sir Kenneth Bailey has amended the final operative paragraph of the draft substantive resolution.)

4\. If these texts are conveyed to the U.S., the opportunity might be taken to say that we do not regard the amended Important Question resolution as a procedural gimmick. On more than one occasion the State Department’s U.N. Section has described any I.Q. resolution as a procedural device which had lost its credibility. We should resist firmly any suggestion that a resolution based on Article 18— particularly one that seeks only to protect the rights of a member—is nothing more than a gimmick.
