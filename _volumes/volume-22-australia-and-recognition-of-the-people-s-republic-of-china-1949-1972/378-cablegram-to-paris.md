# 378 CABLEGRAM TO PARIS

Canberra, 20 December 1972

6225\. Secret Immediate

****

China

You have discretion to raise with Huang after the actual signing of the communique the question of Francis James1 and the question of establishing an Australian Embassy in Peking. If you decide not to raise either of these matters at that time, you should seek an early meeting with Huang after the signing.

2\. On Francis James, you should point out that he has now been detained inChina for more than three years, that his case is a matter of widespread publicinterest in Australia, and that naturally the Australian Government too isconcerned. The Australian Government would accordingly welcome informationon the charges laid against him and the details of his sentence, and on his healthand general well–being. You should also ask that we be given consular access toJames at the earliest practicable opportunity.

3\. On the question of opening an Embassy in Peking, you should say that weshould like to send to Peking early in January a party of five or so, to be led by Cottrill (whom the Chinese may remember from the table tennis visit), to openan Embassy immediately under Cottrill as Charge. If, despite China’s insistingthat diplomatic relations be established as from the signing of the communique,Huang objects that the Embassy cannot be opened so long as officialrepresentation remains in Taiwan and Australia, you should say that we shouldstill like to send the party early in January. But we should describe it as anadvance party sent to pave the way for opening the Embassy the day after officialrepresentation is withdrawn from Taiwan and Australia. In those circumstances,we appreciate that the members of the party would not have formal diplomaticstatus until the Embassy opened, but we should appreciate their being givenevery facility, assistance, and protection.
