# 16 CABLEGRAM TO OTTAWA

Canberra, 25 May 1950

18\. Secret

For Pearson from Spender.

My 5 of 2nd March.1

I should be most grateful for latest information on Canadian Government’s attitude towards possible recognition of Chinese Communist regime.

My own view is that so far as Australia is concerned, at present time, there are no particular reasons which would make such action a matter of pressing urgency.
