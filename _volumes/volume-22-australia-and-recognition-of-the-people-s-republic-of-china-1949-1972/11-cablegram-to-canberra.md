# 11 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

London, 6 February 1950

538\. Confidential Immediate

Your telegram 513.1 United Kingdom officials see no immediate way of removing the stalemate nor of disconnecting the issue from recognition policies. The findings of a body such as that suggested in your paragraph 3 would hardly influence governments which have decided to recognize the new government or those which are reluctant to do so. The situation would become worse if the findings of such bodies set up by different organs conflicted. They doubt whether the Economical and Social Council has the power to refer such a question to the International Court. Legal experts are considering the possibilities and I will report again as soon as possible.

2\. Instructions remain substantially the same, i.e. the matter depends on majority decisions in each body faced with the issue. How long the United Kingdom representatives continue to abstain appears to depend on general developments. The Foreign Secretary has just returned from Colombo and may consider the matter afresh especially as it is giving the United Kingdom direct concern through the possible impotence of the Security Council to pass the resolution in the Kashmir dispute in the absence of the USSR.

3\. United Kingdom officials see no substantial evidence that the USSR intends to leave the United Nations.
