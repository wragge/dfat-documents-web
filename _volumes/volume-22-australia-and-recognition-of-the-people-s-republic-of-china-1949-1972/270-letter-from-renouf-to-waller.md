# 270 LETTER FROM RENOUF TO WALLER

Paris, 8 October 1971

Secret Personal

Since returning, I have been giving some more thought to the question of the ‘dialogue’, particularly in view of the invitation to the 1 October party1 and in view of the friendly way I was then received. I conclude as follows.

If Ministers wish to go ahead, I cannot see any real reason why we should not after the UN issue is debated, begin a discussion about the establishment of diplomatic relations preserving the same strict secrecy as we were originally able to achieve. The purpose of the exercise would be to ascertain what the Chinese would demand of us for the establishment of relations should the Government eventually decide to enter into them.

In saying this, I have in mind particularly that Nixon’s visit is looming up ahead and it is to be suspected that Kissinger will be involved in discussions of substance when he returns to Peking. I have also in mind that such discussions with the Chinese always take time and we would in my view be well advised to start on them soon so as to prepare the ground for later. If we begin on this process, we could also get the Chinese to come alternatively to our premises as should be done.

Another reason I make this suggestion at this time is that the Minister in his talk with me in Canberra said that the Government was determined to recognize China and hence have diplomatic relations _before_ the Americans did so (I pleaded this point with him).2 If this is to be done, we do not have much time to spare.
