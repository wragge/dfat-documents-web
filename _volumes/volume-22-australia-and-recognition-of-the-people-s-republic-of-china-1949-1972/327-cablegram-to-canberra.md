1398\. Secret Priority

China

My 1343.1

The document I handed to the Chinese Ambassador last Thursday had been returned in the mail this morning with the following cover. Begins—

Mr Ambassador, because of the fact that the document, which you handed over on March 23 1972, wrongly names the Taiwan province of our country, hereby we have but to turn (_sic_) it to you.

The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China to the Republic of France. Ends.

Renouf.
