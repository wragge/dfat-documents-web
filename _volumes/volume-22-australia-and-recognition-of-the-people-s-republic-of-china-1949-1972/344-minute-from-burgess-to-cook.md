# 344 MINUTE FROM BURGESS TO COOK

Canberra, 10 November 1972

****

I think an initial break with the ROC is one of the options that should be canvassed. It could have some appeal to the incoming government for these reasons—

(1) a decisive and probably popular step which could be made immediately

(2) like the Mexicans we may be able to avoid referring to Taiwan in the eventual communique with the PRC

(3) with the withdrawal of the ROC Embassy the way would be open to invite a PRC delegation here to negotiate diplomatic relations and perhaps other matters. This would have maximum local impact and could save busy Ministers a trip.

We would of course be hoping that the ROC would be prepared to talk about setting up unofficial offices during the interregnum.

I think the issues could be blurred when responding publicly to the questions you envisage, viz—we are aware of PRC’s claim.

> —we do not think it appropriate to express a view on the territorial limits of another country. As for status of govt on Taiwan, having recognised PRC as China’s sole legal govt, it follows that we do make regard that on Taiwan as the govt of China.

1 A statement issued by the Government of Jamaica on 31 October indicated that the Jamaican Government no longer regarded the Government of the Republic of China as the government of China. The statement did not say that it was not a government at all, and referred to it as the ‘Government of Taiwan’ .
