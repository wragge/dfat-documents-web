# 14 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Ottawa, 27 February 1950

16\. Secret

Your 13.1 Our 11.2

The Minister3 replied by letter classified Secret.

Resume follows:—

Begin—

1\. Recognition is still before Cabinet.

2\. For the Minister's personal information the trend of discussion is that Canada will recognise and the matter is one of timing.

3\. In Pearson's own view the date will probably be about the end of March unless conditions change.

4\. United States policy will be one factor though _not_ the governing one. Enquiries have been made in Washington and results will be conveyed when received.4

5\. Pearson would be interested to learn the Minister's views as to likelihood of early Australian recognition.

6\. It would be a happy circumstance if both Governments take the same action about the same time, though Pearson recognises circumstances may prevent this Ends.

Comment:

1\. We learn that Pearson may shortly meet Jessup5 to discuss the subject.

2\. Copy of Pearson's letter follows next bag via London.

1 Document 13.

2 18 February. Replying to Canberra's Cablegram 13 (Document 13), it noted that Pearson was currently out of town, and communicated Pearson's assurances that he would do his best to ensure a Canadian Cabinet decision on China by 'next week', after which Spender would be informed.

3 That is, Lester Pearson.

4 On 3 March, Pearson communicated the results of enquiries in Washington. Points made were: that the US Government was not, at present, in a position to act on the recognition question; that Acheson had commented that no decision would be made without full consultation with Congressional Committees; that neither Congressional nor public opinion would be conducive to recognition for some time; that US opinion had been hardened by Peking's attitude resulting in recent consular troubles and the withdrawal of US representation; that it was thus improbable that the Administration would act before November's gubernatorial and mid–term Congressional elections; and, finally, that th.e desire to protect the future of the Nationalist Government was influencing the United States.

5 Philip C. Jessup, US Ambassador at Large.
