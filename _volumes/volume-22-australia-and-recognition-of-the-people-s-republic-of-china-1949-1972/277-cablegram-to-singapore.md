Chinese Representation

Please convey as soon as possible the following message from the Prime Minister to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.2 If in the light of your discussion this seems desirable, you could ask Lee whether he would like to discuss the matter further with the Prime Minister by telephone.

Begins:

‘I want to ask your help about one aspect of the representation of the People’s Republic of China at the United Nations. I do this because I believe that in substance your interests and ours are practically the same.

You will know that we have taken a very active part in moves to promote the representation of the People’s Republic in the United Nations and its seating in the Security Council. But we also think that it is in the best interests of the Asian peoples and ourselves that Taiwan should remain a member.

Australia and 21 other countries including Japan, Thailand, the Philippines and New Zealand are co–sponsoring an Important Question resolution which seeks only to prevent the expulsion by a simple majority of the Republic of China. We do not think it is proper that the entry of the People’s Republic should be impeded—or that it should appear that this is happening.

It is our hope that even countries which will not support the Important Question resolution itself will agree that it is a procedural proposal which, in keeping with past practice in the United Nations, should be accorded priority in voting over any substantive resolution.

At present, with the exception of Singapore and Malaysia, all the United Nations members of East and South–East Asia including Cambodia and Laos are committed to vote for the Important Question resolution. Indonesia has assured us that they will support this motion and we believe that if priority is carried they will also vote for the Important Question resolution itself.

So what I am proposing to you is that you might find it possible to vote in favour of the priority motion, if not for the Important Question resolution itself.’
