# 225 LETTER FROM APPLING TO WALLER

Canberra, 2 August 1971

Secret

I have been instructed to deliver a message from Secretary Rogers to the Foreign Minister. Since Mr. Bowen will just be entering on his new duties today,1 it seemed best to bring the message to your attention, requesting that you inform him of it. A similar message is being delivered to only a few other governments, and we are asked to emphasize the need to safeguard the information until it is announced publicly. The text of the message is as follows:

‘A. As you know, since the President’s announcement on July 15 we have been in particularly active and urgent consultations with the Government of the Republic of China (GRC) on Chinese representation policy. The GRC now understands and accepts the need for a new strategy that would involve representation for both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the United Nations.

B. The President has decided that in view of this situation and because our continued public silence on this issue may jeopardize any chance of maintaining ROC membership in the United Nations, it is important that we should now publicly disclose our above position and in favor of a resolution which would make a proposal to deprive the ROC of UN representation an important question.

C. Accordingly, at a press conference to be held in Washington probably on August 2 or 3, I plan to announce that the United States will support action at the General Assembly to seat the People’s Republic of China and at the same time will oppose any action to expel the Republic of China or to otherwise deprive it of representation at the UN. I will go on to say that our consultations have indicated that the question of China’s seat on the Security Council is a matter which many nations may wish to address and that we are prepared to have this question resolved on the basis of a decision of the Members of the UN.

D. I would like to express our great appreciation for the advice and assistance which you and your Government have given during our past consultations on this exceedingly difficult problem. I strongly hope we will continue to work very closely on this issue in the days ahead.

E. We would appreciate your views on the next steps now to be taken. We have in mind convening as early as possible a meeting of like–minded nations at our UN Mission in New York to seek agreement upon common texts for important question resolution and resolution to provide representation for both ROC and PRC as well as upon tactics to be followed.’
