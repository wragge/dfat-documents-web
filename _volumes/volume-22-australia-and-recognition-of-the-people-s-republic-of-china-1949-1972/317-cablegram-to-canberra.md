# 317 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Paris, 13 March 1972

1124.Secret

****

China

There is still no reply from the PRC Ambassador1 although he had today 13 March his first meeting with the American Ambassador. I am beginning to wonder whether in fact there will ever be a reply other than what may be this indirect negative.

2\. Should I keep on seeking an appointment?

Renouf.
