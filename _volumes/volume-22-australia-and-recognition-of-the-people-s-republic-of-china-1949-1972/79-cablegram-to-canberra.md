# 79 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Washington, 10 June 1959

1284\. Secret Personal

For Casey from Beale.1

Your telegram 739.2

1\. The Prime Minister’s discussions in Washington3 were overshadowed by Dulles’ death and funeral and his talks with the President and Herter4 were very general.

2\. In the interview with the President the question of the recognition of China came up and the President declared that in view of the inhuman behaviour of the Chinese Communists the United States Government would not recognise the Peking regime as long as he remained President. He went on to say that if of course their behaviour improved and they became entitled to recognition as a civilised member of the world community the question could be reviewed. He made it clear however that he did not regard this as a likely possibility in the foreseeable future. The Prime Minister said that the question of the recognition of Communist China could not be regarded simply as a juridical one. It was essentially political and the effect of recognition on the overseas Chinese and free countries of Asia had to be carefully considered. (The discussion was not pursued but the implication of the Prime Minister’s remark was that he agreed with the President that it would be unwise to accord recognition at the present time.)
