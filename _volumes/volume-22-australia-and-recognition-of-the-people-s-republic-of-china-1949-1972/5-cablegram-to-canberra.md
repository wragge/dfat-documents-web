# 5 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Nanking, 23 December 1949

Unnumbered Top Secret Immediate

From Clark.1

Your message 115 of 21st December.2

1\. In the event of Australia _not_ recognizing the Communist Government in China at the same time as other members of the Commonwealth, Australian representatives in China may be expected to receive even worse treatment’ than Americans who are anticipating trouble and removing all surplus personnel.

2\. Following repercussions may be expected—

(a) I seriously doubt if even unofficial contacts with local Communists will be possible.

(b) Unfavourable Press comments mainly on the lines of Australia being nothing but ‘running financial (rest of quotation corrupt)’ revival of a certain ranting [against?]3 our White Australia policy.

(c) We may well expect such incidents as happened to Ward and other Americans in Manchuria4 with possible eviction.

3\. Should Canada offer recognition and _not_ Australia, Australia’s attitude will be regarded as a result of Australia’s hatred of Chinese people and coloured races personnel generally.

4\. Non–recognition would seriously prejudice future Australian trade with China which has great possibilities as soon as the Communist Government commences reconstruction.

5\. Even a short delay after recognition5 is likely to build up a feeling of distrust which will render trade relations most difficult.

1 Col. A.G. Clark, Australian Military Attaché, Nanking.

2 It explained that the United Kingdom, India, South Africa, and perhaps other Commonwealth countries might accord recognition well before Australia would do so. Clark was asked to be prepared for such a situation, and to urgently cable his views on the position that would pertain to Australian representatives and nationals in Shanghai and Nanking.

3 A word appears to have been missing in the original.

4 See footnote 2, Document 2.

5 Apparently, reference here to recognition is intended to denote recognition by other Commonwealth countries.
