# 276 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

China Representation

Your 11831 and our 8462.

We spoke to Newlin again this morning about fall–back positions emphasising that we were determined not to relax in any way our efforts to have our resolution succeed but that we should be ready to meet any contingency in the event that they failed.

2\. On the basis of course that fall–back positions would be discussed strictly among the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan only, Newlin accepted this and confirmed that the Americans are now applying their minds to devising the most effective approach.

3\. However, Newlin made the points that:

(i) We could not f[o]resee in detail an possible contingencies especially since inter alia we would not know in advance just what tactics our opponents might use,

(ii) Therefore, any agreed fall–back positions and instructions to delegations would need to have some flexibility. Delegations would need to have some discretion to adapt instructions at short notice to new and unforeseen situations as they emerged.

4\. We acknowledged the wisdom of flexibility but put it in the context that we attached considerable importance to harmonising to the full extent possible both our attitude to the most effective tactics and our voting on particular proposals.

5\. We shall continue to pursue these matters and report as appropriate.
