# 370 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Paris, 13 December 1972

5767\. Secret Priority

****

China Recognition

Assuming it proves possible to reach agreement on the text of the communique at the next meeting (which should be Thursday or Friday), what date would you wish the communique to bear? Or in other words when would you want signature to occur?
