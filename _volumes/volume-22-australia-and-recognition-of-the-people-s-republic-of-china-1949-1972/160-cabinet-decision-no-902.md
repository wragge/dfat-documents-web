# 160 CABINET DECISION NO. 902

Canberra, 23 February 1971

Secret

**Submission No. 678—Australia’s Policy Towards China1**

The Cabinet took up a first consideration of the issues in the Submission and expressed its position as follows:—

(a) It accepted:—

(i) that for the reasons argued in the Submission, the People’s Republic of China is likely soon to be admitted into the United Nations with the permanent seat of China in the Security Council; and

(ii) that, also for the reasons argued, the implications of this likely development call for a reappraisal of Australia’s policy towards China.

It should be Australian policy that the interests of the people of Taiwan be upheld and that Taiwan should be preserved as a separate entity and as a member of the United Nations if it so desires.

2\. The Cabinet noted that United States officials would arrive in Canberra later in the week for purposes including consultation on the international role of Communist China and the question of Chinese representation in the United Nations. It authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for views to be exchanged with this mission on 1 (a) and (b) above—it being understood that the Cabinet would receive a report on the discussions with the mission and if desirable would be further consulted during the course of the discussions.

3\. The Cabinet expressly indicated that its present decision is limited to the above and that it is not to be taken as having dealt with recommendations 2 to 7 of paragraph 203 of the Submission.

4\. By way of general reaction surrounding its decision, the Cabinet acknowledged that its approach must be practical and linked to the realities of the situation, including the risks of Australia being isolated or exposed internationally in its attitude to the People’s Republic of China. But at the same time it felt that Australia should proceed in a careful way step by step with the Cabinet assessing the position at each point. It saw the discussions with the United States as a first step whereby opportunity would be taken to ascertain the current state of thinking of the United States on the whole matter. It would in due course in the light of this consider further Australia’s own position and tactics. It would wish at all times to maintain close concert with the United States in particular.
