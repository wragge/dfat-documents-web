# 89 CABINET DECISION NO. 1245

Melbourne, 2 March 1961

Confidential

**Without Memorandum—Wheat Sales on Terms to Mainland China**

1\. The Minister for Trade informed the Cabinet that the Wheat Board had received advice from the China Resources Committee1 that it wishes to buy up to an additional one million tons of wheat from Australia during the current year. Mainland China also envisages the purchase of one million tons of Australian wheat per annum in the next two years, and is seeking six to twelve months credit terms on all future purchases.

2\. The Cabinet decided that there would be no political objection to the sale of wheat to Mainland China on terms which could be regarded as commercial.2
