# 211 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Washington, 16 July 1971

3817\. Confidential Eclipse

**President’s Proposed Visit to China**

Although Kissinger’s visit to China must have been very carefully prepared in advance, knowledge of it was very severely restricted. None of our usual State Department contacts, including senior officers working in the China field, had any inkling of it until shortly before statement was made. Our Pentagon contacts were in similar position: Indeed, the general assumption was that, if President’s topic was in international affairs area, it was most likely to relate to Vietnam.

2\. President’s statement last night therefore came as a considerable surprise.1State Department officers have strict instructions to neither comment nor speculate on matter, and it is therefore difficult for us to provide any comments at this stage based on official thinking.

3\. However, soundings we have taken with our usual working level contacts in fields relating to China indicate a general sense of gratification in State Department, though there is some realisation that problems could be posed for other countries.

4\. It has been confirmed to us by an officer who was present that formal ROC reaction (delivered by Ambassador Shen to Assistant Secretary Marshall Green today) was very strong indeed. Shen later told press here that President’s announcement ‘is not the kind of thing a friend and ally should do without prior consultation or sufficient notice’. He said decision ‘is a blow to us and affects our vital interests. I can expect a very difficult period ahead although we still consider the United States a friend and ally’. Shen said that he received twenty minutes notice of announcement.

5\. It is still rather soon to assess public reactions. However, early press reports suggest significant Congressional support for President’s action. (Summary following by separate cable).2 Common thread running through many comments is favourable impact development may have on Vietnam engagement.

6\. We understand Holdridge (who is responsible for Asian Affairs on Kissinger’s staff and who is a China expert) accompanied Kissinger to Peking. We have an appointment to see him on 19 July, but we would not expect him to be very forthcoming at this stage.
