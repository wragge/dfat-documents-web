1Documents 376 to 378 were evidently sent as a batch; they have, therefore, been organised in this volume according to their substantive content, rather than the order in which they were dispatched or numbered. With regard to the latter, the three documents were renumbered by hand on the originals—the second digit of each being correctly changed from a ‘3’ to a ‘2’ .

2 Documents 373 and 374.

3 Document 347.
