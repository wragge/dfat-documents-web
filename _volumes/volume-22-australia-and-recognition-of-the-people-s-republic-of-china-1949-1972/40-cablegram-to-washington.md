# 40 CABLEGRAM TO WASHINGTON

Canberra, 13 June 1953

470\. Secret Immediate

For Ambassador from Minister.

**Korea—Post Armistice Programme**

[_matter omitted_]

7\. So far as discussion of matters other than Korea in Political Conference itself is concerned, I would hope that, in any event, we could avoid any commitment just now to discuss other Far Eastern problems. The United Kingdom seems to feel that, while Korean questions must have first priority, the Conference might then go on to consider Chinese representation in the United Nations and Formosa. I do not rule out possibility that discussion of these matters could flow from a successful Conference on Korean matters, but Americans are unlikely to accept this at the outset, and if they did accept it, there might be Congressional and public criticism in the United States which would tie hands of the Americans at Political Conference.
