# 372 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Taipei, 14 December 1972

817\. Secret Priority

****

Relations with the ROC

Premier Chiang asked me to call at short notice on 14 December. The atmosphere was cordial. Much of the conversation was personal.

2\. I said I appreciated the chance to say farewell personally and to pass our good wishes to Mrs Chiang. I felt rather like the captain of a sinking ship leaving before his crew. However, I knew that my crew would be well cared for and helped after my departure (our telegram 8021 refers). Chiang nodded.

3\. Matters of substance touched on were as follows:—

(a) Chiang had decided two days ago that the Bank of China branch inAustralia should be withdrawn. It was the only sensible thing to do. I thoughtthat decision would be appreciated.

(b) He had decided, and passed me a message to say, that trade with Australia should continue. (No reference was made to any other aspects such as travel or cultural relations.) I thought that would be to our mutual benefit. I mentioned my talk with Tsai the previous night2 (but I am not certain whether Chiang had had a report on it). He agreed that, having agreed in principle that trade should continue, it could be left open to work out details later. It would obviously be more difficult to communicate after the break in relations but it would not be impossible.

(c) Chiang made a particular point of saying that he hoped we would not let the PRC harass overseas Chinese in Australia who wished to retain ties with Taiwan. I said that I had twice reported the Foreign Ministry as making this request. I would certainly bring it up in discussions in Canberra. I thought there would be no illusions about the activities the PRC might undertake in the Chinese community there. Many were Australian citizens whom we ourselves would not wish ‘harassed’ . Chiang said that there were many Chinese living in Australia who were not Australian citizens. They could need some protection.

1 13 December. Dunn stressed that it would be advisable to give the ROC advance notice of the date and formula of recognition of the PRC in that it would aid a request for assurances that Embassy staff and property would be protected. He stated that trouble was not expected, but that a formal request would nevertheless be desirable.
