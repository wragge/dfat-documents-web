Draft DR _resolution_.

DRAFT DR RESOLUTION.

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled ‘the representation of China in the United Nations,’

Noting that since the founding of the United Nations, fundamental changes have occurred in China,

Having regard for the existing factual situation,

Noting that the Republic of China has been continuously represented as a member of the United Nations since 1945,

Believing that the People’s Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations,

Recalling that Article 1, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations establishes the United Nations as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations,

Taking into account the general sentiment of member states, which found expression in the final declaration of the 25th Anniversary of the United Nations, that universality of membership in the United Nations should be realized,

Believing that an equitable resolution of this problem should be sought in the light of the above mentioned considerations and without prejudice to the eventual settlement of the conflicting claims involved,

1\. Hereby affirms the right of representation of the People’s Republic of China,

2\. Affirms the continued right of representation of the Republic of China,

3\. Recommends, in accordance with Article 102 and General Assembly Resolution 396/(V) (14 December 1950)3, that the specialized agencies take into account the provisions of this resolution in deciding the question of Chinese representation in those organs and agencies.

1 Document 228.

2 Article 10 of the UN Charter states that the General Assembly ‘may discuss any questions or matters within the scope of the present Charter or relating to the powers and functions of any organs provided for in the present Charter, and, ... may make recommendations to the Members of the United Nations or to the Security Council or to both on any such questions or matters’.

3 This resolution recommended that, whenever more than one authority claimed to be the Government entitled to represent a member state in the United Nations, and when this proved controversial, the question should be considered in the light of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the circumstances of each case; that any such question should be considered by the General Assembly, or by the Interim Committee if the General Assembly was not in session; that the attitude adopted should be taken into account in other organisations of the United Nations and in the specialised agencies; it declared that the attitude adopted by the General Assembly or its Interim Committee concerning such questions should not of itself affect the direct relations of individual member states with the state concerned; and requested the Secretary–General to transmit the resolution to other organs of the United Nations and the specialised agencies.
