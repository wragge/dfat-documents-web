# 207 LETTER FROM APPLING TO McMAHON

Canberra, 14 July 1971

Secret

I have been instructed to deliver to you urgently the following message from President Nixon:

‘Dear Mr. Prime Minister:

Thank you for your letter of May 13, 1971,2 concerning the China policies of our two governments, particularly as they relate to Chinese representation in the United Nations. I also appreciated receiving earlier the preliminary analysis of the Chinese representation issue prepared by your Department of Foreign Affairs3 and members of my government are studying it as we proceed with our own analysis.

At present we are in the midst of consultations with a number of countries including your government, and I am sure that Ambassador Plimsoll has conveyed to you our tentative thinking on how to approach this question in the upcoming session of the General Assembly. As soon as we have completed these discussions, we will be taking a final look at the problem, and I will expect to announce my decision probably some time in the latter half of July. Prior to this announcement, I will plan to be in touch with you through Ambassador Plimsoll as to the substance of the decision.

This has been a particularly complicated problem to deal with, and I have appreciated your thoughts on it and cooperation in handling it. I recognize the need for moving with all deliberate speed, and look forward to working with you as we make the final preparation for the General Assembly session.

With best wishes, Sincerely, (signed) Richard Nixon’
