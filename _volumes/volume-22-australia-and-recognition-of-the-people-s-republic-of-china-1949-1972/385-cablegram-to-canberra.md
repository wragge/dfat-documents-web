PRC/Australia and New Zealand Diplomatic Relations

Our telegram 18591

NCNA reported on 22 December the full texts of the Australian and New Zealand communiques establishing diplomatic relations and carried as well a New Zealand Foreign Ministry statement saying that New Zealand’s diplomatic relations with Taiwan had been terminated as from the date of the New Zealand communique (22 December).

On 24 December NCNA, received today, published a ‘People’s Daily’ editorial welcoming the establishment of diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand.

Full text as follows:—

Begins

After friendly negotiations, the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand announced separately on December 22, 1972 the establishment of diplomatic relations. This important development in the relations between China and the two countries conforms to the interests and common desire of the peoples of all three countries. We warmly welcome this.

The Chinese Government has consistently maintained that the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non–aggression, non–interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be a criteria for handling relations among nations. We have, precisely on the basis of these principles, established diplomatic relations with more than 80 countries. China’s establishment of diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand has added a new chapter in the relations between China and Oceania.

The labour parties of Australia and New Zealand had long opted for the recognition of the People’s Republic of China and supported the restoration to China of her legitimate position in the United Nations. After corning to power through their victories in the latest general elections, the two parties adopted a positive approach and steps in promoting the normalization of relations between China and the two countries. In the joint communiques on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Australia and New Zealand, both the Australian and the New Zealand Governments have explicitly recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government on China, and recognized the stand of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China. We appreciate this attitude of the Australian and New Zealand Governments.

The Australian Labor Government has announced the withdrawal of Australian military personnel from South Viet Nam and expressed its support to applying economic sanctions against the racialist and colonialist regimes of Rhodesia, South Africa and Portugal. The New Zealand Labour Government has also announced the withdrawal of the remaining New Zealand troops from South Viet N am and indicated that military commitments will no longer be undertaken in South VietNam. The two Governments have also expressed strong opposition to the US imperialist wanton bombing of the Democratic Republic of VietNam. All this has reflected the will and desire of the Australian and New Zealand Governments to pursue an independent foreign policy. This complies with the current trend in the world and conforms to the interests of the people of Australia and New Zealand.

Friendly intercourse has existed all the time between the Chinese people and the people of Australia and New Zealand. Overseas Chinese went to these two Oceanian countries long, long ago after crossing oceans where they had formed a profound friendship with the local people through working and living together. The friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of Australia and New Zealand have developed steadily since the founding of the People’s Republic of China. In July 1971, the delegation of the Australian Labor Party headed by Mr Edward Gough Whitlam visited our country and made contribution to the promotion of the normalization of relations between China and Australia. An Australian table tennis delegation visited our country in April 1971 and a Chinese table tennis delegation paid a friendly visit to Australia and New Zealand last July and August. All this has enhanced understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Australia and New Zealand.

The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Australia and New Zealand now has opened up bright prospects to friendly cooperation and interflow of personnel in trade, culture, science and technology and other spheres. We are convinced that the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Australia and New Zealand and the other Oceanian people will certainly grow and deepen.

Ends.

Editorial continues approving line towards the Australian Government’s policies which are seen as a break with the past. We note, however, that English text of ‘People’s Daily’ employs the phrase ‘recognised the stand of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the PRC’ . We have not yet seen Chinese text of communique but it appears from the editorial that their version may employ an expression which can be translated as ‘recognises’ or ‘acknowledges’ . You will recall that this was the treatment given the British formula last year.

In other respects also the editorial strikes a positive note.
