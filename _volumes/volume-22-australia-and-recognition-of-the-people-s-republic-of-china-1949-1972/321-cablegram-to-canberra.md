# 321 CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA

Paris, 17 March 1972

1212\. Secret

****

China

It is now ten days since I asked for an early appointment with the Chinese Ambassador. There has not been any reply although the Ambassador has been in Paris and at work.

* 2\. As time goes by, it is becoming clearer that silence is the only reaction we can expect, that is to say that the Chinese are not (repeat not) prepared, at least at this time, to accord Australia the same treatment as they have accorded the United States.

Renouf.
