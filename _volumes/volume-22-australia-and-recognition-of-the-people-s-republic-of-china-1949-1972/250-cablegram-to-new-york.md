# 250 CABLEGRAM TO NEW YORK

Canberra, 2 September 1971

881\. Secret Priority

****

Chinese Representation

Our 865,1 paragraph 4 refers.

If you think it might be useful, please discuss with the Americans following possible amendments to the AR. We do not want them however to be known as ‘Australian’ amendments.

(a) In the second preambular paragraph of the AR replace the words ‘restoration of the lawful rights’ by the word ‘representation’,

(b) Replace the third preambular paragraph by the following:  
'Accepting the representatives of the Government of the People’s Republic of China as representatives of China to the United Nations and the People’s Republic of China as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council’,

(c) In the operative paragraph, replace the words after (under-line) ‘decides to’ by the following:  
‘accept the representatives of the People’s Republic of China as representatives of China to the United Nations and in the Security Council’.

2\. These amendments would, of course, be linked with an IQ variation or Non–Expulsion resolution. They are not the only possible amendments but indicate the sort of amendments which might achieve our objectives.

3\. Our comments on the texts of the two American draft resolutions are contained in the following: our 767,2 submissions to Minister of 3rd August3 (paragraph 4) and 13th August4 (paragraph 11), our 8455(paragraph 2 (C)) and our 865 (paragraph 2).
