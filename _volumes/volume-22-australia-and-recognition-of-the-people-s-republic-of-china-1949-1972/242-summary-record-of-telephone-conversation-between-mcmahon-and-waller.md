# 242 SUMMARY RECORD OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN McMAHON AND WALLER

Canberra, 19 August 1971

Secret

(The Prime Minister rang the secretary in connection with UN New York’s 608).1

_The Prime Minister_ asked why we are not co–sponsoring the American resolutions.

_The Secretary_ said we have not yet been asked to do so. There were still no firm texts. We had been asked only to co–sponsor the inscription of a new item. But the Americans then decided to do that alone.

_The Prime Minister_ said we should stand by our friends. He asked why we were timorous.

_The Secretary_ expressed the belief that we should take a long-term view.

_The Prime Minister_ said he believed we should support the Americans.

FOOT NOTE

Dr. Cumes told the Secretary that we had not turned our faces against co–sponsorship. We wanted not to be isolated. We would be prepared to join with a large and representative group. The Americans themselves had said they wanted to avoid the impression of collusion with Japan on inscription; they therefore had sponsored alone.
