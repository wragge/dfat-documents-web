# 367 CABLEGRAM TO TAIPEI

Canberra, 13 December 1972

834\. Secret Immediate

For Dunn and Godfrey–Smith only

Relations with ROC

Renouf has informed the Chinese Ambassador in Paris on instructions:

(a) That we will not establish an office of the Australian Government in Taipei nor allow the Taiwan authorities to establish an office in Australia.

(b) That we have a substantial volume of trade with Taiwan which will continue under private arrangements.

2\. We do not therefore intend establishing in Taipei, or allowing the Taiwan authorities to establish in Australia, any office which could be represented as having any governmental or official character or connections whatsoever. Inter alia, (underline two) this would preclude the Taiwan authorities from leaving behind any people from their Embassy or Consulates in Australia. We have in mind, if need be, that a private Australian company in Taipei might answer trade enquiries and perhaps undertake some other trade promotion functions, and that a private Taiwanese firm might carry out similar activities here—but our thinking has not yet developed sufficiently to warrant any discussion with the ROC authorities.

3\. Please inform the ROC authorities of the foregoing immediately.
