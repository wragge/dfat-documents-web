# 15 CABLEGRAM TO OTTAWA

Canberra, 2 March 1950

5\. Secret

For Pearson from Spender.1

I agree that it would be most fortunate if both our Governments could act together. I agree also that United States policy is only one factor. I have informed the State Department that we would not alter our decision without first informing the United States Government.

2\. You will appreciate that there is current a legislative session and included in pending legislation is an Act directed against the Communist movement.2 While there is no real inconsistency between this and recognition of China, the two would be related in the minds of people in Australia and it is desirable to postpone recognition until after that legislation is past all stages. The end of. March may be too early from this point of view.

3\. I am taking the liberty of communicating the substance of your message to the Minister for External Affairs, Wellington, together with the substance of this reply,3 and, subject to your concurrence, would communicate the substance of the messages to the Prime Minister of South Africa, as it would be most desirable for all four countries to act together in this matter.

4\. As already indicated, I am, of course, in close touch with the United States Ambassador,4 but any information which you can give after he meets Jessup would be appreciated. Regards.

1 Spender was replying to Pearson’s message contained in Document 14.

2 The Australian Liberal–Country Party Coalition had promised to ban the Communist Party during the election campaign of 1949, and in April it brought to Parliament draft legislation under the name of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill.

3 Doidge replied on 9 March that he had not yet discussed the timing of recognition with the New Zealand Cabinet He continued: ‘My own view, however, is that we should be in no hurry to recognise, though I do see the advantages in several of the Dominions acting concurrently at some future date’.
