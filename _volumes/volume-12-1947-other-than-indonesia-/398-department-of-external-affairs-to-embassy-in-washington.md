# 398 Department of External Affairs to Embassy in Washington

Cablegram 723 CANBERRA, 23 June 1947, 6.30 P.m. [1]

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Further to our Washington 717. [2] Japanese Whaling.

1\. Confirming telephone conversation it is desired that the Ambassador make immediate protest to the State Department against the decision announced from Tokyo, despite the fact that as you have explained by telephone it was arrived at after our alternative proposal had been made officially and at a time when it was apparently under active consideration.

2\. Please keep in close touch with United Kingdom Embassy and endeavour to obtain their support also New Zealand for this protest, and also in F.E. C. discussion on Japanese whaling on Thursday next.

3\. In F.E.C. follow lines indicated in paragraph 3 of our telegram under reference[3], and take strong attitude along lines of paragraph 1 above. We rely on you to obtain maximum support to ensure that there is (a) disapproval in principle of continuation by Japanese of whaling industry in Antarctica and in any event (b) approval of principle implied in Australian proposal viz. that Allies themselves be given all rights of operating any emergency expedition for purpose of obtaining oil and food to be allocated by F.E.C. or I.E.F.C. [4] or S.C.A.P., it being guaranteed that there will be strict observance of international whaling convention.

4\. In view importance and urgency of matter Plimsoll's departure could be postponed until next plane after Thursday's meeting. [5]

4 International Emergency Food Council.
