# 321 Department of External Affairs to Embassy in Washington

Cablegram 637 CANBERRA, 2 June 1947

IMMEDIATE SECRET

It is now highly probable that British Commonwealth Conference will take place in Canberra in August to discuss Japanese Settlement and related matters. Policy on F.E.C. should be to retard pace as much as possible, have fewer meetings, and delay final decisions at any rate until after British Commonwealth meeting.
