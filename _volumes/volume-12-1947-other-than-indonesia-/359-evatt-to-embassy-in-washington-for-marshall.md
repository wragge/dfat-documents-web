# 359 Evatt to Embassy in Washington for Marshall

Cablegram 1051 CANBERRA, 31 August 1947, 10.15 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Please convey the following message to Marshall from Minister:-

Begins: A short meeting at a governmental level during the early part of the Assembly would, in my view, be suitable providing matter is then pressed forward.

I am sending to Ambassador Butler confidential report concerning present British Commonwealth discussions on Japanese settlement so that he may communicate it to yourself. I am happy to advise you that discussions have revealed not only that all Governments are approaching the subject along parallel lines, but also in the way in which I believe your Government would fully approve in principle.

I am leaving Australia for the United States on Thursday next. I am looking forward to seeing you in New York where I can give you a full report and I hope to have the honour of working with you to achieve a speedy, just and stable settlement.

Personal regards.

Ends.
