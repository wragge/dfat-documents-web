# 331 Evatt to Chifley

## Letter CANBERRA, 1 July 1947

I think the time has arrived when it might be helpful for me to establish an Advisory Committee on the proposed Japanese Settlement.

As I suggested in the House, the Advisory Committee would best be a mixed one, i.e. including Members of Parliament and other persons with special knowledge of the subject.

Because of his training and experience, I am proposing to ask Sir Frederic Eggleston to chair the Committee. He has already been chairing a Departmental Committee which has worked for some time on this subject and which has already prepared one draft, submitted to Cabinet in Agendum No. 1341.

I propose to invite the following persons to join the Committee:-

Parliamentary Members:

Mr. K. E. Beazley, M.P.

Mr. T. Sheehan, M.P.

The Hon. A. McK. McDonald, M.P.

Mr. B.H. Corset, M.P.

Senator Dorothy M. Tangney Senator W. J. Cooper, M.B.E. [1]

Others:

The Hon. Sir Frederic Eggleston (Chairman) Professor K. H. Bailey (Vice-Chairman) Brigadier A. S. Blackburn, V.C., LL.B. (S.A.) The Hon. P. J. Clarey, M.L.C. (Vic.) Miss Constance Duncan, M.A. (Vic.) Mr. P. R. Wilkins (A.C.T.) Lieut.-General Sir Leslie Morshead, K.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., E.D.

(N.S.W.) Professor A. H. McDonald (N.S.W.) Mr. R. J. F. Boyer, M.A. (N.S.W.) Professor A. L. Sadler, M.A. (N.S.W.) Sir Douglas Mawson, O.B.E., F.R.S., D.Sc., B.E. (S.A.) [2]

If you approve, I would propose to invite the Members of Parliament concerned and to inform the respective Leaders of the United Australia Party and the Country Party.

Any further suggestions from yourself would be appreciated. [3]
