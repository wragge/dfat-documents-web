# 38 Chifley to Evatt

## Cablegram E46 CANBERRA, 2 0ctober 1947, 11.20 a.m.

At last Cabinet meeting it was noted that the United Nations requirement for the expulsion of Spain from specialised agencies must have a detrimental effect on the work of those agencies. You are of course aware of the difficulty created at the first Assembly of I.C.A.O. in expulsion of Spain and it is certainly anomalous that Spain is not permitted to belong to this technical body (one of the prime objectives of which is to achieve standardisation and safety in air transport) although member States do in fact have airlines operating to and through Spanish territory. I would like you to bear these disabilities in mind and consider whether an appropriate opportunity could be taken to bring about a change that would permit technical organisations such as I.C.A.O. to achieve the widest possible membership.
