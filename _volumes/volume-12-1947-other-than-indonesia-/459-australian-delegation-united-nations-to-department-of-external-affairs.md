# 459 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN254 NEW YORK, 12 March 1947, 7.27 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Security 300.

1\. When the Council resumed debate on Japanese mandates today it had before it a cablegram from New Zealand requesting- (a) New Zealand participation in discussions, and (b) Participation by Netherlands, Canada, India and Philippines if they so desire.

As a result of our further discussions with Mudaliar [1], the Indian Liaison Officer at United Nations Headquarters also presented a letter requesting Indian participation.

2\. The United States freely assented to New Zealand and Indian participation although declaring that it did not assent to the reason stated by New Zealand, namely 'that disposition made for these islands is an essential part of any plan for the control of Japan and the peace settlement with that country' and was, therefore, 'a matter of interest to those states who took an active part in the war against Japan'. While denying that other states named were necessarily interested, the United States stated that if they requested to be heard within a reasonable time it would join in inviting them.

3\. Australia briefly supported the United States proposal to invite New Zealand and India and expressed concurrence with the view that if others applied they should also be invited.

4\. The Council agreed to invite New Zealand and India and expressed willingness to admit other states if they apply and instructed secretariat to ask Governments to send duly accredited representatives.

5\. The President [2] then proposed adjournment. We formally lodged the Australian amendments [3] and United Kingdom lodged the amendments given in our Security 302. The President refused to allow any further discussion.

6\. The debate will be resumed next Monday.

1 Sir A. Ramaswami Mudaliar, President of the UN Economic and Social Council.
