# 492 Chifley to Ball

Cablegram 459 CANBERRA, 4 August 1947

TOP SECRET MOST IMMEDIATE

I have carefully read your two messages. I have received a message from Dr. Evatt as you implied. Having considered the matter, I would like you to remain, carrying on your normal duties until the Minister returns to Canberra on 15th August, when I shall discuss with him the whole matter and, in particular, the desirability of your attending the British Commonwealth Conference. I shall then communicate with you again. I hope that you will fall in with this arrangement. [1]
