# 539 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram UN1048 NEW YORK, 29 0ctober 1947, 11.22 p.m.

SBCRET

1\. Political Committee 29th October discussed Soviet Resolution that Committee 'invite elected Representatives of the Korean people from Northern and Southern Korea to take part in the discussion of the question.' 2. Gromyko said vital interests of Korean people should not be discussed in absence of their Representatives. Quoted example of invitation of Jews and Arabs to attend Palestine Committee, and 'strange phenomenon' of difficulties always raised against representation [at] United Nations of peoples who were struggling for freedom, e.g. Indonesians. Fundamental difference between United States and Soviet proposal was that former called for all measures to accomplish Korean independence being taken before withdrawal of troops, whereas latter called for withdrawal first to enable Korean people to settle their problems independently.

3\. Dr. Evatt pointed out that Soviet and United States proposals both contemplated withdrawal of troops and self-government, and therefore it would be preferable for the two powers to make further attempt at agreement. He was, however, opposed to more delay, which would be caused if Representatives of Korean people were to be chosen and brought to New York. It would be a serious matter nevertheless to reject Soviet proposal outright. Some form of Korean consultation should take place. United Nations Commission on the spot would be best authority to consult with Koreans, who were entitled to hearing.

4\. Dulles (U.S.A.) then proposed amendment to Soviet Resolution providing that Koreans participate in consideration of matter and that 'in order to facilitate and expedite such participation and to ensure that the Korean Representatives will in fact be duly elected by the Korean people and not mere appointees from Military authorities in Korea, there be forthwith established a United Nations Temporary Commission Korea, to be [1] in Korea with right to travel, observe and consult throughout Korea'.

5\. Dulles said his amendment accepted Soviet resolution that United Nations could deal with Korea and also Soviet position that question could not be settled without consultation between United Nations and true Representatives of Korean people. Soviet suggestion, however, was impractical as it would be impossible to hear in New York Representatives of approximately 500 political parties and social organisations. Best method would be for United Nations Commission for Korea to deal with thorny problem. Dulles pointed out question of selecting Representative Koreans had nullified efforts of Joint Commission and similar difficulty would confront United Nations Committee if Soviet Resolution were adopted.

6\. France also urged United States and U.S.S.R. make further effort to reach understanding. Agreed with principle of sending United Nations Commission to Korea but stated that, in voting on United States Amendment, France would abstain because the Committee was running risk of taking decision at this early stage on question of substance when Soviet Resolution was rather question of procedure.

7\. Wellington Koo made a rather confused speech. He supported proposal for Korean participation provided Koreans represented Korea as a whole. In view of 'extraordinary' situation, however, China thought that best method of implementation of consultation would be by means of United Nations Commission on the spot. China therefore supported United States amendment after proposing deletion of words, 'from Northern and Southern Korea'.

8\. Gromyko opposed United States amendment, and charged that United States were 'afraid' to have Representatives of Korea present.

9\. Dr. Evatt warned again of interminable delays if Korean Representatives come to New York, and said that their presence at this stage was not necessary. International declarations already provided for independent, unitary Korea, and all Koreans were in agreement on this. Real need for Korean consultation would come in consideration of details and implementation, and this should take place with commission, as provided in United States amendment.

Australia considered Korean problem was part of Japanese Peace Settlement but had not insisted on this view to avoid delay.

10\. Other speakers during day were Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelo- Russia and Ukraine for Soviet Resolution. Canada, Belgium and Haiti against. Debate continues tomorrow.
