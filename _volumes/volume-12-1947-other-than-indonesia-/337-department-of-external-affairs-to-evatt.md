# 337 Department of External Affairs to Evatt

Cablegram 1 CANBERRA, 13 July 1947, 11.50 a.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

Three immediately following telegrams contain suggestion by United States for Peace Conference on Deputies level 19th August in United States of America.

We have sent telegrams United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand asking that no reply be made until we can communicate considered views and we have also communicated Australian Representatives France, Netherlands, China, Russia and India instructing them to ascertain preliminary reaction of these Governments and in doing so to suggest that while Australia has been the advocate of early settlement American attempt to stampede ten countries into making decisions on vital questions of procedure (such as level of representation and participation of countries outside F.E.C.) without opportunity for adequate consideration should be resisted.

Possible reply might be along lines of suggestion made to you recently for short initial session on Foreign Ministers' level immediately before General Assembly.
