# 157 Chifley to McFarlane

Cablegram 2984 CANBERRA, 17 July 1947

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Your airmail report of 9th July.

Your suggestion for an appropriately worded high level appeal from United Kingdom instead of an agreement containing assurances by Australia is a happy one. It has many psychological advantages.

The precise content of the letter of appeal, particularly the suggestion for Australian action, would of course be crucial both from the psychological and technical viewpoints and I assume that the appeal would NOT be made without my having approved beforehand the actual terms of the letter. This is vital.
