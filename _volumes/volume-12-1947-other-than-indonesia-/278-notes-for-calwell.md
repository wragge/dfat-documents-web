# 278 Notes for Calwell

[June 1947][1]

FOREIGN IMMIGRATION REVISED IMMIGRATION POLICY-1947

Australia having made its contribution to the solution of the problem of the displaced and persecuted peoples of Europe it is recommended that policy in respect of all aliens should be reorientated in the light of recent developments and the need to consider admissions purely from the immigration point of view, i.e. desirable types, rather than from the aspect of humanitarianism.

It is felt that generally the following guiding principles should be applied in determining the classes of persons to be granted permanent admission:

(a) Persons who by reason of their age and nationality and general qualifications would be likely to be readily assimilated.

(b) Persons who are skilled in trades or professions or who are fitted to engage in occupations, e.g. agriculture, hospital workers, in which there is a definite demand for labour.

(c) Persons who by reason of their special professional or technical qualifications could make a material contribution to the economic development of this country.

(d) Persons who could as a general rule be found accommodation without detriment to those already resident in Australia.

In the light of these principles the following revised policy for 1947 is submitted:

(A) United States Citizens No special conditions to apply to United States citizens of European descent.

(B) Citizens of European Continental Countries Persons of European origin may be granted landing permits subject to the following conditions:-

(a) They are skilled in a trade or profession or are deemed suitable for employment in occupations, e.g. farm workers, hospital workers etc. in which there is a shortage of labour and (i) are single persons or, if married, are prepared to come to Australia in the first instance without their wives and families;

and are in possession of at least 50 landing money for initial maintenance; or (ii) if married and they desire to bring their families with them, are in possession of 100 landing money for initial maintenance and can produce evidence that accommodation is available for them and their families in Australia.

(b) Persons who do not come within the classes mentioned in (a) above may be granted landing permits provided they are nominated by persons resident in 1 The document is undated. It was prepared for Calwell's overseas mission in June.

Australia who are in a position to accept responsibility for their accommodation and maintenance for a period of twelve months and are prepared to furnish guarantees to this effect.

(c) They possess special professional or technical qualifications which would enable them to make a material contribution to the economic development of this country and (i) are single persons or, if married, are prepared to come to Australia in the first instance without their wives and families;

and are in possession of at least 50 landing money for initial maintenance; or (ii) if married and they desire to bring their families with them, are in possession of 100 landing money for initial maintenance and can produce evidence that accommodation is available for their families in Australia.

(d) Persons in the categories indicated below who have been persecuted or displaced by Nazi or Fascist regimes on religious, racial or political grounds may be admitted to Australia under exemption for two years in the first instance provided that they- (i) are skilled in an undermanned trade or profession or are deemed suitable for employment in occupations in which there is a definite shortage of labour and (ii) are nominated by a person resident in Australia for at least 12 months.

In the case of married persons the nominator must be prepared to accept responsibility for the accommodation and maintenance of their nominee for a period of twelve months.

Other persons without nominators in Australia provided they otherwise are eligible under the above conditions and under the general rules will be admitted on personal selection by an immigration officer if single or if married are prepared to come in the first instance without their wives and families.

At the end of the period of their exemption they may be granted permanent admission if still following the occupation for which they were admitted, or other approved occupation, and are otherwise deemed suitable residents.

(e) (i) In the case of Italian nationals who are the wives, unmarried daughters or minor unmarried sons of residents of Australia they are nominated by their husbands or fathers who are suitable guarantors and in a position to maintain and accept responsibility for the accommodation of their nominees.

(ii) Applications by residents of Australia for the admission of Italian nationals who do not come within the classes set out in (i) may be considered on their individual merits subject to the production of satisfactory evidence that the nominees became co- belligerents or did not continue to oppose the allied forces after the surrender of Italy.

(iii) Applications by residents of Australia for the re-entry of Italian nationals who were previously in Australia as prisoners of war or internees may be considered on their merits provided that the nominees will be employed by the nominators in agricultural work without detriment to agricultural workers in Australia, there is no Security objection to their re-admission and the nominators are in a position to employ and provide accommodation for their nominees.

(f) (i) In the case of persons who are nationals or former nationals of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Roumania and Bulgaria but do not come within the classes mentioned in (d), and are the wives, unmarried daughters and unmarried minor sons of residents of Australia, they may be granted landing permits provided that the husband or father is a suitable guarantor and in a position to maintain and accept responsibility for the accommodation of his nominees.
