# 322 Evatt to Beasley

Cablegram 205 CANBERRA, 5 June 1947, 4.50 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 180. [1] The date set that is the week beginning 26th is nothing less than a breach of faith. Your own telegram clearly indicates the second week in August (see your 198, paragraph 3(b)). When accepting the proposal, we did not contemplate such a late date in August, but were working on the proposal (b) set out by McNeil. South Africa['s] attendance is a matter of indifference. We have received a telegram from South Africa stating that they are not interested in the Pacific Settlement.

1 Dispatched 3 June.

Beasley also reported that the UK Government intended to approach Canada and South Africa to ensure they were adequately represented, and that Addison personally felt it important that South Africa attend.
