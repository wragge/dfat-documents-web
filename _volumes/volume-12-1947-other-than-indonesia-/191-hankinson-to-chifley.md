# 191 Hankinson to Chifley

Letter 4 December 1947,

SECRET

With reference to your letter of the 6th January (A.Y.27/1/1) on the subject of the British Defence Committee in South East Asia the High Commissioner has been asked to let you know that the whole question of the work of this Committee has recently been under consideration by the United Kingdom Authorities and it has been agreed that the name of the Committee should be changed to 'the British Defence Co-ordination Committee-Far East'. Terms of Reference have also been agreed and I enclose a copy.

It will be noticed that the Terms of Reference embody provisions for continuing the practice of inviting representatives of Australia and New Zealand when questions affecting either country are under consideration (paragraph g). It has also been suggested that the United States should be invited to send an observer to meetings of the Committee on appropriate occasions. This is considered desirable by the United Kingdom authorities, provided that the Australian and New Zealand Governments concur. We have been asked to ascertain the views of the Australian authorities on this suggestion. [1]
