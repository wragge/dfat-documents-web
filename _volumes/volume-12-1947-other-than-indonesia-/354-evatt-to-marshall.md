# 354 Evatt to Marshall

Cablegram 1031 CANBERRA, 26 August 1947, 10.15 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET PERSONAL

Canberra Conference on Japanese Settlement commenced today and I believe I am interpreting views of all members of British Commonwealth correctly in saying that we consider every endeavour should be made to press forward to achieve preliminary discussions on terms of Japanese settlement between representatives at Governmental level not later than September. There is also strong support for United States proposals on voting.
