# 52 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

## Cablegram 21 CANBERRA, 14 January 1947, 12 noon.

Disarmament.

Your UN29 and 30. Line you are following is in accord with our policy on this matter, and resolution suggested can be put forward at Wednesday's meeting in endeavour to combine United States and Soviet viewpoints. You should stress that this is the objective of Australian intervention at this stage.

2\. We feel that one of the factors holding up Soviet co-operation on the atomic side may be a fear that the Council may become side- tracked by the setting up of too many commissions along the lines of the Atomic Energy Commission. When presenting the Australia[n] resolution, therefore, you should point out that primary responsibility for co-ordination and broad policy aspects must rest with the Council, only the detailed planning resting with the commissions where the veto would, as agreed by Soviet at the Assembly, not apply.

3\. In the interests of concise presentation paragraphs 3 and 4 of your resolution should be amalgamated. Each paragraph then comprises the directions of the Council to its subsidiary organs.

4\. It is desirable that time limits for working out proposals with despatch should be fixed and adhered to.
