# 485 Evatt to Chifley

Cablegram unnumbered TOKYO, 28 July 1947, 9.30 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL SECRET

I have already had several talks with General MacArthur and on the whole with very satisfactory results. Reception by him was more than cordial and I think he will visit us in Australia next year in accordance with your invitation which I renewed in your name.
