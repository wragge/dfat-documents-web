# 462 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

## Cablegram 159 CANBERRA, 16 March 1947

Your UN225 [1] and UN265.

1\. We consider the United Kingdom arguments especially paragraph 3(d) absolutely sound. United States should be made to realize privately what their move would mean. It seems to us, two, not one extra members would be required for Council and Council would not be legally constituted at forthcoming meeting.

2\. In circumstances we suggest joint United Kingdom - Australian amendment. Our text is preferable amended to read 'this agreement will enter into force on the date on which the interim or final treaty of peace between Japan and the Allied powers victorious in the war against Japan becomes binding on Japan, it being understood etc.,' 3. However, if this not acceptable to United Kingdom, we would accept a joint resolution along lines of United Kingdom draft.

4\. We note both New Zealand and United Kingdom oppose Article 8(1) [2], but in circumstances you should support.

1 Presumably this should read UN255.

2 See note 2 to Document 458.
