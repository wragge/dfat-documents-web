# 451 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN150 NEW YORK, 14 February 1947, 8.39 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Security 266.

Your UNY.88.

1\. United States Delegation will probably lodge draft on Japanese Mandates early next week. Assuming some progress is made with A.E.C. Report [1] and Albanian case Council may commence consideration about twentieth but probably later.

2\. We understand confidentially that while United States of America is determined to state its case it would yield to majority view that Council approval of draft must await Japanese Peace Treaty. United Kingdom, whose views you know, is disinclined to lead opposition. If you wish Australia to do so we would appreciate text or guidance on statement to be made. We have received copies of more important papers.
