# 35 Cabinet Submission by Chifley and Chambers

## Agendum 1395 7 October 1947,

TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT FOR THE MANDATED TERRITORY OF NAURU

1\. By instrument dated 17th December, 1920, a mandate under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations was conferred upon His Britannic Majesty. The Governments of Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand on 2nd July, 1919, agreed upon arrangements for the administration of the territory and for the working of the phosphate deposits. The interests of the Pacific Phosphate Company were purchased by those Governments for the sum of 3,500,000 contributed in the proportions of 42%, 42% and 16% respectively. In agreement with the United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments, Australia has administered the Territory.

2\. At the General Assembly of the United Nations meeting in London in January 1946 the Australian Government announced 'its intention of negotiating an appropriate Trusteeship Agreement' with a view to bringing the mandated territory of Nauru under the international trusteeship system contemplated by Chapters XII and XIII of the United Nations Charter. This declaration was approved by Full Cabinet (Cabinet Agendum No. 1042 of 13th January 1946) and concurred in by the Governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

3\. The terms of an agreement to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly now in session have been under discussion for some time by representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. The terms of the final draft to which New Zealand and United Kingdom have expressed agreement are summarised as follows:

(a) full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction in and over the territory to be conferred on the administering authority which will be a joint authority composed of the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

(b) the Australian Government to be empowered to exercise with the approval of the Governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand and on behalf of the Joint Administering authority full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction in and over the territory.

(c) the administering authority to undertake to administer the territory in accordance with the obligations imposed by the United Nations Charter.

(d) the administering authority to have full power to take all measures it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory.

4\. The Administrator of Nauru and a representative of the British Phosphate Commissioners have been sent to new York to assist the Australian Delegation in the discussion of the draft agreement at the General Assembly.

5\. The United Nations Charter in Article 76(d), amongst other things, provides for equality of treatment for all members of the United Nations in economic matters. The question of the effect of this provision upon the existing rights of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, under the Agreement of 2nd July, 1919, to the exclusive use of phosphates of Nauru, to the extent of their requirements, has been carefully considered. It has been agreed between representatives of the three Governments that no reference should be made in the Trusteeship Agreement document to the Agreement between the three Governments. It is considered that any move to modify the existing rights of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the phosphate deposits of Nauru should be resisted. The Australian Delegation at the General Assembly should, therefore, be instructed not to agree to any amendment to the draft Agreement which would involve an alteration of the existing position in regard to the disposal of Nauru phosphate.

6\. It is recommended that the terms of the draft agreement attached be approved on the understanding set out in paragraph 5 of this submission. [1]
