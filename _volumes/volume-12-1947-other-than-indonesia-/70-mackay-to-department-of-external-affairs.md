I.L.O. Two.

A draft resolution submitted by the Government of India but not yet discussed requests the governing body- (a) To ascertain in consultation with the Governments and employers and workers organisations in industrially developed countries what maximum opportunities can be provided for training of Asian workers in skilled occupations and, (b) To draw up in consultation with Governments and employers and workers organisations in countries concerned a programme for systematic training of an adequate number of workers in various skilled occupations so as to facilitate industrial development in Asian countries.

Indian Department of Labour recently indicated to us that they were looking to Australia to assist in provision of above facilities.

Please indicate the attitude which you desire to be taken if in the course of discussion in Committee or elsewhere we are questioned in regard to- (a) training in educational institutions, (b) training in industrial establishments.

Resolution appears to involve immigration and industrial as well as political factors.
