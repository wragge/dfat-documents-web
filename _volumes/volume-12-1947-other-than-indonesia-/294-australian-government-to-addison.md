# 294 Australian Government to Addison

Cablegram 25 CANBERRA, 25 January 1947, 11.30 a.m.

SECRET

Reference our 18 to Dominions Office sent Prime Minister of New Zealand 14 and Australian Embassy, Washington 76.

Japanese Peace Settlement Following is a summary of Dr. Evatt's reply to United States Ambassador's communication of 13th December.

Warmly welcomed the United States Government's desire for Australia's full and equal participation and said that we would attach great importance to an assurance of full support of Australia's claim to participation as a party principal in all discussions including preliminary talks.

Recalled conversation between Australian Ambassador in U.S.A. and Secretary of State last December regarding ex-Japanese Mandated Islands.

Said that we have been giving preliminary study to questions involved in the settlement and are ready at any time to enter into exploratory discussions with United States Government. Suggested that there should be an early interchange of views on form of treaty and invited suggestions from United States Government with view to initiating such exchange of views between representatives of the two Governments.

Expressed view that work of drafting and negotiation should be done by those nations who were active belligerents in Japanese war and whose geographical position gives them paramount interests in the Pacific.

Expressed wish that New Zealand be kept fully in touch with any preliminary discussions. Indicated that we were informing United Kingdom Government of purport of this communication.
