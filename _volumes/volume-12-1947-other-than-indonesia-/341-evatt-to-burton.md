# 341 Evatt to Burton

Cablegram unnumbered HMAT KANIMBLA, 20 July 1947, 10.45 a.m.

IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET

Reference United States proposal for Conference.

Makin's apparent failure to explain to Marshall potent objections to the so called expert level of Conference confirms the necessity for written memorandum to be communicated to Marshall. My telegram to you (No- 4, paragraph 2) gave full reasons and United Kingdom telegram quoted by you in your telegram 6 [1] was to the same general effect. As Conference would consider general plan for organisation including voting I could not accept the position that Australia be represented except by Minister. Some other Governments may choose differently but at least each should be free to determine its own representation. Marshall could be told quite frankly that I personally would represent Australia, in view of my intimate and pioneer work on F.E.C. policy and vital importance of settlement to Australia. Marshall might be also reminded of two separate undertakings that Australia would be regarded by the United States of America as a party principal of the settlement. The fact that there are already some differences as to voting indicates the necessity of dealing with such problems at the point where such decisions must be made. Eggleston and Bailey could assist urgently in drafting memorandum.

I assume that general reply as to date has been given in writing by Makin; if not, this should also be drafted.

1 The cablegram quoted was D600 from Addison, dispatched 12 July.

It conveyed the message that the UK Government proposed to send to the US Government. In part it read: 'While it would thus be difficult for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to be represented at a meeting on 19th August, they are in no way opposed in principle to the suggestion for an early meeting to discuss the Japanese peace settlement and would welcome any suggestion the United States Government may be willing to make for a date which would not conflict with the meeting at Canberra...'
