SECRET

Addressed to the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin.

Article VII discussions-employment.

1\. Following from Melville for Minister for External Affairs and Treasurer.

2\. Draft as advised in our 38 [1] was further discussed at third meeting 13th March, and following verbal alterations were made.

[matter omitted]

3\. It was agreed- (i) That the draft International Employment Agreement [2] should, subject to approval of Ministers, be put forward to the United States of America authorities by United Kingdom officials as an essential and central part of the arrangements for implementing article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement and the Atlantic Charter.

(ii) That it would not be wise to represent to United States of America officials that the proposals came from the present meeting but that it could be planned that they had been discussed between United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials.

(iii) That if Australian officials embarked on article VII discussions with United States of America before the Anglo- American conversations were resumed they would raise the matter.
