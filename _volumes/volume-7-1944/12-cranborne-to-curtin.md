# 12 Cranborne to Curtin

Circular cablegram D56 LONDON, 12 January. 1944, 11.40 p.m.

MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister. Begins-

My telegram Circular D.1085, 10th December. [1]

On December 16th, immediately upon his return from Africa, 

President Roosevelt received the Chinese and Turkish Ambassadors 

[2], the Egyptian Minister [3] and the Soviet [4] and Persian [5] 

First Secretaries, in the absence of their chiefs, and His 

Majesty's United Kingdom Minister at Washington [6] (His Majesty's 

United Kingdom Ambassador being indisposed) and made the following 

statement, warning them that they must not repeat to anyone what 

he said.

2\. He had been working very hard to prevent Indo-China from being 

restored to France, which during the last 100 years had done 

nothing for the Indo-Chinese people under their care. The latter 

were still as poor and as uneducated as they had ever been and 

this state of affairs could not be allowed to continue.

3\. He thought that the Indo-Chinese who were not yet ready for 

elective institutions of their own should be placed under some 

United Nations Trusteeship which should take them towards the 

stage when they could govern themselves, somewhat after the manner 

of developments in the Philippines (the President did not make it 

clear whether he was thinking of a United Nations Trusteeship for 

all peoples in this category or whether the administration should 

be in the hands of a single country or of all or several of the 

United Nations).

4\. The President went on to say 'we' would have great trouble over 

this with the French, but that nevertheless it would have to be 

done. At the recent meetings it had been decided that peace must 

be kept by force. There was no other way and world policemen would 

be necessary who would need certain places from which to exercise 

their function without bringing up the question of changes in 

sovereignty. He men tioned Dakar, which in the hands of a country 

too weak to defend it or of a hostile country, constituted an 

immediate threat to the whole of the Western Hemisphere.

5\. The President referred, with pleasure, to the decision taken 

with

Chiang Kai Shek [7] in Cairo that Manchuria, Formosa and 

Pescadores should revert to China. (See my telegram Circular 

D.1046 of 1st December.) [8] Korea, he said, would have to be 

prepared for an elective government under a form of trusteeship, 

while Japan would be com pressed into her own islands and would 

receive various forms of treatment which would prevent her 

becoming a danger again. See my immediately following telegram.
