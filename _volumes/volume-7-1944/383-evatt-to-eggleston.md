# 383 Evatt to Eggleston

Cablegram 2101 [1] CANBERRA, 25 December 944

PERSONAL FOR EGGLESTON FROM EVATT

Your telegram 1250. [2]

It is most important that. the Pacific Council with all its limitations should not disappear and for that reason it is desired that you take steps to this end preferably in conjunction with Berendsen who is of course awaiting instructions from his Government.

The procedure is quite informal. A message to the President's Secretary suggesting meeting to discuss Pacific developments should be sufficient. As Minister you are Australia's representative on the Council and minimum of formality desirable.

The Government has received few reports on the Pacific military position and the President would, I think, appreciate the desirability of discussion. The Council is not an executive body but is advisory and informative and its functions might at any time again become of crucial importance.

The matter needs handling carefully and if there is any hitch I am sure that Hopkins [3] who always sat in with us would again be helpful.
