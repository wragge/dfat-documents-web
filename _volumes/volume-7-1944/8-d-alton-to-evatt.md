# 8 D'Alton to Evatt

Dispatch 44/1/2 (extract) WELLINGTON, 8 January 1944

SECRET

I have the honour to inform you that on 7th January, the day prior 

to my departure for Auckland on my way to Australia, I had a long 

interview with the Prime Minister. Mr. Fraser discussed the 

forthcoming conference to be held in Canberra and made several 

observations which I think are of considerable interest.

2\. Speaking of the future of New Caledonia, Mr. Fraser said that 

he would not like to see the French ousted from this possession. 

Such a step would, he felt, come about only from American pressure 

and would result in complete American occupation. He expressed the 

view that New Zealand would be willing to share responsibility for 

the defence of New Caledonia.

3\. Mr. Fraser also informed me that New Zealand had no wish to 

upset the scope or authority of the British High Commissioner in 

the Western Pacific. He took the view that everything must be done 

to maintain Britain's interest in this area. (I might add that 

there is a certain feeling here that Britain has already lost 

interest in the Pacific and that the omission of any air links 

between America and Australia and New Zealand in the proposals 

decided upon by Lord Beaverbrook's inter-Dominion conference on 

civil aviation [1] is held to be indicative of this trend.)

4\. In speaking of future armistices, Mr. Fraser said definitely 

that, despite his Government's previous attitude to the signing of 

the armistice with Italy, New Zealand wished to play a full part 

in arrangements so far as the Pacific was concerned.
