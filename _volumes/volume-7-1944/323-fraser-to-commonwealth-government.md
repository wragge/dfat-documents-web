# 323 Fraser to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 188 WELLINGTON, 19 October 1944, 2.15 p.m.

SECRET

Your 226 [1]-Surrender instrument for Germany While we are in agreement with the views expressed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of your message we have grave doubts as to the wisdom of the proposals contained in paragraph (3). Whatever might be the immediate advantages of resorting to a concept of British Commonwealth of Nations as an international entity in the long run any such action seems much more calculated to injure the independent International position of the Dominions. [2]

We should, of course, be glad to discuss with your Ministers at the forthcoming Conference whether there is any practical remedy for the very unsatisfactory situation brought about by the inflexible attitude of the Soviet and United States Governments on this particular issue.
