# 46 Glasgow to Evatt

Cablegram 34 OTTAWA, 12 February 1944, 1.30 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

For Evatt from Glasgow.

Your telegram 31. [1] Mutual Aid General Agreement.

Canadians have now agreed to amend article 10 by substituting for the words 'the expansion of International commerce by the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers' the words 'the expansion of commerce through appropriate international agreements on commercial policy'. The agreements, including the article in this amended form, were signed in Ottawa yesterday with the United Kingdom and Soviet Governments. I understand that Davis has been instructed to inform you of the above, and also of two minor amendments to articles 9(c) and II. [2]

I feel that elimination of reference to tariffs and trade barriers is most satisfactory from our point of view and would strongly recommend that we now meet [Canadian] [3] desire for early signature of agreement. [4]
