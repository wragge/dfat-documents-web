# 90 MacArthur to Curtin

## Letter GENERAL HEADQUARTERS SOUTHWEST PACIFIC AREA,

22 March 1944

SECRET

The operational implications of Mr. Churchill's proposal contained in your letter of March 16th [1] have been carefully considered. I feel that existing agencies, the Southwest Pacific Area or the Australian Chiefs of Staff, can furnish any data that may be desired by the British Chiefs of Staff and that therefore the proposed visit of parties of administrative experts seems a waste of time and energy. Pending detailed studies with regard to any specific proposal, I feel that it may be stated that ample base facilities can be provided for any force that might be sent to this area. I suggest that if you deem it feasible in this connection, it might be stated that the existing organisation in the Southwest Pacific Area is capable of employing any forces that may be supplied and that such forces, if made available, should fit into the existing structure and should not contemplate the organisation of separate and distinct elements.
