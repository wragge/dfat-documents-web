# 10 Commonwealth Government to Cranborne

Cablegram 12 CANBERRA, 11 January 1944

MOST SECRET

The Australian Government has been following closely your recent 

telegrams on the situation in Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy and 

much appreciates detailed advice of developments.

2\. In general we fear that unless great care is taken Allies may 

lay themselves open to the charge of endeavouring to return to the 

pre war status quo in these countries and bolstering up old 

regimes to which the majority of the populations concerned are 

violently opposed.

3\. YUGOSLAVIA

We fully realise the desirability of preserving the State of 

Yugoslavia as an independent entity although all the trends are in 

the direction of a loose-knit confederation consisting of at least 

three and possibly five or six units.

At the same time we are extremely doubtful whether continued 

British backing of the King of Yugoslavia [1] will help towards 

Yugoslav unity. In this connection we note in particular the views 

expressed by the Head of the British Military Mission to the 

Partisan Movement [2], and the British Ambassador to the Yugoslav 

Government [3] (D.O. tele gram 1182 of 27th December [4]) that 

'the dynasty would not be a unifying factor in Yugoslavia and its 

return would be bitterly opposed by the majority of the nation', 

that 'the King has been personally discredited in the eyes of the 

Partisans', and that 'he is irreparably compromised with the 

Partisans and a sudden volte face on his part at this stage would 

not affect their attitude'.

With regard to General Mihailovitch [5] we have noted particularly 

your telegram (D.1062 of 6th December [6]) giving your analysis of 

his position stating that he 'is not only of no military value to 

the Allies but has also become a standing obstacle to any sort of 

Yugoslav unity either now or in the near future'; and also Mr. 

Churchill's statement to the King of Yugoslavia on 10th December 

that 'we had irrefutable evidence that General Mihailovitch was 

collaborating with the enemy'.

In the light of these views it seems to us that the time has come 

to withdraw support finally from Mihailovitch and to consider very 

serious ly whether it should not also be withdrawn from the King 

and Government, henceforward concentrating support on Tito [7] and 

his National Committee and allowing the question regarding the 

monarchy to stand over for decision by the Yugoslav people after 

the war. in particular we feel that it would be ineffective and 

imprudent to send the King to Tito's headquarters.

4\. GREECE

With regard to Greece we welcome the steps that are being taken to 

promote unity in Greek resistance but feel that here again as in 

the case of Yugoslavia too much stress has been laid on the 

position of the King. [8]

5\. ITALY

With regard to Italy we are disturbed by the views recently ex 

pressed by the British Minister to the Vatican [9] reported in 

D.O.

Telegram D.3 of 1st January. [10] Bearing in mind our basic war 

aims we feel that it is now desirable to strengthen the hands of 

the democratic groups in Italy, with a view to formation of a 

widely based and representative Government as early as possible.

national stability and that parliamentary democracy was unlikely 

to appeal to Italians for an appreciable time'.
