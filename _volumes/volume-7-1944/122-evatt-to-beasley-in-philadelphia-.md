# 122 Evatt to Beasley (in Philadelphia)

Cablegram 583 [1] CANBERRA, 29 April 1944

PERSONAL TO BEASLEY ALONE FROM EVATT SECRET

I.L.O. Conference.

1\. The reaction to your work has been quite satisfactory. There has been a sneer from Menzies [2], a yelp from Spender [3] and a growl from Harrison [4], but on the whole you have helped to make it very clear that we mean business on full employment.

2\. The suggested United States formula is in my opinion quite futile. [5] We might as well ask the I.L.O. to recommend governments to observe the Ten Commandments. The recommendations are so abstract in general that the point of full employment is utterly lost. I am coming to the conclusion that those controlling governments are fearful of the implications of full employment. It makes it more necessary than ever that your fight should be continued.

3\. I have struggled hard for recognition of the full employment doctrine, and often under adverse circumstances. I am sure you will make this clear at the conference and press interviews. It has not been made clear either from your speeches or interviews as reported here. This is important because in relation to New Zealand, the United Kingdom and South Africa I have given an interpretation of Article 7 which has been endorsed by Full Cabinet [6] and which makes full employment and consumption the primary and supreme objective.

4\. Frankly, if the I.L.O. cannot improve the United States draft the sooner other machinery is found to further our objectives, the better.

5\. I am sending you a further telegram [7] which should be of assistance.
