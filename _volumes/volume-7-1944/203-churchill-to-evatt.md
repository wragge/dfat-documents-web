# 203 Churchill to Evatt

Cablegram 145 [1] LONDON, 22 June 1944, 4 p.m.

PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET

Following from the Prime Minister to Dr. Evatt.

1\. Delighted to have your message of 14th June. [2] You may be sure we shall never overlook the fact that a strong France is a vital element in the future security of Europe in which you are so definitely interested. We are still toiling to get an agreement with de Gaulle on the outstanding points. Though I am quite sure he is no friend of Britain, I am still persevering to bring about a good arrangement all round.

2\. Kindest regards from Brendan [3] and me to you and W. S. [4] I had hoped to meet him when he was in this country but so much was going on and he was gone before I could contact him. I hope you will pay us another visit before long.
