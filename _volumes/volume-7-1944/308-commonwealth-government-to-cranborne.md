# 308 Commonwealth Government to Cranborne

Cablegram 257 [1] CANBERRA, 3 October 1944

SECRET

Your D.1404. [2]

1\. We have replied to American Minister accepting invitation to international air conference in United States on November 1st. [3] In doing so we stated that it was assumed that the agenda would not necessarily be limited to the list of objectives set out in the American Note and that in our view the agenda should be broad enough to allow scope for an exchange of views regarding the future of international civil aviation after the provisional period has elapsed. We stated that in many respects the questions in Item 3 (a) [4] of the United States list of objectives appeared to us to be among the most important matters to be considered at an international air conference at this stage.

2\. We agree with the suggestion that British Commonwealth talks be held in Canada on October 23 and have informed Canada of our acceptance of invitation to these talks. [5]
