# 3 Roosevelt to Curtin Letter

Letter WASHINGTON, 3 January 1944

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Now that I am back from the Conferences [1] with Mr. Churchill and 

the Generalissimo and Marshal Stalin, I feel even more strongly 

that you and I should meet. As you know, I have been close to 

Mackenzie King almost since we were boys; Marshal Smuts and I 

first met in 1918, and I had a grand reunion with him in Cairo 

last month; and Peter Fraser has stopped off here in Washington 

several times; and I feel that there is a real void which can only 

be filled by a meeting between you and me.

I do hope that you will consider coming here within a few months. 

It would not take you long and my thought is that you would spend 

a couple of days at the White House, making perhaps one public 

appearance either on the West Coast or in New York City at a big 

meeting. Then you could run up for a day or two to see Mackenzie 

King.

Incidentally and confidentially, while Churchill and I did not 

discuss the matter in any way, I do not think it would do anything 

but good if you could go to London for a short visit. I think you 

would receive a very warm welcome.

My plans call for no definite absence from Washington for some 

months though, of course, the military situation may change 

suddenly making it necessary for me to dash off to a meeting 

before that.

There are many things I want to talk with you about, even though 

they are not matters which require immediate decisions. For 

instance, I think we should discuss the future military, naval and 

air protection of Australia and, in a preliminary way at least, 

the disposition of the Japanese-owned mandated or controlled 

islands. Also, I want to talk with you about the future policing 

of the whole Pacific and Asiatic area.

In this country, we are all very keen about the splendid work that 

is being done by Australia. As the head of a Government, you 

realize as I do that when there are 'no complaints' and 'no 

criticisms', it means that things are going well! As we used to 

say in my rowing days, Australia is 'pulling its weight in the 

boat'.

With my warm regards and all good wishes for the New Year.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

1 Churchill, Roosevelt and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese 

President and, until 4 December, President of the Executive Yuan)

then proceeded to Tehran for discussions with Stalin between 28 

November and 1 December. From 4 to 6 December, Churchill and 

Roosevelt again met in Cairo where they conferred with Turkey's 

President Inonu.
