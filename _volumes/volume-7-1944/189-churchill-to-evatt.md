# 189 Churchill to Evatt

Cablegram 131 LONDON, 8 June 1944, 10.05 p.m.

MOST SECRET FOLLOWING PERSONAL FOR DR EVATT

Your 128. [1]

1\. There is no intention here or at Washington of recognizing the French National Committee as the Provisional Government of France, nor of building up de Gaulle [2] as the Master of France. We are engaged in the greatest operation yet attempted and the battle will be continuous in France as in Italy for a good many weeks to come. No French troops will be involved in the Atlantic operation for some months. I took particular pains to bring General de Gaulle here before we actually took the leap in order that due respect should be paid to France. We could not trust him or his Committee with the secret before the moment came. He has made himself extremely disagreeable here, making many difficulties and complaints which we patiently endure.

2\. We are doing our best to promote good relations between the French National Committee, including de Gaulle, and Washington. As far as I am concerned I will never consent to quarrel with the President of the United States on account of the antics of General de Gaulle.
