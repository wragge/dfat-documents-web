Please convey immediately following to Prime Minister of New Zealand- Begins- 1. We greatly regret the delay in finalising plans for talks with you and your Ministers. Our own plans have been affected by proposed absence of Prime Minister in Western Australia during fortnight of the present month and the absence of other Ministers, during present month, from Canberra.

(b) On the 28th of the month, Mr. Forde, Deputy Prime Minister and Dr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, with staff will leave Sydney by air for general talks in fulfilment of the Australian New Zealand Agreement. [1]

We hope that these proposals will be satisfactory.
