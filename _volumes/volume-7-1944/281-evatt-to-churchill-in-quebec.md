Cablegram 270 [1] CANBERRA, 15 September 1944

MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET AND PERSONAL

Following for Mr. Churchill from Dr. Evatt.

Begins.

We are very pleased at your inviting Glasgow to Quebec. [2] As you know appearances are very important in such matters and there has been some press criticism in this country of the fact that Australia is not formally represented at the Conference. In the circumstances your sending for Australian and New Zealand representatives is very wise and statesmanlike and Glasgow informs me that you will be reporting results to Curtin in due course.

Kindest personal regards.

Ends.
