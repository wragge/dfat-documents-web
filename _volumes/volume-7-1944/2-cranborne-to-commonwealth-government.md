# 2 Cranborne to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram D1 LONDON, 2 January 1944, 3.55 p.m.

MOST SECRET

My telegram of 31st December, D.1214. [1]

Following estimation as at end of November has been received from 

His Majesty's United Kingdom Ambassador, Washington of the 

official United States attitude towards post-war civil air 

transport. Begins:-

1\. The following estimation of the official American attitude to 

wards post-war civil air transport is necessarily a statement of 

opinion. It represents the position as we see it at the moment but 

American views are still fluid.

2\. It would seem that American aims in the field of post-war civil 

air transport may be:

(a) The establishment of at least one American round the world air 

service plus commercial air entry into all major nations. A route 

across Russia might perhaps be regarded as a better proposition 

than one alongside a British route via India.

(b) The right to operate air services in the Middle East and 

Africa with at least partial cabotage.

(c) Unrestricted civil air transit rights (implying rights of 

innocent passage and of landing for non-traffic purposes) with 

some additional rights in Canada (to Alaska), Newfoundland, 

Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, Bermuda, West Indies, Guiana and the 

Irish Free State to be obtained in exchange for transit rights in 

America, the Pacific Islands and Alaska while keeping South 

America and the Pacific as much as possible for the Americans.

(d) A permanent agreement embodying the above rights.

3\. It is probable that Americans would dislike agreements between 

any two or more countries which discriminate against third parties 

except perhaps present enemies. They fear that in the absence of 

international agreement the United Kingdom and the dominions may 

be driven back on to an 'all red' policy which would hamper 

American air line development abroad.

4\. Internal political considerations are likely to make it 

essential for the Americans to obtain a form of agreement which 

will satisfy public opinion that reasonable use of airfields 

constructed by them overseas has been secured. Some sort of 

international control might be regarded as a satisfactory 

solution.

5\. Although at first sight these aims may appear formidable the 

Americans recognise that there are also legitimate British aims 

which must be met, for example transit rights across America, the 

Pacific Islands and Alaska.

6\. There seems no reason to suppose that the Americans would 

reject the first two of the 'Four Freedoms' adopted by the 

Commonwealth Conference in London [2], viz. the right of innocent 

passage and the right to land for non-traffic purposes, since 

these are essential to accomplish American aims. It is thought 

that the last two, viz. the right to land passengers from the 

country of origin and the right to pick up passengers for the 

country of origin, might be acceptable subject to agreement on 

regulation and provisions for special variations or arrangements 

affecting contiguous countries, for example Canada and America. It 

is observed that freight and mails are not specifically referred 

to in the last two freedoms but the Americans would probably 

consider that they would have to be included in the scope of any 

satisfactory international agreement.

7\. The Americans might agree that carriage of passengers by 

country A between countries B and C should be subject to 

negotiations between countries concerned.

8\. As regards the right to carry between two points in one 

country, not the country of origin, the Americans would be 

unwilling to concede cabotage within United States and are 

unlikely to grant it between United States territories. On the 

other hand, despite what Mr. Berle has said, they might try to 

obtain it for themselves elsewhere; for example within and between 

British territories in Africa. They will be reluctant to recognise 

the British Commonwealth as a unit for this purpose because they 

realize their lack of bargaining powers in the cabotage field. 

They may therefore try to avoid discussing it until other 

controversial points have been settled.

9\. The Americans recognise the need for an international technical 

authority to replace the International Commission on air 

navigation. They might also suggest placing finance and operation 

of airfields in hazardous or undeveloped territories such as 

Greenland, Iceland and Liberia on an international basis.

10\. As regards an operating executive the Americans would probably 

agree but it is probable that the State Department and Civil 

Aeronautics Department would want to exercise close control of 

American representatives. It is not possible to say what form of 

executive they would favour pending clarification of their own 

policy as regards a 'chosen instrument' although it seems likely 

they will retain a free commercial basis. On the relationship of 

this international authority to any United Nations security 

organization which may be established no opinion can be given.

11\. The proposal for international zones of operation is unlikely 

to appeal to the Americans. They might agree as regards Europe but 

the problem of international operation in the Middle and Far East 

seems likely to raise difficult issues. American views on this can 

only be elicited by direct discussion. Counter proposals to make 

Latin America exclusively [an] [3] American field might be put 

forward.

12\. The above seems to show that the argument will be tough but 

that in spite of divergencies a basis for agreement upon 

principles might be found.
