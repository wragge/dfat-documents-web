# 5 D'Alton to Evatt

Dispatch 44/1/1 (extracts) WELLINGTON, 5 January 1944

SECRET

1\. Since my arrival in Wellington [1] I have endeavoured to gain 

some idea of the lines on which New Zealand Ministers and 

officials were thinking with regard to the problems which are due 

to come up for discussion between Australia and New Zealand this 

month. I have had lengthy and friendly discussions with most 

members of the Government and heads of departments and I have 

touched on as many as possible of the subjects listed on the draft 

agenda. [2]

2\. From these preliminary discussions, what has impressed me 

generally has been the scarcity of thought which has as yet been 

given here to many of the major topics on which it is hoped to 

reach agreement. I have consequently emphasised that the 

Commonwealth Government is preparing carefully for the conference 

and that the New Zealand delegation should be in a position to 

express their views fully on all questions likely to be raised.

3\. For example, international civil aviation is a subject which 

has apparently not been deeply thought out here. The Minister of 

Defence, Mr. Jones, is also Minister of Air, but he does not 

regard post-war civil aviation as coming within his sphere. The 

Director General of Civil Aviation [3] is at present stationed in 

Melbourne as a liaison officer and it is doubtful whether the 

Secretary, Department of Air [4], whose views I reported in my 

despatch No. 5 of 23rd December, 1943 [5], may be regarded as 

fully reflecting the ideas of the Government. Previous decisions 

regarding Pacific air routes and landing rights were handled 

personally by Mr. Nash, and in his absence the whole subject is 

held to be a question of policy devolving on the Prime Minister 

alone. How far the views attributed to Mr. Nash in Australia 

regarding the establishment of an international aviation concern 

in the Pacific are shared by Mr. Fraser I cannot say, but I should 

judge that the whole problem has not yet received very full 

consideration here.

4\. There is no New Zealand Minister responsible for post-war 

reconstruction in the sense in which the term is used in 

Australia. Major Skinner is Minister of Rehabilitation but his 

duties extend only to the repatriation of returned soldiers and 

the scope of duties of the newly appointed Director of 

Rehabilitation, Colonel Baker, does not compare with that of the 

Australian Department of Post-War Reconstruction. A number of 

'Local Rehabilitation Committees' have been established in towns 

and cities throughout New Zealand and there are some inter-

Ministerial committees on various aspects of reconstruction, but 

from what I have gathered their work has not reached the standard 

of that done by our Australian committees. As emerged from a 

conversation with Mr. Skinner, it appears that where there is a 

divergence of opinion between different Ministers, the Prime 

Minister is expected to intervene and define the Government's 

policy.

5\. Migration is a topic to which very little thought has been 

given by the New Zealand Government. Although there is a Minister 

of Migration, there is no Department, committee or official whose 

task it has been to advise on migration policy although I assume 

that this question has been raised by the United Kingdom 

Government with New Zealand as with Australia. The only opinions 

which I have heard expressed here are firstly, that New Zealand, 

until there are houses enough for the present population, cannot 

receive further inhabitants and secondly, that New Zealand, being 

essentially an agricultural community, will never have a large 

population. There seems to be little recognition of the 

possibility that the pressure of a world opinion upon countries 

which may be regarded as under-populated may force migration to be 

considered at the forthcoming peace settlements. The only 

documentation on this topic likely to be presented at the 

conference will probably be prepared in the Department of External 

Affairs, and policy is likely to be decided by the Prime Minister 

when the question arises.

6\. On the question of the future organisation of the Pacific it is 

difficult to give a very clear indication of New Zealand's views. 

Mr. Nash has already spoken on this matter in Australia, when he 

amplified the remarks which, as reported in despatch No. 1 of 13th 

December, 1943 [6], he made to me on the day of my arrival in 

Wellington. As you have probably seen from press reports, Mr. 

Fraser immediately issued a statement making it clear that Mr. 

Nash's views were expressed person ally and had not been approved 

by the New Zealand Government. From the full copy of Mr. Fraser's 

statement, which I attach, you will note the Prime Minister's 

opinion that 'federation in the sense of union or transfer of 

sovereignty on the part of the Pacific Powers was not in the mind 

of the New Zealand Government'. Mr. Fraser endorsed however the 

principle of trusteeship which he said had formed the basis of New 

Zealand's policy in relation to the Pacific peoples under their 

control for many years.

7\. On broad questions of policy such as international security, 

regional advisory commissions for certain areas, disarmament and 

the establishment of world order, I should judge from contacts 

with officials that the New Zealand Government may be expected to 

continue to hold views very similar to those expressed at the 

League of Nations in 1936 and after when the New Zealand 

representative was an advocate of collective security, and the 

strengthening of the League structure. Mr. Fraser has expressed to 

me his concurrence with the views contained in Mr. Curtin's recent 

address to the Triennial Conference of the Australian Labor Party. 

[7]

8\. Should economic questions be discussed such as the application 

of Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, it must be remembered 

that the major factor in New Zealand's policy is the dependence of 

this country's economy on the British market for dairy products, 

meat and wool. This is a theme to which New Zealanders tend to 

revert whether in speaking of the possible expansion of industry 

in New Zealand, the growth of trade with Australia, post-war 

reconstruction or international commercial policy generally. They 

regard Australia's economy as being more varied and resilient and 

are, I feel, inclined to underestimate the degree of dependence of 

Australia also on markets for a few primary products. Although 

commercial policy is not listed on the draft agenda for the 

conference, I think that Mr. Fraser would be willing to discuss it 

and, as I have said before, it is a topic which in the minds of 

New Zealanders, is fundamentally important to their future 

development.

9\. It is possible that the question of supply and especially of 

food production will be discussed and I think it desirable that it 

should. Since my arrival here I have spoken continually of the 

efforts Australia has made in this field, of our vastly increased 

production, of our strict rationing, and of the goods which are 

not rationed but which are unobtainable in our country. Privately 

I have drawn the contrast with New Zealand which is still a land 

of plenty and where, to the civilian, the war is a long way away 

and tending to recede further daily. Even the official attitude 

here is somewhat complacent and, whereas in Australia every effort 

is made to shoulder extra commitments, here the marketing 

authorities tend to adopt the attitude that plans which have been 

made for a year ahead cannot be altered.

10\. From what I can gather it is to be assumed that no general 

increase in food production is expected this season. The season 

has not been good and the farmers have faced similar difficulties 

to Australia in obtaining fertilisers and machinery. On the other 

hand there is a fairly widespread feeling that in the spheres both 

of tighter rationing and increased production New Zealand could do 

more, as the attached press cuttings show. What is needed is a 

strong lead, and I believe that if the Government gave it the 

people would respond as they have done in Australia. Every effort 

should be made to bring home to the New Zealand delegation the 

extent of Australia's contribution to the Allied food requirements 

and every encouragement given them to take firmer steps here to 

increase the amount available from this country. The complacency 

of New Zealanders in this field, due as it is to their isolation, 

could be shaken by bringing forcibly to their notice the efforts 

of their sister Dominion.

[matter omitted]

14\. In the discussions, the predominant position of the New 

Zealand Prime Minister should be kept in mind. Mr. Fraser and Mr. 

Nash are the outstanding leaders of the New Zealand Government, 

but while Mr. Nash is more productive of ideas, Mr. Fraser is the 

man to make decisions. For that reason I think that although as 

mentioned earlier in this despatch, the New Zealand delegation may 

come to the talks with no very detailed statements of policy, 

concrete results may be expected.

Of all major questions of policy in New Zealand today Mr. Fraser 

appears to be the main arbiter. The two Ministers [8] accompanying 

him to the talks may be expected to play parts of very minor 

importance.

The decisions will be made by Mr. Fraser, and once made he will be 

in a strong position to gain their acceptance by his Government 

and party.
