# 261 Evatt to Bruce

Cablegram 165 [1] CANBERRA, 26 August 1944

PERSONAL FOR BRUCE FROM EVATT

The Soviet Government has at times caused some real embarrassment, but I would like you to examine recent cables relating to (a) alleged failure of Soviet Government to give active assistance in Allied efforts to aid the Partisans in Warsaw and (b) Soviet activity in Greek affairs.

What strikes me is that it is unwise to give too much emphasis to what are after all relatively minor matters in a military situation which is developing most dramatically and favourably.

If you agree with this point of view, you might convey it to Eden.
