STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH PORTUGAL

The Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces, said that Staff conversations, at which Australia was represented by Brigadier A. W. Wardell, were at present being held in Lisbon, for discussion of Portuguese participation in any Allied operation for the occupation of Timor.

2\. It was expected that the results of the conversations would be known in a few weeks' time. [1]

3\. Mr. McEwen [2] suggested that, in view of the importance of Portuguese Timor in relation to the security of Australia in the postwar period, consideration should be given to the adoption of economic measures to ensure the predominance of Australian influence there as soon as Portuguese Timor was liberated.
