# 369 Hodgson to Evatt

Cablegram 1197 [1] [CHICAGO], 7 December [2] 1944, 7.55 p.m.

IMMEDIATE PERSONAL TO THE MINISTER FROM HODGSON

The last two official cables [3] give the latest picture.

Personally I think we should not sign the Two Freedom Document until it can be given further consideration.

Rumours here to-day that Berle has resigned. [4] Undoubtedly he has caused offence by his manner and some of his statements and most of his own delegation feel that the United States made a mistake in not agreeing to an international authority with powers to control and regulate.

The conference has been very strenuous for me as I am on three Drafting Committees including the main coordinating one which will be working till the last. Wednesday should see the end and I propose to go to Washington on Thursday. I would appreciate if you would send to me there any views or instructions you have.
