# 176 Bruce to Curtin (in Washington)

Cablegram 9 [1] LONDON, 31 May 1944

FOR PRIME MINISTER PERSONAL HIMSELF

Discussions with the Americans in regard to post-war Civil Aviation. Evatt's telegram to you of 27th May No. 72 London (repeated to Washington No. 789) [2] has not altered my view in respect to the advice I ventured to tender to you that it is desirable in view of the conversations that have already taken place and are contemplated with other countries that we should accept the American invitation for preliminary discussions [3] and that they should be conducted by the Minister for Air with McVey as his adviser. All the arguments advanced by Evatt could be employed by Drakeford in an attempt to influence and modify the American attitude and bring it more into line with Australia's views.

In my opinion the discussions would not be limited by the suggested agenda which Winant sent you or by Berle's communication to Dixon. [4] if any doubt exists on this point it could be removed by making clear in the acceptance of the invitation that we contemplated that the discussions should cover every aspect of the question.
