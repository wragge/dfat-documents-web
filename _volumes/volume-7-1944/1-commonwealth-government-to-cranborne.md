# 1 Commonwealth Government to Cranborne

Cablegram 2 CANBERRA, 2 January 1944

SECRET

Your D.1190 and your No. 398. [1]

1\. The Australian Government regards it as essential that there 

should be a frank understanding of the arrangement made in London 

in July between Mr. Churchill, Mr. Eden, Mr. Attlee and Dr. Evatt 

in relation to the protection of Australian postwar interests in 

Timor including Defence, Trade and Communications. [2] We cannot 

forget that no assistance whatever was received by us from 

Portugal at the crucial time and even if Portugal now proposes to 

engage in active combat With Japan the arrangement made is 

necessary to protect our interests.

2\. in the circumstances we regret that your proposed communication 

to the United States Government was not submitted to us in the 

first instance. For instance the phrase 'The Liberation of Timor' 

might suggest to the United States an absolute restoration of 

Portuguese sovereignty without any of the necessary qualifications 

or addenda. Presumably Australia's special interests, having 

already been made clear to the Portuguese, will be made equally 

clear to the United States Government.

3\. With regard to Staff conversations we are quite prepared to 

take part in these.

1 Dispatched 29 and 28 December respectively. On file AA:A989, 

E43-44/970/54. These cablegrams advised of U.K. proposals to the 

United States concerning the 'considerable advantages' of 

Portugal's entry into the war against Japan, and urged staff talks 

in London by U.K., U.S., Portuguese and Australian officers to 

'draw up a plan of Portuguese co operation in the war against 

Japan'.
