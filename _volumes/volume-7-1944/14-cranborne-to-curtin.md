# 14 Cranborne to Curtin

Cablegram D58 LONDON, 13 January 1944, 1 a.m.

MOST SECRET

Following for the Prime Minister.

My immediately preceding telegram. [1]

We feel that in view of the nature and size of his audience, 

President Roosevelt's remarks will probably reach a wider circle, 

possibly in distorted form and may have repercussions. We, 

therefore, thought it advisable to instruct His Majesty's United 

Kingdom Ambassador to sound a note of caution in Washington. Lord 

Halifax accordingly asked Mr. Hull very confidentially whether the 

President's remarks represented a concerted White House - State 

Department policy, whether the President had considered his 

proposals in relation to American pledges and whether the State 

Department had considered the question of French Pacific 

possessions in the light of a possible post war security system in 

that area.

Mr. Hull replied that he had no more knowledge of the matter than 

Lord Halifax. It is plain, therefore, that the President's remarks 

did not represent any settled policy in which the State Department 

was concerned. Mr. Hull said that he did, from time to time, 

remind the President of the pledges given in relation to France 

and added that he supposed that the President and Mr. Churchill 

would be talking about the matter more closely at a later date.
