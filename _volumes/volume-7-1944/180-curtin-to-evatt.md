# 180 Curtin to Evatt

Cablegram PM48 (extract) WASHINGTON, 3 June 1944

MOST SECRET

For Evatt Your 789. [1]

Australia has neither aircraft nor organisation which enable it to act independently. It is therefore my view that it would be unwise to decline United States invitation [2] to hold exploratory talks on postwar international aviation. I propose to raise matter on my return with the object of sending Minister for Civil Aviation and adviser to have preliminary discussions with American authorities.

Australian viewpoint could then be clearly set out and possibly Americans induced to modify attitude.
