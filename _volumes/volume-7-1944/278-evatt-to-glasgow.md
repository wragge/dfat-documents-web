# 278 Evatt to Glasgow

## Cablegram 267 CANBERRA, 14 September 1944

Following for Glasgow from Evatt.

If you have not already done so, please leave for Quebec [1] immediately. Keep close contact with Churchill and keep me fully informed to the best of your ability. Of course the Prime Minister receives messages from Mr. Churchill but your appearance on the scene of the Conference would be timely. Act in close co-operation always with Churchill. [2]

1 Churchill and Roosevelt and their respective Chiefs of Staff met at the Second Quebec Conference (code named 'Octagon') from 12 to 16 September.

2 On 12 September Glasgow had dispatched a cablegram advising that Churchill had asked to see him in Quebec and that accordingly Glasgow would arrive there on 13 September. See Glasgow's cablegram 297 on file AA:A989, 44/970/72.
