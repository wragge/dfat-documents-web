# 130 Winant to Curtin (in London)

## Letter LONDON, 4 May 1944

I have been asked by the Department of State to inquire whether you would be disposed to hold exploratory talks on post-war international aviation when you pass through Washington on your way home. If this be the case, the Department would be delighted to take this opportunity for such talks and would like to know when you would arrive and who would participate for your Government. I enclose a copy of the agenda which my Government has prepared for its talks with the Canadians and with the British. I have been asked to make a similar request of the Prime Minister of New Zealand.

JOHN S. WINANT
