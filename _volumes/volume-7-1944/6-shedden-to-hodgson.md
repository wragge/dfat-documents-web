# 6 Shedden to Hodgson

Memorandum [CANBERRA], 7 January 1944

MOST SECRET

FUTURE OF SOUTHWEST PACIFIC REGION-CONFERENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN 

AND NEW ZEALAND MINISTERS, JANUARY 1944 

With further reference to my letter of 20th December [1] I am 

forwarding herewith a copy of a report by the Defence Committee on 

the subjects on which information has been sought by you.

2\. In view of the urgency with which this information is required 

and owing to the absence of the Minister for Defence in Western 

Australia, it has not been possible to submit the report to him. 

As I have already discussed the subjects with the Minister I am 

aware that the report meets with his general approval, subject to 

the following special observations on certain passages:-

Fundamental Assumptions 

Paragraph 5(a). In regard to the assumption in paragraph 5(a) of 

the Defence Committee's report that total reliance should not be 

placed on any system of collective security, it is observed that 

the establishment of an effective regional collective system in 

the Pacific is considered by the Minister to be of vital 

importance to Australia. He made this clear in his speech of 14th 

December, 1943. [2] 

As stated in paragraph 6 of the Defence Committee's report, it is 

impracticable for Australia and New Zealand to defend the 

Southwest Pacific Area unaided and this has been the experience of 

the present war. Australia is in a sphere of American strategic 

responsibility and its security has been largely dependent on 

American seapower and assistance from United States Land and Air 

Forces and supplies which could not have reached this theatre but 

for the exercise of such command of the sea.

Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be 

controlled by a friendly Power

Paragraph 21. The Minister considers that the establishment of a 

base in the Solomon Islands - New Hebrides Area as a joint United 

Kingdom - Australian - New Zealand commitment is a matter for 

later consideration in the light of subsequent discussions with 

the New Zealand and United Kingdom Governments. This principle 

also has a bearing on the reciprocal aspect of Australian 

participation in the garrisoning of bases such as Singapore which 

might later be raised by the United Kingdom Government.

The extent to which Australia will be able to maintain or to 

contribute to the maintenance of the base in the Solomon Islands 

New Hebrides Area depends upon the future strength of the 

Australian Forces. This is related to the effectiveness of the 

collective system that may be established and a review of the 

principles of Defence which emerge as the result of the experience 

of this war. The former cannot yet be determined and the Defence 

Committee has an instruction to report upon the latter as soon as 

it feels that it is in a position to do so. 

Also related to the question of garrisoning bases outside 

Australian territory in the post-war period are the limitations 

imposed by the Defence Act. 

There is also the definitive extent of the responsibility of the 

Commonwealth Government for the Local Defence of Australia. In the 

light of the experience of this war and the views outlined by the 

Defence Committee, the security of Australia can most effectively 

be ensured by a defence system founded on an outer screen of bases 

in the adjacent islands. The question of the scope of Australian 

Local Defence is also linked with the further development of co-

operation in Empire Defence. 

3\. In connection with your further letter of 31st December [3], 

the aspects relating to defence policy are covered by the report 

of the Defence Committee. It is added that the Defence Committee 

considers that the subject matter of its report should not be 

included in the confidential Handbook. 

4\. Enquiries have been made of this Department by Service 

Departments as to the scope of the advice which your Department 

desires from them in pursuance of a similar request made to them. 

As the Minister for Defence is responsible for Defence Policy and 

as matters relating to the activities of the Services included in 

the draft agenda may have implications from the aspect of Defence 

Policy, it has been arranged that Service Departments will 

transmit any information that they may wish to furnish through 

this Department. The attendance of any representative of a Service 

Department will be at the discretion of the Service Minister 

concerned for advice to him on Service aspects not involving 

questions of Defence Policy.

Enclosure 

FUTURE OF SOUTHWEST PACIFIC REGION-CONFERENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN 

AND NEW ZEALAND MINISTERS, JANUARY 1944 [4] 

TERMS OF REFERENCE 

The Defence Committee noted the wish of the Minister for De fence 

that the Defence Committee should consider what could be done 

towards meeting the request of the Department of External Affairs 

for information on the following subjects for use in connexion 

with the forthcoming conference between Australian and New Zealand 

Ministers on the future of the Southwest Pacific Area:- 

(1) Bases in the Southwest Pacific Area which must be controlled 

by Australia; 

(2) Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be 

controlled by a friendly power; 

(3) Extent to which Australia could maintain bases mentioned under 

(1), including consideration of cost, manpower, industrial 

potential, etc.; 

(4) Mutual defence problems and interests of Australia and New 

Zealand; 

(5) Desirable forms of mutual assistance as contribution by 

Australia and New Zealand towards maintenance of peace and 

security (e.g. munitions, aircraft, staff co-operation, supply); 

(6) Defence problems connected with civil air transport in South 

west and South Pacific Areas; 

(7) General view of a desirable international security system in 

the Western Pacific. 

2\. The Defence Committee was informed that the Department of 

External Affairs had on enquiry advised that for the purposes of 

the foregoing Terms of Reference it was intended:- 

(a) that the phrase 'friendly power' in paragraph 2 should be 

taken to include the United Kingdom and New Zealand; and 

(b) that the phrase 'Western Pacific' in paragraph 7 should be 

taken to include the Far East. 

The Defence Committee also proceeded on the basis that Australia 

should be taken to include Australian Territories and the 

Australian Mandated Territories. 

3\. With reference to the use of phrase 'friendly power' to cover 

the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the Defence Committee re 

corded its view that it was inappropriate to refer to other 

members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as 'friendly 

powers' and that such usage would be likely to cause confusion 

particularly in connexion with matters of Imperial defence. 

4\. It was noted that in requesting the Defence Committee to 

provide information upon the foregoing matters, the Minister for 

De fence has stated that he realized that some of the questions 

are dependent upon the effectiveness of any system of collective 

security that may be established and on the strength of the forces 

to be maintained after the war, and on both of these questions 

some guidance from the Government is really necessary in the first 

place. The task of preparing this report in connexion with 

problems affecting the Pacific Area has demonstrated to the 

Defence Committee the force of these observations and it has been 

felt that, in the absence of that guidance from the Government and 

in the present state of uncertainty, the most that can be done is 

to make certain fundamental assumptions and deal with the 

questions broadly upon such a basis. 

FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS 

5\. The Defence Committee considered that, for the purposes of this 

report, it was reasonable to assume:- 

(a) that total reliance should not be placed on any system of 

collective security; 

(b) that no country should accept the risk of relying primarily 

for its defence upon the assistance of a foreign power; 

(c) that the attack upon the Southwest Pacific Region against 

which precautions should be taken is that of some first-class 

Asiatic Power; 

(d) that the present Japanese Mandated Territories will, after the 

war, be under the control of a friendly power. 

6\. The Defence Committee also concluded that, because the security 

of sea communications is vital to the defence of the Southwest 

Pacific Region and this can only be secured by powerful naval and 

air forces, it is impracticable for Australia and New Zealand to 

defend the Area unaided and the best assurance of its security 

would be a scheme of Imperial defence formulated and carried out 

by the members of the British Commonwealth in co-operation. This, 

however, would not be to the exclusion of a wider system of 

collective security. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

7\. Before considering the particular subjects referred to it, the 

Defence Committee have thought it necessary to state what they 

consider are Australia's primary defence requirements, keeping in 

mind the fact that the best defence is a strong and continuous 

offensive against the enemy's bases and sea communications. The 

selection and position of our bases should, therefore, be such as 

to assist offensive action. These primary requirements are:- 

(a) Security of sea communications; 

(b) Security from invasion; and 

(c) Security from long range bombing from adjacent islands and 

sporadic raids. 

Security of Sea Communications 

8\. It is obvious that, unless we are able to protect the sea 

routes linking Australia with the outside world and so ensure the 

arrival of reinforcements and supplies, our local resources would 

eventually be exhausted. The operation of our armed forces and 

essential industries would be hampered and restricted through lack 

of essential requirements such as fuel and we should be in danger 

of falling a victim to the enemy. 

9\. The main ocean supply routes are open to attack by the enemy at 

great distances from Australia, e.g. in the middle of the Pacific 

or Indian Oceans, or alternatively at focal points near Australia. 

Such attacks may be carried out by powerful naval units, raiders, 

submarines, and long range bombers, and protection must be 

provided against all these dangers. In order to operate the 

necessary forces to give this protection, bases are required 

strategically placed between the enemy and the shipping routes 

where strong naval and air forces can be stationed to give cover 

to the lighter forces such as cruisers, aircraft carriers, and 

anti-submarine vessels which are required for the protection of 

our convoys. Without this cover, our escorts would be driven from 

the sea by powerful enemy units and our shipping would be left to 

the mercy of the enemy. 

10\. In this war, the main bases used for this purpose in the 

Pacific and Indian Oceans include the following:-

Pacific: Pearl Harbour, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Solomon 

Islands. 

Indian: Kilindini, Ceylon. 

These bases not only provide a cover for our defensive escorts but 

also enable striking forces to attack the enemy's bases and his 

lines of communication. 

11\. The establishment of any operational base would involve the 

provision of major defence works, including seaward and fixed 

defences, aerodromes, installations for the repair and maintenance 

of equipment and reserves of equipment and stores as well as 

substantial Navy, Army and Air Forces as a garrison. 

Security from Invasion 

12\. The best means of securing Australia from invasion is by 

taking strong offensive action from established and well defended 

forward bases. If, however, an enemy were sufficiently powerful to 

seize, hold and develop island bases adjacent to Australia from 

which an invasion supported by a strong force of land based and 

carrier borne aircraft could be launched against the mainland, it 

would be beyond our power to prevent a landing in strength at all 

points along the 12,000 mile coastline. It would, however, be 

possible, by a suitable disposition of our air and land forces and 

by well organized air and land transport, to provide a substantial 

degree of protection at vital points which would naturally be the 

most attractive to the enemy as affording him the opportunity to 

gain the quick decision that would be necessary for him before 

overseas reinforcements could be brought up. Accordingly, to 

provide advanced positions for offensive operations by our naval 

and air forces, to prevent the enemy establishing bases in a 

suitable position for an invasion force to assemble, and at the 

same time to provide our forces with bases to cut across the 

enemy's lines of communication, it is considered advisable that 

well defended bases should be available from the north-west to the 

north-east of Australia. Further, the possession of such bases, 

constituting as they would a threat to the enemy's lines of 

communication in the event of an attempted invasion, would operate 

as a real deterrent to his making such an attempt. 

Security from Long Range Bombing and Sporadic Raids 

13\. It is considered necessary to provide protection against long 

range bombing from bases within one thousand miles of Australia's 

industrial centres. This can be most effectively done by the 

holding of ,strategically placed bases at a considerable distance 

from such centres in the neighbourhood of the areas from which 

bombing might be possible. 

14\. Sporadic raids, i.e. bombardment by surface vessels or bombing 

by carrier home aircraft and raids of a commando type having as 

their main object destruction of installations followed by a quick 

withdrawal, could also be countered from such forward bases.

Selection of Bases 

15\. In the light of these primary defence requirements, it is 

considered that it is necessary to choose bases which will, so far 

as possible, serve at the one time the several purposes of.-

(a) affording opportunity for offensive action;

(b) facilitating the rapid transfer of the armed forces of the 

nations concerned with the defence of the South and Southwest 

Pacific regions to permit of concentrations for operational 

purposes;

(c) protecting sea communications;

(d) safeguarding against invasion; and

(e) safeguarding against bombing and sporadic raids.

The bases chosen should provide harbour facilities for naval 

forces, a large number of air strips for the operation of strong 

air forces, and should be so situated and adapted that they lend 

themselves to effective land defence. 

PARTICULAR SUBJECTS 

16\. With the foregoing general considerations in mind, and subject 

to more detailed examination by the interested powers of the bases 

to be selected, the Defence Committee submits the following views 

upon the particular subjects upon which information is sought.

Bases in Southwest Pacific Area which must be controlled by 

Australia 

17\. In the north-west, it is considered that although Darwin 

should constitute the main base for the defence of Australia and 

for offensive operations against enemy bases and lines of 

communication, its effectiveness would be greatly enhanced by the 

control of an advanced base in an area such as Timor for the 

operation of air squadrons in particular. The possession of such a 

base would add greatly to the range of offensive naval and air 

operations and its denial to the enemy would remove a threat 

which, as experience shows, prevents the full use of

Darwin as a naval base and ties down considerable land and air 

forces. 

18\. In the north-east, it is considered that, in addition to other 

bases in Australian Mandated Territories, a strong naval and air 

base protected by an adequate garrison should be established in an 

area such as the Admiralty islands. Such a location would be 

preferable to Rabaul for a number of reasons, including the 

following- 

(a) it is the most northerly situation available and, if bypassed, 

would constitute a continuous threat to enemy lines of 

communication;

(b) it has a better harbour available;

(c) there would be no danger to installations from volcanic 

disturbances;

(d) it is more easily protected in that it could not be approached 

by successive steps along the coast but would have to be directly 

assaulted from the sea. 

19\. It is considered necessary that arrangements should be made 

for the establishment and maintenance of such bases and that 

action should not be deferred until an emergency arises.

Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be 

controlled by a friendly power

20\. The Defence Committee considers that in view of the geo 

graphical position of the Netherlands East Indies, it is necessary 

for the safety of Australia that these Islands should be in the 

possession of a friendly power and that strong bases (including a 

base at Sourabaya) should be established for their protection to 

prevent them being used as stepping stones for an attack upon 

Australia.

21\. A base in the Solomon Islands - New Hebrides Area is 

considered important to the security of Australia, but in view of 

her limited resources, Australia may not be fully able to maintain 

this base, having regard to other essential commitments. It is 

considered, however, that Australia should contribute to the 

maintenance of the base to the fullest possible extent and that 

the New Zealand and the United Kingdom Governments should also 

contribute. It is also considered that New Zealand should maintain 

a base in Fiji.

22\. The question of a base in New Caledonia requires special 

consideration. A base on the Island would be useful for the 

purpose of naval and air operations, but its main importance would 

be to deny the use of the Island to an enemy. In the hands of an 

enemy, it would constitute a direct threat to Australia's vital 

centres. The Defence Committee considers that arrangements should 

be made for Australia to have access to facilities in New 

Caledonia to ensure that it does not fall into the hands of an 

enemy.

Extent to which Australia could maintain Bases

23\. Apart from the naval commitments involved, it is thought that 

it should not be beyond the capacity of Australia to maintain the 

bases which it is considered must be controlled by Australia. The 

naval commitment should be regarded as an Imperial obligation in 

which Australia should participate so far as her resources permit, 

having regard to the necessity for the maintenance of a balanced 

Defence Force. The Defence Committee felt that any consideration 

of the detailed questions of what would be involved in cost and 

manpower in providing for such bases cannot be undertaken at 

present.

Mutual Defence Problems and Interests of Australia and New Zealand

24\. The maintenance of the integrity of each country is of vital 

concern to the other. In particular, Australia and New Zealand are 

mutually concerned with the establishment and maintenance of the 

bases previously referred to to the north-east and east of 

Australia and to the maintenance by naval and air forces of sea 

communications in the Tasman Sea.

Desirable Forms of Mutual Assistance

25\. It is considered that in addition to what has been mentioned 

previously co-operation between Australia and New Zealand for 

defence should be developed along the following lines:-

(a) the organization, equipping, training and exercising the armed 

forces under a common doctrine;

(b) joint planning;

(c) interchange of staff,

(d) the co-ordination of policy for the production of munitions, 

aircraft, shipping and supply items to ensure the greatest 

possible degree of mutual aid consistent with the maintenance of 

the policy of self-sufficiency in local production.

Defence Problems connected with Civil Air Transport

26\. It is considered that the main problem from the point of view 

of defence in the development of air transport in the Southwest 

and South Pacific Areas is to ensure that air transport routes are 

strategically disposed for defence and can be defended. Even where 

such routes are not the most economical, it is considered that 

they should be developed at any rate as alternatives. Only 

friendly powers should be permitted to conduct air transport 

services within these areas.

International Security System in Western Pacific

27\. It is considered that in an area stretching from Singapore to 

Fiji it is imperative that there should be an effective system of 

international security which would involve joint responsibility by 

the nations concerned for a coordinated defence plan. Under such a 

plan, each participant should undertake definite obligations and 

accept responsibility for the defence of a defined area, but such 

a division of responsibility should be accompanied by arrangements 

for active co-operation including the common use of bases within 

the defined areas. So far as Australia and New Zealand are 

concerned, the meeting of the naval commitments involved in 

defending the areas allotted to them would require to be the 

subject of a common Imperial defence policy. It is appreciated 

that the foregoing are matters for inter-Governmental discussion 

of the Pacific settlement.
