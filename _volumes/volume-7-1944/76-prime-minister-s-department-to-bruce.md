# 76 Prime Minister's Department to Bruce

## Cablegram 37 CANBERRA, 14 March 1944

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your telegram No. 38[A]. [1] in the circumstances answer which you should give orally to Dulanty [2] is that the Australian Government cannot see its way clear to intervene at Mr. de Valera's [3] request because it would give us great gratification if Eire not only removed the German and Japanese representatives but actually declared a state of war with both those countries.

Having regard to the need for great care in the drafting of any written rejoinder we think it desirable that the United Kingdom and the United States, who are now aware of the approach to Australia and the form in which the approach has been made, should be orally informed by you of the reply which we have given.
