# 7 Cranborne to Commonwealth Government

Cablegram 12 LONDON, 7 January 1944, 1.40 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Your telegram 2nd January No. 2. [1]

We think that the United States Government must surely be aware of 

the position of the Commonwealth Government in this matter as set 

out in your letter of 5th July last to Secretary of State for 

Foreign Affairs. [2] The Communique addressed to the Portuguese 

Government on the subject of Australia's special interests and the 

Portuguese reply was included in the Documents constituting the 

Azores Agreement of which a copy was enclosed in my despatch D. 

No. 103 of the 30th November. [3] A copy of these Documents have 

been communicated to the United States Government. In the 

circumstances we do not feel that the brief phrase relating to 

Timor included in the latest Communique to the United States 

Government regarding the proposed Staff conversations with the 

Portuguese is capable of leading to any misunderstanding. We are 

glad to note that you are ready to take part in Staff 

conversations and will communicate further with you when we 

receive the United States Government's reply.
