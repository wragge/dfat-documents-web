# 73 Bruce to Curtin

Cablegram 38[A] LONDON, 9 March 1944, 7.20 p.m.

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

For the Prime Minister.

In my telegram 31[A] of 29th [February] [1] my intention was to make it clear that Dulanty's [2] visit to me was an official one for the purpose of giving me an official message from his Prime Minister [3] for transmission to you. Dulanty and I were merely the convenient medium of connection owing to there being no representation either in Dublin or Canberra of the respective Governments. I am afraid, in view of Evatt's telegram 32 of 9th March [4], I cannot have made it clear that this was the position.

In any event Dulanty has been on the telephone to me this afternoon and it will be necessary for me to give him an official reply.

The alternative replies are that I should inform Dulanty that I have communicated with my Government and have been instructed to inform him either that- (1) My Government does not see its way to acquiesce in Mr. de Valera's request that the Australian Government should intervene with a view to having the American note [5] withdrawn, or (2) That the Australian Government is in accord with the American request for the removal of the German and Japanese representatives and hopes that the Eire Government will see its way to agree to it.

In the case of (1) the reply could, I think, be conveyed orally.

in the case of (2) it would be necessary, in my view, to send Dulanty a written communication which I suggest would have to be very carefully drafted down similar lines to the Canadian reply.

In considering which of these two courses should be adopted, the fact which I have now ascertained has to be borne in mind that both the United Kingdom and the United States of America Governments are aware of the approach to Australia and are awaiting with considerable interest what reply is returned.

Not unnaturally the hope of both is that the Australian reply will be down similar lines to that of the Canadian Government thus presenting a solid front on this issue.
