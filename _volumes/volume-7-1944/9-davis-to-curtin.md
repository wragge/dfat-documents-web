# 9 Davis to Curtin

## Letter [CANBERRA], 10 January 1944

Relative to the proposed Agreement between Canada and Australia in 

connection with the furnishing of Mutual Aid by Canada to 

Australia, under our Mutual Aid policy, I was instructed on 

January 6th to deliver a message to you from my Prime Minister.

I found upon inquiry that you were in Western Australia and would 

not return until the 17th and that therefore it would be 

impossible for me to deliver this message to you personally before 

that date. I communicated this information to Ottawa and have now 

been instructed to deliver the message to you immediately. The 

message from the Prime Minister of Canada to you is as follows:

'Your High Commissioner in Ottawa has informed me that the 

Australian Cabinet is unable to accept the proposed Article X of 

the Mutual Aid Agreement between our two countries. [1] I greatly 

regret this decision and hope you will find it possible to 

reconsider the position. We have considered the suggestion, that 

there might be substituted for this Article, a reference in the 

preamble to the effect that Australia and Canada have accepted in 

principle the general objectives set forth in the Atlantic Charter 

and in Article VII of the master Lend-Lease Agreement. We feel 

however, that we cannot agree to this alternative, as the question 

appears to us of greater importance than would be implied by a 

mere general reference of this character.

It seems to us logical and indeed essential that the Mutual Aid 

Agreements should contain a re-affirmation of the main points of 

general international economic policy which we are all pledged to 

pursue after the war by our acceptance of the Atlantic Charter and 

by the formal undertakings into which we have entered with the 

Government of the United States. Our Mutual Aid policy and Act 

were deliberately formulated to fit into post-war economic inter 

national relations of this character and to make them more 

workable by eliminating the accumulation of large war debts among 

the United Nations. The Canadian Parliament and people have 

accepted the heavy financial burden of Mutual Aid with this 

expectation in view.

It is for this reason that we believe it is essential that all our 

Mutual Aid Agreements should contain an assurance that the nations 

receiving this assistance also look forward to international 

economic relations of this character. We had naturally believed 

that Australia and the other countries participating in Mutual Aid 

subscribed to the principles in question because they had so 

declared in their agreements with the United States. [2] If under 

these circumstances the Government of Australia should not find it 

possible to reconsider their decision not to re-affirm their 

support of these principles we would be obliged to consider that 

the Government of Australia is out of sympathy with the general 

philosophy behind the Mutual Aid policy and therefore that its 

requirements from Canada would have to be obtained on some other 

basis.

We have, of course, no desire or intention that the flow of 

essential war supplies to Australia from Canada should be 

interrupted. If, however, your Government is not ready to sign the 

agreement, we consider we must make new arrangements for the 

financing of these supplies. The only alternative appears to be 

that we should provide essential supplies under a credit to be 

repaid within an appropriate period after the war.

Under any such arrangement it would be necessary, as you will 

realize, to make a public explanation of the reasons which have 

prevented us from fulfilling our intention of providing essential 

supplies to Australia out of the Mutual Aid vote without cost to 

the Australian Government.'

T. C. DAVIS
