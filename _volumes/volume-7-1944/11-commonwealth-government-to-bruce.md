# 11 Commonwealth Government to Bruce

Cablegram 366 CANBERRA, 13 January 1944

SECRET

POLAND-U.S.S.R.

1\. You will recall strong interest expressed in this question in 

telegram No. 202 to Dominions Office of 4th August, 1943. [1] We 

assume that, with crossing of the 1939 Polish boundary by Soviet 

forces, renewed efforts are being made to find a solution to the 

Russo-Polish problem. Press reports speak of meetings between Eden 

and Polish Prime Minister. [2]

2\. We have had no information on this subject and in view of our 

responsibilities' we are concerned at the development of events. 

Polish Prime Minister's statement of 6th January [4] suggests that 

rapprochement is unlikely and we do not need to stress grave 

embarrassment which would result if an understanding were reached 

between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States 

of America as to the future frontiers of Eastern Poland without 

the knowledge of the Australian Government.

3\. Please represent to Eden our urgent wish to be kept fully 

informed of all stages of present discussions.
