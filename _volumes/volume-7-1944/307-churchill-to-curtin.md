# 307 Churchill to Curtin

Cablegram 262 [1] LONDON, 1 October 1944, 5.32 a.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE PERSONAL PRIVATE AND TOP SECRET

From the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister.

My D.No. 1478. [2]

1\. I feel very strongly that we ought not to invite Eire into the bosom of the British Commonwealth on a side issue like this where our hand has been forced by the casual action of medium officials in the State Department. The President was shocked when he heard what had been done. It would be a great pity to cancel the Ottawa conference, but I would rather face this than smirch the opportunity which the future may hold in store for us for an Irish settlement. I hope you will understand.
