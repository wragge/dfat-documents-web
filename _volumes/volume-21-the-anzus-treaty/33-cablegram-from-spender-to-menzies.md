# 33 Cablegram From Spender to Menzies

Cablegram, Canberra, 18 January 1951

363\. IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET PERSONAL

I have been advised by the United States Embassy of Dulles' proposal to you that he come to Australia about February 15th to discuss the Japanese Peace Treaty and the question of a security arrangement in the Pacific.

2\. I think that a discussion of this kind is the only way of getting to grips with the problem and I suggest that you agree to the proposal.
