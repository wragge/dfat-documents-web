## Cablegram, Canberra, 1 September 1951

Three Power Security Pact Following is text of message requested. Begins: Please convey to those present an expression of the great satisfaction with which we have become parties to this historic pact. Stop. Your own constant labours did much to produce the result which has I am sure the warm approval of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. Stop. The Pact is conceived in no spirit of hostility, on the contrary it embodies an enduring spirit of friendship and cooperation. Ends.[2]

_ 1 In Cablegram 22 (30 August) Spender suggested that Menzies should send a message that he might read at dinner on 1 September to mark the occasion of the signature of the Security Treaty.
