# 34 Cablegram From Department of External Affairs to Embassy in Washington

Cablegram, Canberra, 18 January 1951

37\. IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your 8[1] and 66.[2]

Pacific Pact.

We shall review situation within the next few days in the light of any discussions the Prime Minister and Secretary may have had in London.

2\. In the meantime, you can assume that the New Zealand Government is aware of the Australian approach. You will recall that we told Berendsen in New York of the discussions that were going on. There has been no discussion with New Zealand since then. We have not advised the United Kingdom of Australia's approach and, until we can inform you of the nature of the Secretary's discussions in London, you should assume that they are unaware that the proposal has been put formally to the United States.

_ 1 Presumably Cablegram 8 (9 January) to Washington (see note 1 to Document 30).

2 Document 30.
