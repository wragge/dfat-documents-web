# 171 Cablegram From Westerman To Stuart

22nd November, 1956

326 SECRET IMMEDIATE

CANBERRA

Your 389.

Your detailed report on discussions with Yoshino appreciated.

However, I am disturbed at the views which you are expressing on the likely attitude of the Australian Government, possible compromises and so on. I have arranged for you to be kept fully briefed on the progress of the negotiations for your background information and not for use in discussions with Japanese officials. I would therefore ask you to refrain from giving your interpretation of the Australian attitude unless specifically requested by us to do so. In the absence of such a request your advice should be confined to the supply of factual information.

You will appreciate that it is tactically unsound to become involved in simultaneous negotiations in Canberra and Tokyo.

Therefore in any further approaches you should endeavour to obtain Japanese reactions without commenting on likely Australian view.

1 Watt cabled Tange on 23 November, noting that he had already given similar instructions to Stuart, with whom he had had lengthy discussions concerning Document 169 before sending Document 170.
