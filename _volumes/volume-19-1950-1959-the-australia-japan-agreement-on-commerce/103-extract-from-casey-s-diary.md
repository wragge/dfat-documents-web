# 103 Extract From Casey's Diary

## 24th May, 1955

CANBERRA

I saw Haruhiko Nishi this morning. He leaves Canberra tonight and Sydney tomorrow for Tokyo at the end of his time here-before he goes to London as Japanese Ambassador. We have exchanged civil letters. He has done very well here in many ways and the Australian/Japanese feeling is a great deal better than it was when he arrived 2 1/2 years ago.
