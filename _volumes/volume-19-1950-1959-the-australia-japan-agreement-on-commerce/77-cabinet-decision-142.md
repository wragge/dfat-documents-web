# 77 Cabinet Decision 142

## 13th October, 1954

CANBERRA

Submission No. 135-Import Licensing of Japanese Goods [1]

Cabinet agreed in principle that a policy of 'limited assimilation' should be adopted in relation to imports from Japan.

It noted that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs proposed to discuss the proposal with the Minister and also with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and to submit to them the list of goods which it was thought might be excluded from 'assimilation' for the present.

It noted further that consideration would be given the matter on receipt of their views.
