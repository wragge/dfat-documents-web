# 67 Decision 53(Pm) Of Prime Minister's Committee Of Cabinet

## 17th August, 1954

CANBERRA

Submission No. 30-Australian Policy Towards Japan The Committee inclined to the opinion that, in handling issues involving our relations with Japan, Australia should give special attention to the need to prevent the formation of a close alliance between Japan and Communist China; and that Australia should be guided by the principle of allowing Japan, through co-operation with non-communist nations, to have reasonable facilities for taking a part in her own defence, for meeting her economic difficulties by expanding her export trade, and for developing her political and economic life and institutions in a way that will strengthen Japan's association with the West.
