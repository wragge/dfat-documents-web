# 93 Note Verbale From Japanese Embassy To Department Of External

## 30th December, 1954

CANBERRA

AFFAIRS

No. 141 The Embassy of Japan presents its compliments to the Department of External Affairs and, with reference to the Note 731/3/9 of the Right Honourable Minister of State for External Affairs addressed to the Ambassador of Japan dated November 17,1954 [1], has the honour to state, under instructions from the Japanese Government, that the Note is under careful study of the Japanese Government.

In view, however, of the period of time which has elapsed since Japan proposed trade negotiation with Australia as early as November last year, the Japanese Government feels it the way to serve the purpose of the trade talks to consider afresh the Australian proposal in the light of the prevailing circumstances.

In a belief that the Australian Government would share the above feeling, the Embassy would like to mention that the lack of any concrete references in the Note to the matters which the Australian Government has in its mind for discussion with Japan at the proposed talks renders it difficult for the Japanese Government to determine at this moment its attitude towards the Australian Note. Accordingly, with a view to expediting the deliberations on the part of the Japanese Government, the Embassy has the honour to request the Australian Government to be kind enough to elaborate further upon the Australian idea in this respect.

In putting forward the above request, the attention of the Embassy has been drawn to the announcement of the Australian Government on November 17 in which the Australian Government indicated to reserve its position on the application of the G.A.T.T. principles to Australian trade relations with Japan. In a sincere desire to promote trade between the two countries on an equitable as well as stable basis, the Embassy would like to emphasize again that the Japanese Government looks forward confidently to prompt and full support of the Australian Government to Japan's accession to G.A.T.T.
