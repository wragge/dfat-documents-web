Cablegram 48 CANBERRA, 11 February 1947

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Peace Treaty with Germany.

Reference Dominions Office telegrams D.117 and D.118 [1] and telegram 55 [2] External Affairs Officer, London.

You should see Addison immediately and press for full United Kingdom support for our views on procedure as set out in our telegram 14 of 13th January. In particular United Kingdom proposals fall short of conference of allied belligerents which can make decisions and there is no indication of United Kingdom attitude towards our proposal for an interim agreement.

 _

1 These cables of 8 February from Addison to the Australian Government stated that the United Kingdom would press for a German peace treaty based on consultation by the Council of Foreign Ministers with other belligerents but would not press for a full conference of all belligerents.

2 Cable 55 of 10 February from Bridgland to the Department of External Affairs asked if the information in Addison's cables called for reaction in London.
