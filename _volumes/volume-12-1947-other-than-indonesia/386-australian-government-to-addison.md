Cablegram 106 CANBERRA, 26 April 1947, 1.05 p.m.

Your 83 New Zealand 70.

1\. Our representative at F.E.C. will strongly protest at stab in the dark procedure which can only be described as auction block of self interest. We will urge careful working out of reparations available and scheme of distribution based on justice taking into consideration physical losses and personal injury of servicemen and internees and also relative contribution to victory.

2\. We would suggest a tribunal of three independent and preferably judicial persons to make necessary investigations.
