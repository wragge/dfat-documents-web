Cablegram unnumbered HMAS HOBART, 4 August 1947, 8.30 a.m.

SECRET

Pending my return and further instructions, F.E.C. decision on Japanese whaling should not be pressed by Australia. At the same time Australia should not herself take steps to request postponement. [1]

 _

On 4 September the subject of Japanese whaling was removed from the Commission's agenda with the unanimous agreement of FEC members. Debate was effectively silenced until the United States foreshadowed plans for a 1948-49 expedition.

1 Chifley reported this decision to Attlee in reply to Document 404.
