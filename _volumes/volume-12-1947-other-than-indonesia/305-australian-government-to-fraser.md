Cablegram 108 CANBERRA, 15 April 1947, 2.05 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE

We propose sending the following reply to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in reply to D367. Begins:

1\. As you are no doubt aware, Mr. Bevin was informed by the Australian Charge d'Affaires at Moscow of our intention to propose Commonwealth consultation regarding Japanese settlement as early as practicable. We had already discussed the suggestion with New Zealand who agree to Australia calling such a conference of members of the British Commonwealth prior to making our view known to the United States Government and prior to discussion in F.E.C.

2.We interpret your D367 as agreement with principle of our suggestion already put to Mr. Bevin.

3\. In these circumstances and having in mind the special position of Australia and New Zealand in relation to the settlement with Japan and Australian representation of our common interests in Tokyo we would prefer to invite British Commonwealth Governments to Canberra during May to discuss procedure and substance of the Japanese settlement. We think there are tangible advantages in a Pacific meeting place.

4\. We would like your comments as a matter of urgency. Ends.

We would appreciate your comments on this draft as soon as possible.
