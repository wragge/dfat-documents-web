Cablegram 375 CANBERRA, 15 July 1947

SECRET

Your UN.648. New members.

Support Portugal and Eire as nations having records of support for aims and ideals of United Nations.

Transjordan. Do not support if it appears likely that we will be in minority, but we would not wish to cause their rejection if voting close. We are not convinced of Transjordanian independence.

Outer Mongolia. Oppose unless they appear likely to be admitted.

Independence in international relations not proved.

Albania. Oppose unless Albania gives assurances of co-operation with Border Commission, and in any event until decision of Council on Balkans is made.
