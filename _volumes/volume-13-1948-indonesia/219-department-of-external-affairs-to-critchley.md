# 219 Department of External Affairs to Critchley

Cablegram 206 CANBERRA, 3 August 1948

SECRET

We have been advised by Netherlands Minister here that action will be taken very shortly to declare 'Communist activity' illegal in Indonesia. Minister gave assurance that this would not be directed against Republic as such but against certain cells within Republican regime.

2\. He was advised informally that in our view the only way of preventing the spread of Communist influence is by making immediate settlement with present moderate Republican Government.

3\. Please report fully on any action that is taken.
