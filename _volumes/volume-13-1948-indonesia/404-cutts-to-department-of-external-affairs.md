# 404 Cutts to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K216 BATAVIA, 20 December 1948

IMMEDIATE SECRET

From the scanty military information available it appears that:

(a) Dutch troops from East Sumatra have moved into the Asahan area;

(b) Dutch have crossed the status quo line in South Sumatra, probably in a drive on Djambi;

(c) Dutch are 'expanding' from Padang in West Sumatra;

(d) Tjepoe (Central Java oilfields) has been captured by Dutch following landings on the North Coast of Central Java and an airborne operation;

(e) Dutch troops which crossed the status quo line at Gombong (Central Java) are moving towards Djokjakarta.

2\. It was announced today that the Government of East Indonesia has resigned but is carrying on its functions pending formation of a new cabinet, and that Adil Puradiredja has resigned as Prime Minister of Pasundan.

3\. The Netherlands Delegation has not been dissolved as indicated in para. 4 of K213. [1] However, Schuurman's instructions make it clear that preparations are being made for such a step.
