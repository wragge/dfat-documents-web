# 148 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 63 THE HAGUE, 25 May 1948, 4.10 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

INDONESIA

My telegram 61. [1]

I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and spoke on the lines of your telegram 38. [2]

2\. The Minister listened carefully and took notes. He took, as I expected, the line that delays were due to Republicans rather than the Dutch and repeated his former assurances that the Dutch wanted and were determined to have a free Indonesia, but could not agree to the Republic dictating the lines on which it was to be established.

3\. He denied that there was a blockade or anything more than proper measures to prevent smuggling. I pressed him for specific details of controls and regulations and some assurance that channels of trade would be freed.

4\. I gave him a note, the contents of your telegram 39. [3] He appeared friendl[il]y disposed to the enterprise but said it was being discussed with Batavia (apparently on the basis of report from Teppema).

5\. Finally the Minister said he would like to consider my representations and send for me for a further discussion in a few days time.

6\. After leaving the Minister I saw Secretary General and repeated my represen-tations to him.
