Cablegram 339 CANBERRA, 31 December 1948, 8 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Your 517. [1] We would be quite willing to forward such a message but it adds nothing to and in fact does not go as far as what we have already said at Council. If other countries react favourabl[y] and India wishes us to join with them in sending message we would be very pleased to do so.
