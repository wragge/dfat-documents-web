He also stated that United States taking initiative in attempting to bring United Kingdom and France into line through Embassies in London and Paris. He considered that such an alignment was vital to further successful action in Council.

He expressed the view that reference to Court might serve a useful purpose particularly as Dutch would probably be inclined to abide by its decision.

He stressed the importance of not forgetting the main objectives viz. establishment of peaceful United States of Indonesia and said there had been some indications that some of the Indonesian leaders might still co-operate to that end despite Dutch action.

He fully appreciated the unfortunate effect that Soviet initiative might have in South East Asia, but stressed that that was unfortunately only one of a number of considerations.
