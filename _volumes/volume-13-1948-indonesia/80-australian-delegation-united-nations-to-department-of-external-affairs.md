# 80 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN161 NEW YORK, 20 February 1948, 11.15 p.m.

SECRET

Security Council today 20th continued Indonesia debate which may conclude tomorrow morning- Following is outline of statements [1]:-

Austin (U.S.A.). Parties having agreed it is hoped it will not be necessary for parties to come back to Council with a dispute but rather that agreement be secured on the spot with assistance of Committee. Word 'assist' in resolution0f 25th August not passive.

Expressed faith that parties will fulfil principles in good faith, mentioning plebiscites particularly. 'Demarcation lines will disappear'. Inconceivable that either party would delay or wear down by attrition. (Speech lacked definiteness. No support to Kirby's suggestion that Committee should take initiative by making public suggestions to parties).

Pillai (India). Criticised principles e.g. sovereignty and transmission by Dutch of request for continuance of Committee.

Full support given to Kirby's suggestion on which Council should give some indication of approval.

Tsiang (China). Agreed with Sastroamijojo that Committee had achieved first significant United Nations success, but that Renville not entirely satisfactory to Republic. Principles good but difficulties of interpretation may arise as after Linggadjati.

No new states should be set up before plebiscites. Committee should be strengthened. Kirby suggestion should be incorporated or given recognition in the resolution. Committee should be authorised to arbitrate as to differences in interpretation of principles.

Parodi (France). Necessary result has been secured. Prudence has been factor in success and Council should not change basis of Committee. Method of work should be left to Committee. Publicity obtainable by transmitting suggestions to Council. Condition resolution support. [2]

Cadogan (United Kingdom). Referred to previous doubts of competence of Council. Now admitted that Renville was real success. Supported Kirby suggestion but unnecessary to insert in resolution as he understands two parties accept the suggestion.

Opposed Chinese suggestion of arbitration of questions of interpretation because Committee would lose 'good offices' character. Wholly in favour of resolution.

Ukraine. Armed intervention of Dutch, British and Japanese forces in Indonesia created threat to peace. Dutch promises have been only smokescreen for preparations for war on Republic. Setting up of Committee complicated the situation to disadvantage of Republic. Inequality of the parties. Charged Britain and United States of America with giving Dutch direct assistance, military, diplomatic and financial in order to preserve colonial system.

Dutch have also had loan from International Bank. Committee threatened as in Gromyko's speech e.g. 'Gave legal character to Dutch aggression'. Council should denounce Committee's work.

2 This sentence presumably should read: 'Canadian resolution [i.e.

Document 68] supported'.
