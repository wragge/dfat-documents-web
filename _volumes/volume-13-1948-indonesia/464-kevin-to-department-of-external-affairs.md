# 464 Kevin to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 510 NEW DELHI, 24 December 1948, 11.05 p.m.

My immediately preceding telegram.

Following is the text.

Begins- I have asked several of my Indonesia colleagues to come here to discuss the situation. We are glad to have had the opportunity to see Pandit Nehru for 30 minutes. It is now clear that India, Pakistan and Burma will indeed not remain idle spectators in the present Dutch military, aggression. These three countries are prepared to take strong measures which I am sorry I cannot disclose as yet. Whatever steps had already been taken are already in the press. And whatever stronger measures will be taken depend upon the decision of the Security Council. I am glad of the news that Australia has already expressed her feelings in a most strong manner. Public opinion all over the world is now very strongly against the Dutch and we can expect in the very near future the closing of any kind of Dutch communication transport from the Middle East down to Australia. In Indonesia the people are determined to carry on the struggle for any period by the means of guerrilla warfare and I am sure they will be all the more so determined after hearing of insulting treatment President Soekarno and the other leaders have received from the Dutch.

Ends.
