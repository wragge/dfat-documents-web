# 422 Senanayake to Chifley

Cablegram 84 COLOMBO, 21 December 1948, 8.50 p.m.

SECRET

The Government of Ceylon views with grave concern the news that the Netherlands Government had renewed the 'police action' in Indonesia and is extremely anxious about the deplorable consequences this action is likely to have in South-East Asia. The political developments between the Governments of the Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic which have led to this precipitate step in the face of the peaceful solution which the Committee of Good Offices of the United Nations were exploring are not known to us fully. But we cannot believe that an amicable settlement was impossible and the use of force was necessary. Public opinion in Ceylon will not tolerate the use of the harbour and aerodrome facilities by ships and planes carrying troops, arms or warlike materials of any kind which may be used in the reconquest of the Indonesian Republic. Steps are accordingly being taken to deny such facilities in Ceylon to the Government of Netherlands.
