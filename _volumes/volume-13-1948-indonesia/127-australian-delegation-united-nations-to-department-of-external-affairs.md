# 127 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram UN409 NEW YORK, 7 May 1948, 4.19 p.m.

Indonesia. Reference our UN383. [1]

'New York Times' this morning reports Mahomed Roem has stated that Dr. Choa had acted without instruction and that his unofficial statements did not reflect view of Republican delegation.

We understand from Palar that Republican delegation undertook to approach Security Council only through good offices committee. In his view this was a mistake in that it forfeits one advantage of February resolution. (Please note very confidential nature of this comment).
