# 345 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Austdel 317 PARIS, 3 December 1948, 1.18 p.m.

SECRET

Indonesia.

Fourth Interim Report by Good Offices Commission [1] was distributed today. Indonesian Representative sees in fact that general tone of report is much more favourable to the Indonesians than to the Dutch an opportunity to intensify publicity campaign particularly in United States with double objective of drawing attention to continued uncertainty of situation in Indonesia and to bring pressure to bear on Dutch to prevent military action in event of negotiations coming to standstill.

2\. Indonesians here still do not exclude possibility of police action and would regard period following return home of Dutch Mission from Batavia as critical.

3\. Americans desire still to keep matter off Agenda of Security Council in order to allow full exercise of diplomatic pressure and avoid prejudice of negotiations by acrimonious discussion.

American delegation believes that Chinese or Indian representatives may however seek discussion of report in Council.
