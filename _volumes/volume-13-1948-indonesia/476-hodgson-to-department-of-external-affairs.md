# 476 Hodgson to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 292 PARIS, [26 December 1948], 6.50 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

Your P.298. [1]

1\. Paragraph 2. We have been in contact throughout but it should be remembered that with the Argentine, China, Ukraine, and United Kingdom, Canada is represented by an alternate [2] unfamiliar with the case and therefore closely bound to instructions. Direct approach in Ottawa therefore much more likely to produce results.

2\. Paragraph 4. Reference to United Kingdom not properly understood as they supported both the cease-fire, withdrawal and stop-gap Canadian proposal.

3\. Paragraph 5. Matter not entirely withdrawn and likely to be discussed again tomorrow and later in the week as reports come in from G.O.C. Do not consider that United States of America likely to lose interest as Jessup is very disturbed by the incompleteness of council action to date. The United Kingdom must continue to support the withdrawal if proposed again after their vote last week. 4. Paragraph 7. SECRET. Likely to Produce positive results in the Council if G.O.C. were able to report as soon as possable as follows.

A. Effect on the strength of the position of the Rebublic in relation to the Netherlands of the cease-fire without a withdrawal.

B. Practicability of withdrawal.

C. Impossibility of observance of even a cease-fire without observers in the field.

D. Extent of Dutch compliance with the cease-fire order (which was of immediate effect) if it was possible to assess this under the circumstances.

E. Concrete suggestions as to the action the Council might take at once- (1) to make its clear condemnation of the Dutch effective by preservation of the Republic as a unit, and (2) to embark on steps for a settlement of the dispute possibly by giving greater powers to G.O.C.
