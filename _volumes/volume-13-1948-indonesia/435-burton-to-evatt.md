# 435 Burton to Evatt

Cablegram E118 CANBERRA, 23 December 1948, 11.30 a.m.

RESTRICTED

Your telegrams. Hodgson reinstructed in strongest terms on receipt message through Heydon. Glad we are so much in accord. Your message to Hodgson very helpful. I am not reporting all our moves but at each centre we are pressing view point. Any messages personally from you to London and Washington would be helpful.
