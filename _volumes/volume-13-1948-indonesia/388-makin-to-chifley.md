State Department has not yet received confirmation from Military Observers that hostilities have been resumed but from tone of notes handed by Dutch to United States at The Hague and in Washington, they assume United Press reports are correct. United States Delegation in Paris has therefore been instructed to seek meeting of Security Council on emergency basis not later than Monday. Jessup has been recalled to Paris to handle the case.
