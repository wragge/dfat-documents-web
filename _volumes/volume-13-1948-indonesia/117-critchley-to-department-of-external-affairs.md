# 117 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram K105 KALIURANG, 20 April 1948

Reference my K.103. Following the issue on 17th of a communique by the Committee of Good Offices that sections of the press had exaggerated the incident at Jogjakarta railway and that the Committee trusted that there would be no further delay in the negotiations, Roem and Abdulkadir held a joint press conference on 18th. Abdulkadir stated he now considered the incident 'definitely closed'. Negotiations were resumed on the 19th in an atmosphere which does not seem to have been impaired by the incident.

'Aneta', the Dutch news agency, however, continues to fulminate.
