# 314 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K190 BATAVIA, 15 November 1948

SECRET

From personal talks with the American Delegation I am convinced that prospects of the early fall of Nanking have greatly strengthened U.S. desire for an early and peaceful settlement in Indonesia. This may prove useful in any further approach to the State Department on the Indonesian question.
