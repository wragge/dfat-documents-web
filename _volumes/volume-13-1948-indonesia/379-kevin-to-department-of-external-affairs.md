IMPORTANT SECRET

Our 492. [1] K.P.S. Menon asked us to call today regarding Indonesian situation, latest Indian views regarding which are contained in my immediately following telegram reproducing a telegram sent by Nehru December 15th to the Indian Ambassador in Washington and Indian High Commissioner in London.

During our conversation Menon said Soekarno would discuss the situation on his arrival in Delhi. He was at some pains to explain that Nehru had said some time ago that he would be glad to see Soekarno here at any time and that a precise invitation was sent only after Soekarno had taken him up on this.
