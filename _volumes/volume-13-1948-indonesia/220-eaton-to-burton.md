# 220 Eaton to Burton

Departmental Dispatch 24/1948 BATAVIA, 4 August 1948

SECRET

GENERAL POLITICAL SITUATION

Reference: Consulate Telegram No.185 dated 24/7/48. [1]

The resolution of the Bandoeng Conference has now been made public and a copy of the resolution as reported by the Republican Press Review is attached hereto. It seems reasonable to assume that a conflict between the States represented at the Conference took place with a result of the right wing States forcing the final resolution which although aimed for an early sovereign Federation of Indonesia was against certain Republican principles and would thus necessitate Republican rejection. This has now occurred.

2\. Dutch political policy in spite of the Committee of Good Offices has now divided Indonesia into three camps which can be played against each other. Firstly there is the Republic always anti-Dutch and now violently so. Secondly the block of States comprising Riouw, Bangka, Billiton, Greater Dajak, West Borneo, South Sumatra and East Sumatra led by the East Sumatran Prime Minister Dr. Mansoer. The leaders of these States are pro-Dutch and willing to submit to the Dutch plan for the future independence of Indonesia. It is significant that this block of States can be bolstered up in number by any new state or autonomous area which can be created by Dutch decree. Thirdly the block of States comprising East Indonesia, West Java, Madura, South-East Borneo, East Borneo and Bandjar led by Anak Agoeng Gde Agoeng, the East Indonesian Prime Minister. This third block although willing to cooperate with the Dutch direct in obtaining independence require full sovereignty by 1/1/1949 which is also to include the Republic.

3\. The resolution which was handed to the Provisional Federal Government, the Lt. Governor General, the Committee of Good Offices and to the Republican Government has now been taken to the Dutch Government at The Hague by Dr. Bahrioen, chairman of the 'conference of heads of states and premiers of the component states' at Bandoeng together with the East Indonesian premier Anak Agoeng Gde Agoeng, West Java (Pasundan) premier Adil Puradiredja and Sultan Hamid II with their secretaries and advisers.

4\. The Republic has therefore now received a severe set back from their own countrymen in respect to their direct negotiations with the Dutch under the auspices of the Committee of Good Offices and realise the strong position the Dutch are in to force a plan for the independence of Indonesia with or without the Republic.

Republican high officials realise too that the Dutch in their present strong position combined with their hatred for the Republic may take extreme political measures directed towards its liquidation and that little or no assistance to their cause can be forthcoming from the latest resolution of the Security Council.

The present hope of the Republic is that the new American member of the Committee of Good Offices, Mr. Merle Cochran, will arrive in Indonesia with a reasonable plan agreed to by the State Department and The Hague which both sides would be forced to agree to.

5\. If a solution for the Republic is not forthcoming at an early date their present internal position cannot be maintained indefinitely and future chaos within the Republic which may spread throughout Indonesia is a distinct possibility. Failing an overall solution the only hope appears for the Republic to be placed on an agreed independent basis from the rest of Indonesia and the basis to ensure economic freedom for overseas trade; another difficult problem as the Republic is without a port outlet in Java.

Govt. will be bound by the limitations resulting from the continued sovereignty of the Netherlands, c. the separate sphere of powers of the Prov. Fed. Govt. itself, d. the sphere of powers of the component of areas, including the powers of the autonomous areas.

6\. Within the sphere referred to in par- 5 sub a. the Netherlands government shall cooperate with the Provisional Federal Government to make the preparations for the transfer of sovereignty of the U.S.I.

14\. The disparities which exist between the component states shall find expression in the number of delegates for the various component states with the proviso that the strength of population shall not be the sole determinant of the number of seats.

15\. In determining the number of seats for each component state, it shall be fixed in advance, that each component state shall be assured of at least two seats, which number can be increased up to ten seats. It shall be regulated in such a manner, that each component state, having a population of 1-20,000 souls, shall have two seats, being the minimum number; and further, either a. for each 15,000-300,000 souls increased with one scat, with a maximum total of 10 seats. or:

19\. The Directorium is responsible for its policy to the Representative Body, with this provision that this body cannot force the Directorium to resign.

20\. The Federal Council is vested with the powers to advise, whether at the request of the Directorium or on its own initiative.

25\. The above bodies of liaison shall in any case be set up for defence, foreign relations and for economic and financial affairs.
