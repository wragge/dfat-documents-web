# 67 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K68 BATAVIA, 14 February 1948, 11 a.m.

SECRET

The Republic has set up a plebiscite Committee under Doctor Ali Boediadjo. The objectives are to publicise in occupied areas the significance and purpose of the plebiscite and impress on the people the importance of choosing the Republic.

2\. The head of the Netherlands police has informed Boediadjo that such a move is premature since the plebiscites will not be held until at least six months after a political agreement has been reached. Our understanding of principle six (S.A.C.10-2-3) [1] is that plebiscites are to be held not less than six or more than twelve months after the Renville agreement of 17th. January. As Kirby knows, however, the wording of the principle leaves room for argument.

3\. It would be useful for Kirby to obtain agreement of the Committee at New York on our understanding and if possible and desirable the support of the Security Council.

4\. In any case there should be no objection to the Republic's initiating a legal and peaceful plebiscite movement as a counter to the present Dutch propaganda. The head of the Police informed Boediadjo that a plebiscite movement before political settlement would be unfair. Kirby may have an opportunity to assist in New York on this point as well.
