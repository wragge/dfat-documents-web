Pro President Security Council: My K.138. [1]

Committee Good Offices has honour forward the following addendum to report cabled 22nd June. [2]

In accordance with request of Republican Delegation that negotiations be continued on the basis of proposals suggested in Australian-United States working paper [3], which had been documented by Committee of Good Offices, paper was placed on provisional agenda of 23rd June meeting of Steering Committee.

When Steering Committee met, however, Netherlands Delegation maintained its objection to discussing paper and refused accept it as agenda item while Republican Delegation pressed strongly for its retention. The Committee of Good Offices which, through its Chairman, has deciding vote in procedural matters, found itself unable to reach unanimous decision, Australian, United States representatives advocating retention of paper on agenda while Belgian representative was opposed.

In these circumstances, the Chairman, stressing the seriousness of the situation, appealed to the Netherlands, Republican Delegations to consult with each other with a view to seeing whether they could not find formula which would enable the paper to be discussed on its merits.

Australian, United States representatives reaffirmed the hope that procedural difficulties would not prevent consideration, as basis for discussion, of these proposals which, in their view at least, defined areas wherein agreement must be reached.
