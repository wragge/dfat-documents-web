1\. Tsiang (China) said reports did not substantiate Van Kleffens' allegation that Republic does not want federation and union but show substantial grounds for Republican charge that Dutch were fostering separatist movements.

Council's desire for stable settlement not at present being achieved. Delays deliberately created to favour Dutch purposes. Quoted United Nations press release SC/681 referred to in our 549. Not noted seriousness of discontinuance of negotiations. [3] Council must retain control of situation and should secure immediate report of suspension and text of document concerned.

Council must deal more actively with Indonesian question and not rely on the Committee.

1[5]. El Khouri (President) pointed out there was no concrete proposal before the Council. He would however cable Committee for report on suspension of negotiations.
