SECRET

Immediately on my return from Djokjakarta Monday evening Dubois and I received a letter from Van Mook in the following terms:-

(1) He does not share our hope that our working paper [1] might prove useful in any conversation between Hatta and himself.

(2) Neither the Committee nor individual members of the Committee should make pronouncements except at the request of both parties.

(3) Documents and especially confidential documents emanating from individual members of the Good Offices Committee cannot be included in report of the Committee as such.

(4) On instructions from his Government neither the Netherlands Delegation nor himself can see their way to take the paper into consideration. [2]
