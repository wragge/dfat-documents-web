# 226 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 107 THE HAGUE, 13 August 1948

[SECRET]

INDONESIA

Drees, speaking in Second Chamber yesterday, said that discussions here with the BANDOENG DELEGATION [1] had strengthened the conviction that agreement would be reached with the representatives of these territories which would lead to (a) the establishment of a truly Indonesian federal interim Government;

(b) the institution of a United States of Indonesia;

(c) the simultaneous formation of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union.

2\. He then referred to disappointing relations with Republicans which he attributed to (a) non-implementation of Renville Agreement, (b) increasing number of violations of truce 'in which Republican authorities have on more than one occasion had a hand'.

3\. He stressed importance of Republicans taking their place in United States of Indonesia and gave an undertaking that Netherlands would honour its obligations.

4\. I regard the speech as rather disappointing but will discuss it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister with both of whom I have appointments early next week.
