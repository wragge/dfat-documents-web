Committee of Good Offices USS RENVILLE, 17 January 1948 Document S/AC.10/CONF.2/3

UNRESTRICTED

The Committee of Good Offices has been informed by the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and by the delegation of the Republic of Indonesia that, the truce agreement having been signed, their Governments accept the following principles on which the political discussions will be based:

1\. That the assistance of the Committee of Good Offices be continued in the working out and signing of an agreement for the settlement of the political dispute in the islands of Java, Sumatra and Madura, based upon the principles underlying the Linggadjati Agreement.

2\. It is understood that neither party has the right to prevent the free expression of popular movements looking toward political organizations which are in accord with the principles of the Linggadjati Agreement. It is further understood that each party will guarantee the freedom of assembly, speech and publication at all times provided that this guarantee is not construed so as to include the advocacy of violence or reprisals.

3\. It is understood that decisions concerning changes in administration of territory should be made only with the full and free consent of the populations of those territories and at a time when the security and freedom from coercion of such populations will have been ensured.

4\. That on the signing of the political agreement provision be made for the gradual reduction of the armed forces of both parties.

5\. That as soon as practicable after the signing of the truce agreement, economic activity, trade, transportation and communications be restored through the cooperation of both parties, taking into consideration the interests of all the constituent parts of Indonesia.

6\. That provision be made for a suitable period of not less than six months nor more than one year after the signing of the agreement, during which time uncoerced and free discussion and consideration of vital issues will proceed. At the end of this period, free elections will be held for self-determination by the people of their political relationship to the United States of Indonesia.

7\. That a constitutional convention be chosen according to democratic procedure to draft a constitution for the United States of Indonesia.

8\. It is understood that if, after signing the agreement referred to in item 1, either party should ask the United Nations to provide an agency to observe conditions at any time up to the point at which sovereignty is transferred from the Government of the Netherlands to the Government of the United States of Indonesia, the other party will take this request in serious consideration.

The following four principles are taken from the Linggadjati Agreement;

9\. Independence for the Indonesian peoples.

10\. Cooperation between the peoples of the Netherlands and Indonesia.

11\. A sovereign state on a federal basis under a constitution which will be arrived at by democratic processes.

12\. A union between the United States of Indonesia and other parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the King of the Netherlands.
