TOP SECRET

Indonesia. Your 912. [1]

1\. Indonesian representative advises that his delegation in Paris have received several cables from Djokjakarta warning of 'grave danger that military action will be renewed very shortly'.

2\. State Department discounts these reports although Lacy said today U.S. periodically warns Netherlands of inadvisability of further police action.

3\. Cochran apparently has forwarded little information on substance of Hatta and Stikker conversations. He has reported, however, that the two leaders got on well personally and that some measure of agreement seems to have been reached. State Department anticipate some development following Dutch cabinet meeting yesterday. In the light of this hopeful development State Department considers police action unlikely at the present time.

The following is a summary of the main points of a report in today's A.N.P. Bulletin which it is claimed emanates from 'competent sources'.

1\. Netherlands Government was yesterday drafting fresh recommendations for continued negotiations with the Republican Government without the mediation of the United Nations Good Offices Committee. These would be forwarded to Stikker's advisers who were in Batavia.

2\. Netherlands Government (it was understood) was compiling a memorandum couching in emphatic terms its attitude towards the present situation. This would be handed to the Republican Government shortly.

3\. The Dutch visualised that new negotiations would be extremely short.

4\. The present uncertain situation could not be tolerated 'much longer' owing to the agreement with non-Republican territories that the interim Government would be established before January 1st 1949.

5\. it was emphatically denied that any agreement had been reached in Djokjakarta between Stikker and Hatta. All talks had been exploratory.

6\. Dutch had continually stipulated as a primary condition for the resumption of discussions (a) immediate cessation of animate violations of the truce (b) resumption of goods traffic between the Republican and non-Republican areas.
