# 261 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 137 THE HAGUE, 1 October 1948

IMPORTANT TOP SECRET

Reference my telegram No. 136.

The first reaction of the Netherlands Government to Cochran proposals was a long juristic document suggesting modifications to almost every clause. On second and wiser thoughts they reduced their objections to two, viz.

(1) the impossibility at present of holding elections to select a constituent body and (2) the need for stronger control over foreign relations.

2\. Now they have gone a step further and decided to accept the proposals, in the same way as the Republic, as a basis for discussion and to put forward the modifications they propose.

3\. I think there is, after a far too long delay, a real chance, with the assistance of the Committee of Good Offices, to secure an agreement.

4\. But when the Secretary General advised me of para 2. this morning, he emphasised that time was short for reports indicate that disorder is increasing every day.
