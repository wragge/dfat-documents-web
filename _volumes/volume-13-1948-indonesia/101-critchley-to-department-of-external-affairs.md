# 101 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K89 BATAVIA, 9 March 1948, 7.15 p.m.

SECRET

Hatta is coming to Batavia on Thursday for personal discussions at the invitation of Van Mook.

2\. Today the Netherlands Government are inaugurating the Provisional Interim Federal Government, without Republicans. The Republican attitude is- (a) The Provisional Government cannot be regarded as an Interim Government preceding formation of Federal Government of the United States of Indonesia, since it only concerns territories outside the Republic.

(b) Today's proceedings stress the independent position of the Republic.

(c) Today's inauguration should in no way prejudice the Republic's position with regard to the proposed negotiations with the Netherlands Government for the formation of an Interim Government over the whole of Indonesia.
