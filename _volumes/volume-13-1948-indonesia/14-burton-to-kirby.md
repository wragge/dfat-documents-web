# 14 Burton to Kirby

Cablegram 15 CANBERRA, 12 January 1948, 2.15 p.m.

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Thanks your telegrams. At this stage, there is little advice which we can usefully give and would prefer to leave matter in your hands. It can quite probably be arranged for you to pay flying visit to New York, but desirable for you to return here first.
