Cablegram 340 CANBERRA, 31 December 1948, 8 p.m.

RESTRICTED SECRET

Your 323. [1]

Our understanding is Australia is not member of Consular Commission. In fact this is desirable as it leaves you free as member of Good Offices Committee to comment on Consuls' opinion.

There is no intention of sending Eaton back at present. If, however, you consider any good purpose can be served by being member Pritchett can represent on grounds we are members of Council when Indonesian matters are being discussed.
