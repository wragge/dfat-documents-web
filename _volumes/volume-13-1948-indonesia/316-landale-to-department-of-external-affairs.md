The following is a summary of the main points of a report in today's A.N.P. Bulletin which it is claimed emanates from 'competent sources'.

1\. Netherlands Government was yesterday drafting fresh recommendations for continued negotiations with the Republican Government without the mediation of the United Nations Good Offices Committee. These would be forwarded to Stikker's advisers who were in Batavia.

2\. Netherlands Government (it was understood) was compiling a memorandum couching in emphatic terms its attitude towards the present situation. This would be handed to the Republican Government shortly.

3\. The Dutch visualised that new negotiations would be extremely short.

4\. The present uncertain situation could not be tolerated 'much longer' owing to the agreement with non-Republican territories that the interim Government would be established before January 1st 1949.

5\. it was emphatically denied that any agreement had been reached in Djokjakarta between Stikker and Hatta. All talks had been exploratory.

6\. Dutch had continually stipulated as a primary condition for the resumption of discussions (a) immediate cessation of animate violations of the truce (b) resumption of goods traffic between the Republican and non-Republican areas.
