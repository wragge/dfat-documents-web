# 27 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K43 BATAVIA, 19 January 1948, 7.16 p.m.

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Truce developments require the immediate despatch of at least fourteen military observers (Brigadier Neylan's minimum estimate) including the return of Chesterman whose experience valuable. Each day's delay will work to the disadvantage of the Republic. Even this number would require the Committee to use observers of Consular Commission.

2\. Civilian personnel will also be required urgently as the Republic are most anxious that the Good Offices Committee should be represented on all committees, Republican and Netherlands, working on the political settlement.

3\. Kirby knows details.
