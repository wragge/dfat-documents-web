# 230 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 227 BATAVIA, 1 September 1948

SECRET

Your tele 228. [1]

There has been nothing further to report since my last telegram.

[2] The Minister should be informed however that the atmosphere here is as bad as or worse than at any other stage since the Committee arrived in Indonesia and that the only hope of a satisfactory solution lies in early and generous proposals by the Dutch for an overall settlement. These proposals should not only make an early transfer of complete sovereignty certain but should also provide for wide powers for Indonesians in the interim period.

2\. The Committee is leaving for Kaliurang today and there may be communication difficulties. I shall endeavour, however, to keep you and The Hague fully informed of any significant developments.

1 Dispatched on 30 August, it requested background information for Evatt's forthcoming discussions with Dutch authorities among whom was likely to be Van Mook.
