# 460 Forde to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram 347 OTTAWA, 24 December 1948, 2.25 p.m.

IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL

Your 318. [1] INDONESIA Following is derived from official sources but with statement that it can be accepted as authoritative expression of Canadian Government's viewpoint.

'Canadian Government is as disturbed as Australian Government at the possible effect on East Asia of the shooting in Indonesia.

Unfortunately only people who can gain by it are the communists.

We are supporting the "Cease Fire" portion of the resolution before the Security Council but feel that it would be most unwise to press things against the Dutch too far. In the past, sanctions have not been imposed by the Security Council on States such as the neighbours of Greece or against other Soviet satellites which have violated the charter. In the light of that very recent past we feel that it would not be appropriate to threaten sanctions against a state such as the Netherlands which, apart from this one episode, has been a faithful member of the United Nations. We were disturbed to read in the press that Australia might press for expulsion of the Netherlands; we hope that that story is not correct.'

Comment-Above statement was made before Australian approach to Security Council. Canadian attitude likely to be affected by the (1) Over-riding importance attached to North Atlantic Security pact.

(2) Possible impact on sections of Canadian public of any anti communist line which Dutch may adopt.

(3) Sentimental ties with Dutch arising from war.

1 Dispatched on an December at 3.55 p.m., it asked the High Commission in Ottawa to discuss with the Canadian Government Australian proposals for UN action to deal with the situation in Indonesia.
