# 312 Landale to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hague 275 THE HAGUE, 13 November 1948, 6 p.m.

RESTRICTED

Indonesia. Prime Minister Drees stated in Second Chamber that the Government intended to maintain its attitude as regards the establishment of an Interim Government on the 1st of January next.

It was not the intention of the Government to come to agreement with the Republic at any price and consequently if no agreement was reached before that time the Interim Government would be established without Republic co-operation.

2\. Drees also asserted that foreign circles did not appear to have a broad-minded view of the Indonesian issue. But the Government would bear in mind the international aspects of the problem.

3\. While Neher, who arrived here November 12th, is reported to have said that there 'seemed to be no reason for pessimism' regarding resumption of political negotiations, another report which it is claimed emanated from official sources, stresses that nothing is known here about an 'agreement in principle' between the Dutch and the Republicans to resume political negotiations.

4\. Conservative Trouw, has reported that friction has arisen between Stikker and the Minister for Overseas Territories, Sassen.
