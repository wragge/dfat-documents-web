# 31 Officer to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram Hague [1] 12 THE HAGUE, 22 January 1948, 5.35 p.m.

My telegram No. 11.

Following is statement. Begins:-

The Netherlands Government have accepted 6 points proposed by Committee Good Offices fully and unconditionally as a basis for political discussions for Republic.

It now appears Republic for its part, has attached one sided interpretation as a condition for its acceptance.

The Netherlands Government who have requested clarification, are of the opinion that they are entitled to expect Republic to accept 6 points without restriction -as they were proposed by Committee of Good Offices-before they can proceed with discussion on basis of these points.

Only in this manner is it possible to avoid that misunderstanding arise regarding obligation of both parties. Ends.
