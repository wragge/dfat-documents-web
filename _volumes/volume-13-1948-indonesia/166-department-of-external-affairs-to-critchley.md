# 166 Department of External Affairs to Critchley

## Cablegram 152 CANBERRA, 7 June 1948

IMMEDIATE

Our 149. [1]

ECAFE conference has not yet been able to decide question of admission of Indonesian Republic to associate membership. Attempt is being made to reach compromise under which Netherlands Delegation would sponsor separate associate memberships for Republic and remainder of Indonesia.

2\. In the meantime Netherlands Delegate has alleged that admission of Republic as associate member would seriously interfere with work of the Good Offices Committee. This argument seems fallacious and Committee should send message to conference chairman at Ootacamund disavowing any such effect on its work.

3\. Urgent action is desirable as conference is to consider matter again on Wednesday 9th June.
