# 141 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 61 THE HAGUE, 22 May 1948, 111.30 a.m.

SECRET

Your telegram 38. [1] Indonesia. Minister for Foreign Affairs is not available until Tuesday next when I arranged to see him.

2\. There is general dissatisfaction here at the slowness of negotiations for which the Republic is blamed. I understand that the United Kingdom Consul General at Batavia's reports support the view that negotiations are being delayed by Republican prevarication and that he has recommended pressure on them.

3\. You will appreciate that the steps proposed in the last paragraph of your telegram would arouse very deep resentment here and be regarded as a partisan measure contrary to our position as members of the Good Offices Commission. They would be liable to jeopardize the present good hope of full Dutch co-operation in Japanese treaty negotiations.
