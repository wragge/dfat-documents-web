# 329 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K196 BATAVIA, 26 November 1948

SECRET

My K. 195. [1]

Netherlands ECAFE delegation after consultations with Foreign Minister Stikker has advised that it cannot accept representation by the Republic which would distinguish it from other States of Indonesia. The Netherlands will therefore oppose attendance by Oesman as consultant or observer, but will seek to have the issue of Indonesian representation deferred.

_

1 Dispatched on 25 November, it advised the Department of External Affairs that the Netherlands Delegation to ECAFE had seemed receptive to the ideas contained in Cablegrams 312 and 313 (see Document 325).
