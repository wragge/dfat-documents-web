# 164 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram UN507 NEW YORK, 4 June 1948, 6.33 p.m.

SECRET

Indonesia.

Palar called today to inform us as follows (1) Republican authorities in Java think there is a real possibility of renewed Dutch 'Police Action' and have instructed him to try to obtain Security Council injunction that such action would be inadmissible during negotiations. (He apparently is not in possession of specific evidence that Dutch contemplate such action.) (2) He has had no reaction from Java on the proposal (see our UN742 [1]) for de jure United Nations' Sovereignty but has been instructed to endeavour to secure Security Council recognition of defacto Republican Sovereignty in territory at present under Republican control and Dutch Sovereignty in that under Dutch control.

(3) Indonesian representative in Prague (Suripno) when asking [2] exchange of representatives with Eastern European countries was acting on authority from previous Government (Sjarifoeddin) and not present Government. Palar had this from Prague not from Java.

He apparently feels reported Soviet agreement with Suripno to exchange representatives [3] will adversely affect Republic's position.
