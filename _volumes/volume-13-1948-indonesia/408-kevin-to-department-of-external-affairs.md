# 408 Kevin to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 496 NEW DELHI, 20 December 1948, 9.25 p.m.

My telegram 494. [1]

Speaking yesterday at the concluding session of the All India Congress Conference, Nehru referring to the situation in Indonesia warned the Dutch that they would not be able to achieve their object. No one, he said, could prevent the tide of independence in Asian countries. The Dutch action would have serious repercussions in India, in Asia and perhaps in some other countries. Though India could not give the Republic effective aid now she could not remain an idle spectator. India could not approve of the Dutch action.

India's foreign policy was that no foreign power should rule over any Asian country. The reaction to the Dutch action would soon be heard all over Asia and India would have to consider what she would do under the circumstances.
