# 357 Burton to Evatt

Draft Cablegram E105 CANBERRA, 8 December 1948

IMPORTANT SECRET

Further to my E104 the United States delegation has now switched and is supporting Dutch under threat that Dutch will leave conference. This is in my view green light to police action. It is now clear that United Kingdom and U.S.A. have been giving us assurances which are not justified. The Pacific and Australia are more and more becoming a by-product of European events.
