# 472 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K228 BATAVIA, [25 December] 1948, 6.40 p.m.

IMPORTANT RESTRICTED

We shall endeavour to report in terms of the Security Council's resolution in time for meeting on December 26th and show clearly Netherlands as aggressors.

2\. In practice it will be impossible to enforce effectively the cease-fire hostilities order without some arrangements for demarcation lines and withdrawal of Netherlands forces. Doubtless the Dutch will claim they now control all territories in Indonesia.

Please number my en clair telegram today K.227.
