# 284 Makin to Burton

Cablegram 1126 WASHINGTON, 20 October 1948

SECRET PERSONAL

INDONESIA

In discussing means of securing lifting of blockade, State Department official suggested informally that in view of Critchley's 'unpopularity' with the Dutch and recent friendly talks between the Minister and Stikker, an approach through The Hague, possibly by the Minister himself, might be more productive.

I do not know Critchley's standing in Batavia, nor the nature of the Minister's conversations, but assume you will take these factors into consideration.
