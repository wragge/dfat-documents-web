# 371 Critchley to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram K210 BATAVIA, 14 December 1948, 5 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL

High Republican officials in Batavia have reported the following background to Hatta's letter to Cochran (my telegram K.209).

According to Cochran (a) The Netherlands officially informed the United States and United Kingdom Ambassadors at The Hague that the Republic would not accept Netherlands sovereignty in the interim period as required by the Renville agreement.

(b) The United Kingdom advised the United States that if the Republic refuses to accept Netherlands sovereignty in the interim period, they would not support the Republic now or in future.
