# 440 Department of External Affairs to Hodgson

Cablegram P291 CANBERRA, 23 December 1948, 2.05 p.m.

IMMEDIATE RESTRICTED

First report Council meeting received. None of the speeches reported so far has any relevance to the resolution you were to sponsor with the United States, that is calling for immediate cease-fire. There is no need to discuss merits or past history.

The clear fact is there is fighting against the Security Council order, and we are now asking for an immediate cease-fire at which stage further measures can be considered.

Even though you arc last on the list to speak, it is suggested you immediately intervene and call for an immediate vote on the operative parts of the United States resolution without further debate or adjournment.
