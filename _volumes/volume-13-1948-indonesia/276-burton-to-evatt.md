# 276 Burton to Evatt

Cablegram E80 CANBERRA, 12 October 1948, 2.15 p.m.

SECRET PERSONAL

For your confidential information United States has decided not to support Dutch in Security Council if matter has to be referred back. They want to get relief into Indonesia and have sought our help. It seems best to encourage them to take the running at present at least until settlement looks possible and for them and not us to approach Dutch on blockade and related matters. Dutch have again asked for Kirby, but, in view of United States advices, Prime Minister thinks time not ripe as yet but will agree when there is a show of real intention to make agreement.
