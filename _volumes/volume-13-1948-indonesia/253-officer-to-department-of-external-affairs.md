# 253 Officer to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram Hag 129 THE HAGUE, 23 September 1948, 6.48 p.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET

INDONESIA

My telegram 127. [1]

Before the receipt of your telegram 92 I had seen the Secretary General this morning as Minister for Foreign Affairs was occupied with Parliamentary business and spoke much on the lines of your paragraph three.

2\. Mr Lovink assured me once again that the Netherlands Government would miss no opportunity of securing a settlement. But some parts of the United States proposals [2] they could not accept because they would have no hope of securing later necessary Parliamentary approval (by two thirds majority). They would have to work [with] [3] Good Offices Committee and try and secure a compromise. He hoped Hatta too, would be prepared to negotiate and not ask for more than proposals.

3\. He expressed grave concern at the situation in the Republic.

The possibilities were (a) that Hatta would overcome the Communists (b) that the Communists would overthrow Hatta (c) a compromise.

Personally he expected (c) and that Hatta will go more to the left and an agreement be more difficult than ever.

4\. Meanwhile indications were that the Communists will try to manipulate provocative Dutch intervention but if not would do their utmost to avoid any such step.

5\. I am advising Doctor Evatt of paragraphs two, three and four.
