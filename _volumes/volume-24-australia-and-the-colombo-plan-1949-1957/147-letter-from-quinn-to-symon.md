London, 8 February 1951

CONFIDENTIAL

With reference to the views on French and Dutch participation in the Colombo Plan which we have transmitted to you separately today,[^3] you will be aware that the Dutch have presented an _aide memoire_ to Australia as well as to the United Kingdom and other  Commonwealth countries regarding the contribution they could make.[^4]

While we realise that your reaction to this approach by the Dutch will doubtless be governed by the broader points of principle involved in French and Dutch participation, we should be glad of any comments you may feel able to make on the Dutch proposals.
