Colombo, 26 February 1951

103.

Thank you for your telegram 77.[^1] I shall be glad to fit in with your suggestion but would recommend against more than a brief visit to Karachi while Government's economic officials are pre-occupied with E.C.A.F.E. and its aftermath.[^2]

I therefore suggest the following itinerary.

(a) Depart Colombo for New Delhi March 2nd.

(b) Leave New Delhi approximately March 8th or 9th.

\(c\) Consult briefly with Said Hasan Secretary Department Economic Affairs at Lahore on the value of visit to Karachi.

(d) Return to Singapore via Karachi—length of stay in Pakistan being determined by advice of Said Hasan.[^3]

(e) Visit Indonesia by March 15th at the latest so as to be in a position to encourage participation in Colombo Plan at the time decision will be made.
