Colombo, 3 July 1951

223. RESTRICTED

Your 233.[^1]

Subject to certain reservations which need discussion and which are referred to in following cypher message our proposals at departmental level are as follows:— 

(1) that Australia mount an exhibit either separately or in contiguity with similar exhibits by other Colombo Plan participants. We do not favour a combined exhibit.

(2) the size would be something over 1000 square feet.

(3) technique would be used of displaying a small range of goods demonstrating Australia’s manufacturing capacity and general industrial potential, to enliven a pictorial demonstration of Australian contribution to the Colombo Plan. The purely commercial aspects would not be emphasised.

The exhibit generally would be modest but we would not want to risk Australian prestige by a dull exhibit and we think the only way of avoiding this is to include some actual goods of commercial interest.
