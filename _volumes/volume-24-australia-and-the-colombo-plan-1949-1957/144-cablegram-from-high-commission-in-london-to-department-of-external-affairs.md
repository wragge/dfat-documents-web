**Colombo Meeting of Commonwealth Consultative Committee**

Following is information obtained from Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, and Treasury Officials recently.

1. _Agenda_. So far Ceylon Government has not circulated a full agenda. Opinion here is that non-Commonwealth countries should receive this to. allow of adequate briefing. Americans are however aware from talks with United Kingdom from[^1] subjects to be discussed. United Kingdom proposed to suggest further item on scientific aspects of the plan and appointment of scientific Liaison Officer. Ceylon has been pressing for separate agenda item on finance, but United Kingdom do not envisage concrete discussions on this subject in meeting itself. They do however expect behind the scenes discussions between donor countries including Australia and New Zealand and individual recipient countries.

2. _Delegations_. Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations would like to know if Burton[^2] Is likely to lead the Australian Delegation in which case they would consider bringing in Hankinson.[^3]

3. _Non-Commonwealth countries other than United States_. Nothing has yet been heard from Burma and she is regarded as an unlikely starter although [she] will possibly be influenced by United States attitude. Siam is still stalling. Associated states have indicated keen interest and have stated definitely they will attend. They have not yet however put this in writing as requested by United Kingdom Ministry. Indonesia has not yet defined her position but it is known informally that Zain has been warned to stand by for Colombo.

4. _United States_. Donald Kennedy[^4] (who is No. 2 to McGhee) will attend for State Department. It is hoped there will also be a representative of the International Bank. It is felt here :

(a) That while there should be no impression of ganging up as such, the ground should be cleared as soon as possible before the meeting with a view to impressing the Americans with the singlemindedness of the Commonwealth on the Colombo Plan.

(b) That the Americans should not be allowed to go back without something concrete such as Committees recommendations to Governments.

United Kingdom officials envisage major business of meeting being brought forward on first day with view to impressing Americans and obtaining maximum publicity for announcements of what each country will do. Other matters such as non-Commonwealth countries and form of continuing organisation would then be dealt with.

5. _T.C.B_[^5] Canadians have requested extension of closing date for submission of nominations of Director to 31st January. Coomaraswamy[^6] is understood to have said that if no further applications are received by this date he will suggest at the meeting he is calling then that matter should be left over for C.C.C.[^7] Ceylon suggestion for combination of T.C.B. and continuing organisation is not favoured by officials here.
