London, 26 September 1950

4627\. RESTRICTED

The Consultative Committee today approved the August report of the Standing Committee on Technical Assistance which provides a constitution for an organisation which will be responsible for the provision of technical assistance under the Commonwealth scheme.

2\. The proposals contained in the report and the constitution are in accordance with the instructions sent to the Australian Representative on the Standing Committee after interdepartmental consultation.

3\. Since the report and constitution involve no new obligations beyond those accepted by Cabinet following Sydney Conference in May, I propose to accept the report on behalf of the Government.

4\. By separate telegram I will comment on matters upon which you asked my views in your 414 to New York.[1](#f1)
