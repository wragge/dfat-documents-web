Canberra, 8 June 1951

With reference to your note of fourth June[^1] inquiring as to the circulation of the United Kingdom Command Paper 8080[^2] on the Colombo Plan and of our booklet ‘New Hope for Asia’,[^3] it is advised:

1. _Command Paper_

Some three hundred or more copies of the Command Paper were distributed and about one hundred copies remain on hand, against future demand. Copies were distributed to Members and Senators when Mr. Spender tabled his report on the conference in the House.
In addition, the Minister’s office distributed quite a number of copies to individual inquirers and most of the remainder were sent out from the Department, to interested individuals and organisations. The demand for this document has, naturally, fallen off since our own booklet was published. I understand that the United Kingdom High Commissioner’s Office also distributed quite a number of copies of the Command Paper and of the United Kingdom ‘popular’ version.

2. _‘New Hope for Asia’_

A total of 20,000 copies of ‘New Hope for Asia’ was received by the Department for distribution, which 1s still in progress. About 8,500 copies remain to be sent out. Copies were mailed to all Members and Senators and will be sent to all new Members and Senators. Copies to meet requests were also sent to Parliament House. The distribution lists being used are very extensive, some having been supplied by the Commonwealth Office of Education and others by the ANIB. They cover newspapers and publications of many kinds, educational institutions, leaders in public and civic life, teachers, writers, clergy, legal men, business organisations, public servants, employers’ and employees’ associations, and many others. In addition to those being sent out to individual addressees, requests for from one copy to parcels of 100 or more are still coming in. They have been sent to overseas posts, and libraries, abroad and here, have been supplied, as have the State Parliaments and the Federal Sub-Treasuries in the capital cities.
