Canberra, 4 June 1951

With reference to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations telegram Circular E No. 8 of the 3rd May on the subject of the Colombo Plan Exhibition,[^1] I am directed by the High Commissioner to inform you that the High Commissioner for Ceylon in London[^2] discussed with Mr. Gordon Walker on 30th May last the proposed Exhibition.

2. Mr. Gordon Walker, who had suggested this interview, said that the United Kingdom Government had originally agreed to participate in the Exhibition on the assumption that it would be concerned specifically with the progress made and the results to be expected from the Colombo Plan. It now appeared that the Ceylon Government contemplated something rather wider, in other words an Exhibition covering all aspects of life in Ceylon, together with a pageant, trade fair and amusements. Naturally the United Kingdom Government had no wish to suggest that this wider Exhibition should not be held. On the other hand the effect it might have on the Colombo Plan had caused them some concern. There had already been criticism of too much talk and too little action. An Exhibition to focus attention on the Plan might do good, but an extravaganza not specifically connected with it might only do harm; furthermore, the inclusion of a trade fair, amusements, etc. might well forfeit sympathy in donor countries. In any case the United Kingdom Government could not themselves mount an Exhibit on this wider scale in the time available and they doubted whether the other participants, apart from Ceylon, could do so either. Mr. Gordon Walker suggested to the High Commissioner that an early meeting of the Special Liaison Committee might be held in Colombo in order to give the Ceylon Government an opportunity of clarifying the position and removing misunderstandings.

3. The High Commissioner agreed that this was desirable and said that he would immediately communicate with his Government to this effect.

4. In acquainting you of the above conversation I am to express the hope that when the next meeting of the Special Liaison Committee is called, the Australian representative will be in a position to express the Australian Government’s considered attitude in this matter. The United Kingdom representative will be briefed to say that, in the opinion of the United Kingdom Government, the wider type of Exhibition would be misleading and damaging to the Plan if called a Colombo Plan Exhibition. If Ceylon is determined to go ahead with her ambitious project (and the United Kingdom would not, of course, attempt to dissuade her) they feel that the Exhibition should have another title. The question would then arise whether there should be in the wider Exhibition a combined pavilion or exhibit devoted to the Colombo Plan. If India, Pakistan and Ceylon thought such an exhibit desirable, the United Kingdom Government would indicate their willingness to participate.

5. I am sending two copies of this letter to the Secretary, Department of External Affairs.
