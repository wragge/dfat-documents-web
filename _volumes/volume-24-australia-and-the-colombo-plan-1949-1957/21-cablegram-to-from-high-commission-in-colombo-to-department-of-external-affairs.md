Colombo, 15 January 1950

Friday morning's Conference session was substantially a review of the European situation.

[ _matter omitted_ ]

6\. The afternoon session considered and slightly amended the Australian/Ceylon/New Zealand resolution[1](#f1) embodying our economic proposals for South East Asia (our 35).[2](#f2) Pearson suggested the omission of any reference to Commonwealth support for high priority for South East Asian projects submitted to the International Bank, but after contrary view was expressed by Noel Baker, was retained.

7\. Final communique was drafted and considered by officials last night and finally adopted by conference yesterday morning (see our 35.) Conference concluded with open session. All delegations' leaders made closing speeches expressing satisfaction on the work done and appreciation of the hospitality of the Ceylon Government. (Special tribute was paid to the Conference Secretariat which has been notable for its efficiency and for the work of planning of Conference arrangements.)
