23. SECRET PRIORITY


**Colombo Plan: Next Meeting of Consultative Committee**

In view of the important part that science and technology have to play in the Colombo Plan, we have been considering possible means of using them to best advantage and would like to suggest that this subject should be added to the agenda of the Consultative Committee’s meeting next month.

2. On the assumption that this will prove acceptable we thought it might be useful if we circulated to governments our preliminary views to provide a basis for discussion.

_The manpower problem_

3. It is clear that when the Colombo Plan and extended United Nations Technical Assistance Programme get into their stride, increased demands will be made on the limited resources of scientific manpower. Governments might like to know that in anticipation of this situation, the United Kingdom Government is for its part conducting a comprehensive review of the whole position with the object of establishing effective machinery to meet the many demands which will be made on its resources.

_Co-ordination of knowledge and experience_

4. There would seem to be very great advantage in securing the closest possible degree ol co-ordination between the Scientific and Technological work that is proceeding in all participant countries. We feel that in this respect the knowledge and experience of each should be made freely available: to all and we would propose for consideration of governments the following practical steps to achieve this object.

_Appointment of Scientific Liaison Officer_

5. As a first step we would suggest that a Scientific Liaison Officer of high standing be appointed to the staff . of the Bureau for Technical Co-operation possibly under the title ‘Scientific Adviser to the Director’. This Officer would be able to establish close relations with the leading scientists of participating countries, could hope to identify those scientific questions which call for co-operative study, he would be able to assist in drafting scientific and technological sections of annual progress report (if the idea of this report comments itself to governments), and he would seek to arrange for the appropriate scientific knowledge and experience to be brought to bear on matters requiring it. This could be done either by _ad hoc_ study groups to review particular problems or by direct consultation with the suitable scientific authorities.

_Conference of scientific authorities_

6. Furthermore we think it would be useful if an ad hoc conference of leading scientific authorities in participating countries were arranged for this summer. Such a conference which ‘should it is suggested be at highest level might have as its object a study of the scientific and technological implications of the plan.

7. We propose to pass a copy of this message to the United States authorities and to other non-Commonwealth Governments invited to attend the meeting of the Consultative Committee in Colombo.
