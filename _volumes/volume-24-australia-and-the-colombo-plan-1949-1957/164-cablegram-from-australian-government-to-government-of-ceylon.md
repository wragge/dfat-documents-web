Canberra, 12 April 1951

The Australian Government wish to thank you for the invitation to participate in the proposed Colombo Plan Exhibition.[^1] This matter is receiving full and sympathetic consideration but in view of the dissolution of the Australian Parliament it will not be possible to make a final decision for several weeks.[^2] In the meantime it would be appreciated if further details could be supplied through our High Commissioner’s Office.
Please pass copy to our High Commissioner’s Office.
