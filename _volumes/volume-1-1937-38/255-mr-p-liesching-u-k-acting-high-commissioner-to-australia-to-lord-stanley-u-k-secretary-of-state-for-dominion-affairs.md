Cablegram unnumbered 15 September 1938,

IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET

Your most secret telegram of to-day. [1] Prime Minister [2] asks me to convey the following message very urgently to Mr Chamberlain. [3] Begins.

As our cables supplemented by Bruce [4] and the Acting High Commissioner [5] have from time to time informed you our attitude has been one of support for your policy and actions on behalf of peace. Your latest projected personal course excites our warmest admiration and will in our opinion completely consolidate British opinion over the whole world. Ends.

Above message was drafted in the presence of Page [6] Menzies [7] and myself They regarded the action as inspired and it would be difficult to exaggerate the warmth of the enthusiasm with which they learnt of Mr Chamberlain's proposed action. End of telegram.
