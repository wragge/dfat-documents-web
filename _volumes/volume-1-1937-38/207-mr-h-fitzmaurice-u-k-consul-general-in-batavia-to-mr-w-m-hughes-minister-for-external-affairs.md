# 207 Mr H. Fitzmaurice, U.K. Consul-General in Batavia, to Mr W. M. Hughes, Minister for External Affairs

## Letter BATAVIA, 29 April 1938

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th April [1], in which you were good enough to inform me that His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has decided against the establishment of an air connection with Dilli.

2\. In regard to your request for information as to further developments in this matter, I have the honour to inform you that the Manager of K.N.I.L.M. informed me in conversation a week or two ago that the Government of Portuguese Timor has lately been showing interest in the possibility of the establishment of air connection with the Netherlands East Indies by a service of K.N.I.L.M. and the matter was now receiving consideration. I said that this sounded very satisfactory, and that I hoped such a line might materialise.

H. FITZMAURICE
