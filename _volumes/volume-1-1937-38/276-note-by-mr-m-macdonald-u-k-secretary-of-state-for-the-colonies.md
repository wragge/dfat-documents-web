# 276 Note by Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Secretary of State for the Colonies

LONDON, 25 September 1938

MOST SECRET

Mr Bruce [1] rang me up during lunch today, between the two Cabinet meetings, to say that on further careful thought about the German memorandum [2] which the Prime Minister [3] had forwarded to Prague he was still more inclined to accept the scheme.

I went round to see him after the afternoon Cabinet, when he supported this attitude with a good deal of argument. [4]

M. M[ACDONALD]
