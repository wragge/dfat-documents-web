# 240 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram 121 LONDON, 18 August 1938

PERSONAL AND SECRET FOR HIMSELF

With reference to our telephone conversation re League of Nations.

[1] In view of agreement reached at Imperial Conference last year as to Empire policy (see page 9 of Minutes of 13th Meeting of principal delegates [2]) it seems to me it would create a very difficult position if we now took up an attitude in opposition to the contemplated United Kingdom declaration which is broadly in line with the decisions above referred to.

I would suggest therefore that we should support United Kingdom declaration but this would not preclude our making it understood that our attitude is governed by the fact that it has now been made clear that the member nations of the League are not prepared to accept automatic obligations with regard to sanctions of any kind.

BRUCE
