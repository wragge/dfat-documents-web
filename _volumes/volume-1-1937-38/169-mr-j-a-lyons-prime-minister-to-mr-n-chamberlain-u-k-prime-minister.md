Cablegram unnumbered 26 March 1938,

PERSONAL

I desire to thank you for the text of your speech in the House of Commons. [1]

We welcome the determination of the United Kingdom Government to accelerate its rearmament programme. We are prepared to co-operate with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in its efforts to push ahead with its defence plans necessary for the peace and integrity of the Empire. By such means we feel sure that the peace of the world will eventually be secured.

LYONS
