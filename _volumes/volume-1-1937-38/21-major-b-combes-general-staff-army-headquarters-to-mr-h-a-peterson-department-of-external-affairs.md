# 21 Major B. Combes, General Staff, Army Headquarters, to Mr H. A. Peterson, Department of External Affairs

Letter MELBOURNE, 29 April 1937

SECRET AND PERSONAL

A few weeks ago, I received through the Department of Commerce a communication from Colonel Longfield Lloyd, Tokyo. [1] Lloyd, as you are probably aware, was a Military Intelligence officer before going to his post in Tokyo.

The communication has the following preface-

'It is particularly asked that the attachments hereto be brought to the notice of Major B. Combes, General Staff, Army Headquarters, Melbourne.

It is expressly asked also that it be urged in the same quarter that there is increasing necessity for the most positive supervision over Northern and North-Western Australian waters, with emphasis on Darwin, regarding which area there are signs of much increased interest in Japanese official circles. A similar precaution is indicated in respect of New Guinea waters.

This is strongly emphasized; and there are potentialities relating to Yampi and surrounding area to which unremitting examination would be advisably directed.'

The attachments deal with various matters concerning the economic position in Japan and are, in fact, duplicates of reports to the Secretary, Department of Commerce.

I do not know whether you have heard anything of this 'warning'. I think you should know about it. Hence this personal note. Should you so desire, I could get it sent to you officially through the usual channels.

B. COMBES
