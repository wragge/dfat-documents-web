Cablegram unnumbered BATAVIA, 7 December 1938

CONFIDENTIAL

A representative of Asiatic Investment Company named Buchan has just been to see me in regard to Timor oil position before leaving for Sydney by air today.

He professes to desire to negotiate with the Australian Government with a view to his Company co-operating. I advised him to make a frank explanation of the position. He was clearly anxious for information of progress made by Oil Search, but I merely said I had no recent information.
