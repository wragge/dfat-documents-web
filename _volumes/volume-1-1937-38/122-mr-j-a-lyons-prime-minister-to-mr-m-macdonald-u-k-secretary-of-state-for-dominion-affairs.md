# 122 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 8 2 February 1938,

SECRET

My colleagues and I have read with great interest your telegram of 27th January, 1938 [1], with regard to international affairs. We agree that the present situation calls for action and we feel that the re-opening of conversations with Italy is of the utmost importance. I should be glad if you would continue to keep me fully advised as to the situation.
