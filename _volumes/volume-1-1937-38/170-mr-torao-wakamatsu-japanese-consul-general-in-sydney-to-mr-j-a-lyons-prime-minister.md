# 170 Mr Torao Wakamatsu, Japanese Consul-General in Sydney, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

## Letter SYDNEY, 26 March 1938

URGENT

I have the honour to bring to your notice an article appearing in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of March 24th [1], a cutting of which is enclosed herewith, with reference to the probability of a proclamation being issued by the Federal Government within the next few days prohibiting the export of iron ore from Australia.

I shall be grateful if you will be good enough to inform me of both the tentative and the final decisions by the Federal Government as regards this matter, because I am greatly concerned about its development, in view of large Japanese interests such as those which, as you are aware, have been vested in Yampi Sound, Western Australia.

TORAO WAKAMATSU Consul-General
