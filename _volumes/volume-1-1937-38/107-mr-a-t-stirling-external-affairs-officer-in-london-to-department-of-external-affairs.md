# 107 Mr A. T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 138 LONDON, 18 November 1937, 6.41 p.m.

An indication has been received from the Japanese Ambassador in London [1] to the effect that his Government is disposed to accept an offer of good offices by the United States and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Government is prepared at this stage to consider making such an offer on the following conditions:-

(a) that the United States would join in the offer;

(b) that there was a reasonable chance of the Japanese Government ultimately accepting;

(c) that the Chinese Government would accept.

It is felt at present that it would probably be best for the acceptance of the various parties to be secured before the Brussels Conference meets again on November 22nd. It is tentatively thought that the Conference (whose chances of success are now almost negligible) might then take note of the fact of acceptance and suspend action. His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Washington' has been requested by telegram to obtain the view of the United States Government.
