# 221 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr Torao Wakamatsu, Japanese Consul-General in Sydney

## Letter 24 June 1938,

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your further letter of 23rd June, 1938 [1], on the subject of the export of iron ore from Australia, and to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of the Statement which I made in this regard in the House of Representatives on 19th May. [2] You will see that I said that if the detailed survey of Australia's iron ore resources which is now being undertaken results in the appearance of some reassuring features, the Government would be prepared to reconsider the decision which has been reached.

In view of the fact that the survey will involve a great amount of detailed work, as considerable distances will need to be covered, and as it will be necessary to collaborate with State Governments, it is not possible to form any estimate of the time which will be occupied by the investigation. It will, however, be conducted with the greatest possible expedition.

J. A. LYONS
