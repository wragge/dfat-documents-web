# 229 Mr E. E. Longfield Lloyd, Australian Government Commissioner in Japan, to Prime Minister's Department

## Cablegram unnumbered TOKYO, 11 July 1938, 3.24 P.m.

Foreign Office further remarks regarding iron ore merely altered earlier request for interim supplies to hope for export about 1940.

Much less pressing than before, and I simply referred to the Prime Minister's [1] latest statement. [2] Recent trade and shipping arrangements [3] have eased the ore matter which I assume now closed.
