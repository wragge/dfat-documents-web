# 85 Mr A. T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 127 LONDON, 22 October 1937

H.B.M's Ambassador in Tokyo [1] is of the opinion that the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs [2] put up a struggle for representation at the Nine Power Conference at Brussels. The latest information from Japan indicates however that the War Ministry and the General Staff are unanimously opposed to taking part in the Conference. There is still a possibility that mediation at some future date by a third power, preferably Great Britain, may be arranged. It is felt here that the time during which the Brussels Conference will sit, depends on whether or not Japan is represented. It is thought that the Conference may last for some time, or alternatively for only a brief period. Again, it may go on for some time, with intervals either while replies to communications to Tokyo were being awaited or while negotiations were pending. These negotiations, it is thought, may be entrusted to one or more of the Governments represented at the Nine Power Conference.
