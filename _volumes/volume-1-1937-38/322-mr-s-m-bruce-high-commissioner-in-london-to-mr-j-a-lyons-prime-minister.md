# 322 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 2 December 1938, 5.14 p.m.

Refugees. Minister's statement [1] received widespread publicity London and provincial press. 'Times' leading article: 'Australia has made characteristically generous contribution to solution of refugee problem. Conditions on which they are to be admitted show that Government have forestalled objections of Australians who fear refugee immigration may promote formation unassimilable foreign communities or lower high standard living. Commonwealth Government have certainly done full share in admitting these 15,000 immigrants. It is hoped other countries within British Commonwealth and outside will follow their example!
