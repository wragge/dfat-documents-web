Cablegram 40 14 April 1938,

Reference your Circular telegrams Nos. 83 [1] and 84 [2] of 26th and 30th March, 1938, respectively, and your telegram No. 43 of 6th April, 1938. [3]

His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia desires that the German Government be informed through the diplomatic channel that the Commonwealth Government has given consideration to the terms of the Notes addressed by the United Kingdom Government to the German Government on 2nd April, 1938, and that, in taking note of the United Kingdom Government's decision to withdraw His Majesty's Legation from Vienna and to replace it by a Consulate-General, the Commonwealth Government desires to reserve its position in regard to treaties and other matters which will arise in consequence of the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich.
