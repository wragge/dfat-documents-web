# 106 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 16 November 1937, 5.58 p.m.

PERSONAL

Your telegram of 15th November [1]: I have made it clear at Brussels that, while authorised to co-operate to the maximum extent in the work of the Conference, I could not agree to any commitment until I had consulted my Government. The draft declaration discussed at the meeting last Saturday [2] and approved at the meeting on Monday [3] when subsequently issued to the Press, contained no commitment other than the undertaking to consider the common attitude embodied in the last paragraph.

Taking this view I did not ask for your authority of approval but my telegram on Saturday last embodied the full text of the last paragraph in case you desired to make any observations before the draft declaration was approved on Monday. You can rest assured that before I assent to any course involving action you will be consulted.

BRUCE
