# 247 Mr N. Chamberlain, U.K. Prime Minister, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram 84 LONDON, 3 September 1938, 10.04 p.m.

SECRET

Most grateful for the views of His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia as stated in your telegram No. 84. [1] We much appreciate the expression of strong support of our policy as declared in my speech of 24th March and reaffirmed in Sir John Simons [2] speech of 27th August. We are giving the most careful consideration to the Commonwealth Government's views in the light of the situation as it develops.

On the particular question of the publication of the present Czech proposals you will have seen the latest position from the Secretary of State's telegram Circular B. 207. [3]

3 Circular cablegram B207 from the Dominions Secretary, dated and received 2 September 1938, not printed, said that Lord Runciman believed that publication of Dr Benes's proposals (see Document 244, note 2) would have 'an evil effect' and the United Kingdom Government had accepted his decision. Lord Runciman was pressing Benes to go 'to the utmost limits' to meet Sudeten demands, and had sent two messages to Hitler through the Sudeten Party leader, Konrad Henlein (see Document 248).
