# 287 Mr F. K. Officer, Australian Counsellor at British Embassy in Washington, to Department of External Affairs

## Cablegram 59 WASHINGTON, 28 September 1938

Press have doubtless reported fully that President Roosevelt last night followed up his general appeal of last week by a message to Hitler alone urging continuance of negotiations to end crisis and that use of force would be unjustified and unnecessary.

Position here is that whilst ten days ago there was at least as much criticism of the United Kingdom Government's action as support for it there is now a very general attitude of praise for Mr Chamberlain's efforts and an increasing criticism of what is generally described as the reckless attitude of Germany.

But although we now have public opinion and sympathy there is every sign that this country is determined not to become embroiled.
