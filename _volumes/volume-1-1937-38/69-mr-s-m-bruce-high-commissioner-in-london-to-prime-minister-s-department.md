# 69 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Prime Minister's Department

Cablegram unnumbered GENEVA, 29 September 1937, 10.52 p.m.

SECRET

Further meeting of the Advisory Committee held this evening.

Representative of Ecuador proposed immediate declaration of Japan as aggressor but did not persist in the face of the proposal by France supported by the United Kingdom that Sub-committee be appointed to deal with China's appeal. Meeting adjourned until tomorrow when the Sub-committee will probably be appointed and the terms of reference to the Sub-committee approved. Present indications are that Australia will be invited to join the Sub- committee and unavoidably accept.
