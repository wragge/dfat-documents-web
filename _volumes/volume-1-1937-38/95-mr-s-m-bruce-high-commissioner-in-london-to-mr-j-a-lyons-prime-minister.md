# 95 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON [1], 4 November 1937, 7.50 p.m.

MOST SECRET PRIVATE

Session of Conference [2] held this afternoon. It is now almost certain that small committee will be appointed to study the Japanese reply to the Belgian invitation and to try to establish contact with Japan and China with a view to the possibility of offering good offices. The appointment of the Committee is held up at present owing to difficulty of agreement regarding the number of members-three or five.

BRUCE

_

1 The cablegram is headed 'From the High Commissioner, London', but it appears from the text that it was actually sent from Brussels. Bruce attended meetings on 4, 5 and 6 November; there were adjournments 6 to 9 November, 10 to 12 November, 14 to 21 November. Bruce probably returned to London for the first two adjournments, and definitely did so for the last one.
