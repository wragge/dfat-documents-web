# 78 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, n.d.

SECRET

Have received copy of invitation despatched to you by the President of the Assembly of the League of Nations inviting Australia as a signatory of the Washington Treaty to confer with the other League members parties to the Treaty with a view to a meeting of the Washington Powers in accordance with the resolution of the Assembly. [2] The invitation only requires an acknowledgement which I will deal with. The British Government has in contemplation that the Dominions will be invited to attend the conference of Washington Powers when held. Have no information as to the attitude of the other Dominions, but in my view Australia should accept. Will advise you further when position more developed.

BRUCE
