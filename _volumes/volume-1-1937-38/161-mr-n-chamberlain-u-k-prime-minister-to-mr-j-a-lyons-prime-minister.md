I am much obliged for your telegram of March 23rd in regard to Czechoslovakia [2] I am glad to think that our two Governments are in such close accord as to the policy to be pursued.

2 This presumably refers to Lyons's cable of 21 March 1938 (Document 148), which may not have been received in London until 23 March.
