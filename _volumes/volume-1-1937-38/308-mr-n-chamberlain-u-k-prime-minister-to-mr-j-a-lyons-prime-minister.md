# 308 Mr N. Chamberlain, U.K. Prime Minister, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram log LONDON, 27 October 1938, 6.46 p.m.

SECRET

Your telegram 26th October No. 106. [1]

Following for Prime Minister from my Prime Minister. [2]

I am very grateful for your message. You will have seen from telegram Circular B.396 of October 26th [3] that the United Kingdom Government are entirely in accord with the views of the Commonwealth Government and that we have decided to take immediate steps with a view to bringing the Agreement into force. The question will be brought before Parliament when it reassembles. It would be very helpful to me to be able to quote the substance of your message in the House of Commons and I should much appreciate it if you could see your way to agreeing to my doing so.
