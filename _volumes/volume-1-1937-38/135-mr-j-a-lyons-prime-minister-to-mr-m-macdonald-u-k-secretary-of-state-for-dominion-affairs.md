# 135 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

## Cablegram 25 12 March 1938,

I have received your telegram of 10th March [1] regarding the United Kingdom Press Conference.

So far as Australian publicity is concerned I propose to see the newspaper proprietors and the Australian Broadcasting Commission with a view to action being taken along similar lines.
