# 104 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered LONDON [1], 13 November 1937, 9.15 p.m.

Today's meeting generally followed the lines indicated in yesterday's cablegram. [2] The draft press communique prepared and presented jointly by the United Kingdom, United States and France down the lines indicated, and concluding as follows:-

'Whilst hoping that Japan will not maintain her refusal the Governments represented at Brussels must consider what is to be their common attitude in a situation where one party to an international treaty maintains against the views of all the other parties that the action which it has taken does not come within the scope of that treaty and sets aside the provisions of the treaty which the other parties hold to be operative in the circumstances,'

met with general approval, including all the Dominions. Italy raised objections and will probably dissent. The Scandinavian countries' assent may include slight reservations but the United Kingdom and the United States attempting to obviate them.

Adjournment to allow reference to the Governments till Monday [3] when decision will be taken. After the Monday meeting probable adjournment for a week for consideration and consultation between the Governments. Future attitude will be mainly governed by the United States position, and particularly by the President's message to Congress on reassembling Monday next.
