Cablegram unnumbered 18 October 1937,

Commonwealth Government has accepted invitation from Belgian Government to be represented at Conference of Signatory Powers of Nine Power Treaty at Brussels on 30th October.

Prime Minister [1] has announced to Press that invitation has been accepted and that you will be Australian representative. As the Nine Power Treaty is in Heads of States form, it seems that Executive Council should move His Majesty to issue full powers to you.

I should like your opinion as to whether this is necessary. If unnecessary advise procedure to be adopted for formal notification of your appointment. [2]
