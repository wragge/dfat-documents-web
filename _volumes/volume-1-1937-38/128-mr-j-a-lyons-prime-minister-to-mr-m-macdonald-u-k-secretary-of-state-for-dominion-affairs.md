# 128 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

## Cablegram 20 6 March 1938,

In connection with the resignation of Mr Eden [1] there has been some confusion and misconception in the minds of the Australian public as to whether there had been in fact a reversal of British foreign policy and withdrawal of support for the principles of the League of Nations.

Certain criticisms have appeared with regard to consultation with the Dominions. These as you will appreciate have no substance and of course are not in accordance with fact.

During the last three days my Government has fully considered all aspects of the question [2] and I propose to make the statement contained in my immediately following telegram. [3]
