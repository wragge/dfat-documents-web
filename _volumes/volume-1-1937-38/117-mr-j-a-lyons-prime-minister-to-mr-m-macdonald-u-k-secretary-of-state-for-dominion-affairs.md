# 117 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Draft Cablegram [111] [1] n.d. [30 December 1937]

His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is of the opinion that His Excellency the Govem6r-General [2] on his approaching visit to England leaving Australia in March might with great advantage pay an official visit to the Governor-General of the Netherlands Indies. Such a visit would in our opinion be a gesture of goodwill and do much' to, cement the Present cordial relations between the British Commonwealth and the Netherlands.

[3] His Excellency heartily agrees with the proposal and is anxious to further the objective mentioned.

An informal approach to this end has been made to the Governor- General of the Netherlands Indies through the Consul-General in Australia [4], and an intimation has been received in the form of an invitation that the proposed visit would be cordially welcomed.

In these circumstances, His Excellency the Governor-General would be pleased if you would arrange for his acceptance of this kind invitation to be conveyed to the Netherlands Government through the appropriate channel.

3 The suggestion for a goodwill visit was made by R. G. Menzies to Cabinet some time before 10 December 1937. See Menzies's letter to Lyons, 23 December 1937 and Elink Schuurman's letter to W. M.

Hughes, 23 December 1937 (both on file AA : A981, NEI 52).
