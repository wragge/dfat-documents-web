# 325 Canadian Department of External Affairs to Commonwealth Government

## Cablegram 14 OTTAWA, 5 December 1938, 12.33 p.m.

I understand that the Commonwealth Government has indicated recognition of the Italian sovereignty of Ethiopia. I should be much obliged to receive details of action taken.
