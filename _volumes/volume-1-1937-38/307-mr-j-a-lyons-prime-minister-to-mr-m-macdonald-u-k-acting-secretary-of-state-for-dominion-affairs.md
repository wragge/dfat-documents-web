# 307 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr M. MacDonald, U.K. Acting Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

Cablegram 106 26 October 1938,

SECRET

Commonwealth Government strongly of opinion that, as a contribution to peace, Anglo-Italian agreement should be brought into operation forthwith and de jure recognition accorded to Italian Empire in Abyssinia. Italian withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Spain seems a real contribution and in present condition of world, a peaceful and friendly Mediterranean is in our opinion essential. To refuse de jure recognition seems to us to ignore the facts and to risk danger for a matter which is now immaterial. [1]
