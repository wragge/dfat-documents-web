In connection with the question of the provision of reserves for Singapore, the Minister for External Affairs; has forwarded to me a letter in which he makes certain suggestions regarding the security of Australia as affected by British Naval co-operation.

I should be glad if you would be good enough to let me have your comments on the suggestion that the United Kingdom Government be pressed for further information in this matter.
