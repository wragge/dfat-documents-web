# 96 Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London, to Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister

Cablegram unnumbered BRUSSELS, 5 November 1937, 4.40 p.m.

MOST SECRET

As indicated in yesterday's (Thursday) telegram [1], no agreement on the number of the Committee was reached last night. Private session of the Conference held to-day commenced with President Spaak [2] reading a draft reply to the Japanese note of refusal, and supplementary official statement accompanying it, which he had prepared over night. General discussion followed when the delegates indicated various amendments. President will prepare fresh draft for submission to the Conference to-morrow Saturday morning. Final text will probably contain statement that the Conference is prepared to invite a small number of members without specifying them to confer with the Japanese Government.
