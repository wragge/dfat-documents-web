Cablegram unnumbered 23 March 1938,

PERSONAL

My colleagues and I have given careful consideration to matter of attitude to be adopted with regard to possibilities arising out of relations of Germany with Czechoslovakia. [1] We recognise fully the difficulties which surround this question and we realise that your Government will not come to a decision without exploring every possible eventuality. We feel that no definite commitment with regard to Czechoslovakia should be undertaken. I send you this as it may be of value to have our views during your deliberations.

LYONS
