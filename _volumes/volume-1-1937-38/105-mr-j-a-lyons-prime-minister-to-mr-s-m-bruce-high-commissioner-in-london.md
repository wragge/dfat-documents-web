# 105 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr S. M. Bruce, High Commissioner in London

## Cablegram unnumbered 15 November 1937,

Your telegrams of 12th and 13th November [1]: The Commonwealth Government adopted the draft declaration but points out that it had no opportunity to make any suggestions thereon before publication.

Whilst admitting this was in the circumstances unavoidable, the Government asks that before any action is taken on or arising out of the declaration the Government will have full opportunity of giving its views on such proposed action. [2]
