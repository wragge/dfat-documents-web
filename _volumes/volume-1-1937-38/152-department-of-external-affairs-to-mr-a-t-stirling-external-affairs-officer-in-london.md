# 152 Department of External Affairs to Mr A. T. Stirling, External Affairs Officer in London

## Cablegram 13 24 March 1938,

Please see Dominions Office Circular telegram No. 73 of 22nd March. [1] Obligation No. 2 in regard to Czechoslovakia is in conflict with our previous notions and advice to our Government.

Repeated statements of British commitments have not mentioned this-e.g. Leamington. [2] They refer to British interest, only in Central Europe and not to commitments. We would like to know precisely what is the obligation referred to and in what circumstances it would operate.
