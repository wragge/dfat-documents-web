# 188 Mr J. A. Lyons, Prime Minister, to Mr N. Chamberlain, U.K. Prime Minister

## Cablegram unnumbered 19 April 1938,

On 18 April 1938 the U.K. Ambassador in Rome, Lord Perth, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, signed the Anglo-Italian Agreement, which was intended to reduce tension between the two countries by ending hostile propaganda, by exchanging military information annually, and by delineating more clearly their spheres of interest in East and North Africa and the Middle East.

For the full text see U.K. Command Paper 5726.

Desire to tender to you congratulations of my colleagues and myself on the successful and happy outcome of the negotiations with the Government of Italy.

Glad if you would also convey in similar terms to Lord Perth our appreciation of his work.

LYONS
