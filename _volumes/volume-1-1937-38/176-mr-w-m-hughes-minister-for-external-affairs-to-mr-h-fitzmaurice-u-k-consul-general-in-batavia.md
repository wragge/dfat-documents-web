# 176 Mr W. M. Hughes, Minister for External Affairs, to Mr H. Fitzmaurice, U.K. Consul-General in Batavia

## Letter 5 April 1938,

With reference to your air mail despatch of the 5th January, 1938 [1], concerning air communications with Portuguese Timor, I have the honour to inform you that after giving full consideration to the question raised in the seventh paragraph of your despatch, His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has decided that it would be impracticable to establish or support an air connection with Dilli.

His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has nevertheless found the information contained in your despatch to be of great interest, and, while regretting its inability to take any active steps in the matter of air services, it would be pleased to receive information as to further developments.

W. M. HUGHES
