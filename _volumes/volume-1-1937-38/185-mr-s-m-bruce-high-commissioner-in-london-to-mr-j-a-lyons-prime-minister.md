Cablegram unnumbered LONDON, 11 April 1938, 5.52 p.m.

PERSONAL MOST SECRET

Your telegram April 7th Yampi Sound. [1]

I am in touch with the British Government and the matter is being examined by the Board of Trade and Foreign Office. I am pressing for early advice but I am afraid it may not be possible to inform you of the outcome of discussions by April 13 th as desired. Will advise you however as soon as possible thereafter.

BRUCE
