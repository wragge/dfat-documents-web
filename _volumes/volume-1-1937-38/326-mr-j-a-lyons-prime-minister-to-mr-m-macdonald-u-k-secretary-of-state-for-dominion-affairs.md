Cablegram unnumbered6 December 1938,

CLEAR THE LINE

Reported here that Prime Minister [1] in House of Commons Stated:(begins) It was for each member of the British Commonwealth to decide the extent to which it would participate in any war in which another member was engaged but I am sure I am right in interpreting the wishes of the people of Britain when I say that if any part of the Empire is attacked we will go to its aid without hesitation (ends).

Glad of immediate advice as to whether Prime Minister used these words. Glad also to receive any amplifying statement which would be useful to me here in compiling comments which I have been asked to make.
