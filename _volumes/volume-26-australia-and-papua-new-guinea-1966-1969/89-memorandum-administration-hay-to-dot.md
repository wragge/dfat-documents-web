# 89 Memorandum, Administration (Hay) To Dot

Port Moresby, 4 February 1967

**Under-Secretaries in the House of Assembly**

I refer to your 64/3516 of the 24th January, 1967. 1

I have now had reports from all Departments with Under-Secretaries. Each Department has reviewed the effectiveness of the work of each Under-Secretary. All Departments have worked hard to make a success of the Under-Secretary system and with a few exceptions Under-Secretaries have done their best to play an active part in departmental affairs. I think that the Under-Secretary system is working as well as possible within the limitations imposed by some of the problems encountered by the individuals concerned.

Originally it was assumed that Under-Secretaries would take up residence in Port Moresby and would thus be able to devote most of their time to duties with their Departments. It was expected that they would pay fairly frequent visits to their electorates to keep in touch with home affairs. However, Under-Secretaries soon found that their electors expected to see and hear from their Member a good deal more than occasional visits permitted and that it was necessary for Members to spend most of their time travelling through the electorates if they were to retain the confidence and support of the people. Allied with this requirement was the feeling of inadequacy and frustration some Under-Secretaries felt when confronted with difficult departmental problems and the necessity of trying to understand decision making in a very complex and sophisticated Government organisation. In particular, most Under-Secretaries found their mastery of written English insufficient to enable them to grasp readily the contents of documents, files and reports, even though Departments allocated officers to assist them. Now only three Under-Secretaries, Messrs. Watson, Abe and Tabua,2 reside regularly in Port Moresby. The remainder live in their electorates and visit Port Moresby briefly and at infrequent intervals.

In an effort to get some closer association it was suggested that Under-Secretaries should undertake to spend the week prior to each parliamentary session in Port Moresby and some time after each session. In addition, it was proposed that the four Under-Secretaries who are members of the Administrator’s Council should arrange to prolong their stay in Port Moresby at times of Council meetings. This has resulted in some improvement in contact but with two or three exceptions Under-Secretaries do not spend nearly sufficient time with their Departments to fulfill the intention of the Under-Secretary system. With the next election only a year away and most Members in fear of losing their seats there is not much possibility of greater attention to departmental responsibilities.

If there is to be constitutional advance with some Members assuming greater executive responsibilities it is clear that those Members will have to spend a much greater period of time than heretofore with the allocated Department. A suitable arrangement might be for one week in four to be spent in Port Moresby during which there could be some collective training as well as despatch of Departmental business. In addition, Under-Secretaries or Secretaries would spend time with Departments during and after House sittings and after meetings of the Administrator’s Council. It is clear too that additional responsibility will dictate greater demands on Members’ facility in English, particularly in their speed and comprehension of written English. Given these conditions I feel confident that there is sufficient executive material awaiting development.

I attach reports on Under-Secretaries from Departments where the system has been more successful ... 3
