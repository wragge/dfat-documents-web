# 150 Minute, Swift To Warwick Smith

Canberra, 12 December 1967

_Administrators Letter of 23rd June_1

This can’t be considered sensibly without an agreed understanding of _what_ the Minister must keep, and what can be left to the Ministerial Member.

2\. How do we get a written down policy framework within which the Ministerial Members can work? Can someone list any examples of decisions the Ministerial Member can’t make e.g. budgetary framework, future financial commitments, etc., and those he can—? where the schools were placed, as distinct from how many there’d be.

3\. ‘Policy’ is too vague a term. I think someone will have to do a more concrete paper.

_Letter of 23rd November_2

4\. I think there should be no move to reduce the number of official members until we see what kind of a House we will have.

5\. Bottom of page 1. I think the notion of a body of experts within the House of Assembly staff is a very doubtful one. Too easy for there to be the attraction of pulling the Administrator’s nose—and responsibilities of administration unlikely to be understood ...

6\. No particular comments on portfolio suggestions.
