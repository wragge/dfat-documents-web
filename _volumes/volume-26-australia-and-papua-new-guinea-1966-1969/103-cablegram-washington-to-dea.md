# 103 Cablegram, Washington To Dea

7 April 1967

1374\. Secret 

**South Pacific consultations**

... Informal and exploratory discussions on the Pacific Island Territories took place in Washington on 5, 6, and 7 April between Australian, British, New Zealand and United States officials. Highlights of the discussions are set forth in the following paragraphs.

1\. _Importance and political future_

A general aim should be to encourage political evolution in such a way as to maintain the stability of the area and to prevent the entry of influences injurious to the interests of the indigenous peoples of the administering powers.

To this end the maintenance of a continuing close association, whether by constitutional provision or by agreement, with a metropolitan power, should be an objective in the political development of each territory. Since it is the reality of association rather than the form which is significant, retention of goodwill of the people of the territory concerned is of first importance. Where possible an ultimate status combining full self-government and constitutional association with a metropolitan power is to be preferred.

Some parts of the area, e.g., certain United States territories and Papua and New Guinea, are regarded by their respective metropolitan powers as of greater strategic importance than others. Nevertheless, it was agreed that the area as a whole is strategically important. Although there is no current external threat, it is desirable to ensure that security is maintained and so far as possible to avoid the fragmentation of the area into a series of unattached and non-viable communities.

2\. _United Nations aspects_

(A) Trusteeship Council

It was felt that it would be in the interest of the four governments to maintain the Trusteeship Council as a principal organ of the United Nations. When the Nauru trusteeship agreement is terminated, it should if need arises be argued that the Council can and should continue to function notwithstanding the impossibility of maintaining parity between the administering and non-administering members.

(B) Visiting Missions

It was generally recognized that visiting missions from the Committee of 24 to certain Pacific territories would involve unacceptable risks and in such cases the administering power concerned should be supported in resisting such visits. Australian, British, and United States representatives saw advantage in present circumstances in resisting visiting missions from the Committee of 24 to Pacific territories generally.

_[matter omitted]_

(D) The Committee Of 24

It was recognized that the question of continuing members{hip} of and cooperation with the Committee Of 24 needed continuing reassessment between the four powers, bearing in mind the desirability of acting in concert.

_[matter omitted]_

(G) General

It was considered that in settling their position on U.N. draft resolutions concerned with the Pacific territories there should be consultations among the four powers, bearing in mind the desirability of their acting and voting in concert whenever possible.

3\. _Development and the role of the South Pacific Commission_1

The need to maintain an active policy of social and economic progress throughout the Pacific area was recognized.

The South Pacific Commission continued to make a valuable contribution, especially in encouraging participation in regional affairs by the indigenous peoples ...

_[matter omitted]_

It was recognized that it would be desirable for the work program of the South Pacific Commission to be strengthened and expanded.

4\. _Japanese relationship with the Pacific Islands area_  
It was generally recognized that current Japanese interests in the Pacific Islands area are economic rather than political or strategic ... Interest was expressed in the possibility that Japan would cooperate in the development of the islands through the provision of funds or technical assistance and through trade.  


5\. _Arrangements for future consultation_

It was agreed that the four governments should, through their representatives in Canberra, and through other means, keep each other informed on a confidential basis of policies and developments in each of their territories, and that other four-power meetings should from time to time be arranged as occasion requires.

It was agreed that the government of France, which also has territorial responsibilities in the South Pacific area, should at the earliest convenient opportunity be invited to take part in a discussion with the four governments of matters affecting the future of the area.

1 The South Pacific Commission (SPC) was formed in 1947 by colonial powers for the purpose of cooperation in social and economic fields. The original members of the Commission were Australia, Britain, New Zealand, the Netherlands and France. Indigenous participation was encouraged from 1950 with the establishment of the South Pacific Conference. It provided Islander representatives with the opportunity to discuss and to make recommendations on matters within the jurisdiction of the SPC.
