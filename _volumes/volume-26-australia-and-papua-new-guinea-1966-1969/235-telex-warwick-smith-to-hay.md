# 235 Telex, Warwick Smith To Hay

Canberra, 18 October 1968

7497\. Unclassified Priority 

[_matter omitted_]

... I am concerned that no repeat no indigenes are currently being trained to full professional levels in key areas such as agricultural science, forestry and veterinary science as [I] believe it important (a) intrinsically (b) for political reasons that some indigenes be qualified to take senior and top Administration posts in these fields as a matter of urgency. [I] recognise that only a handful will be needed in each category but the point is that present nil position is quite indefensible. Consider every endeavour should be made to place some scholarship holders in Australian universities in these fields commencing 1969. I would envisage only a few scholarships each year since numbers needed at full professional level should be small.

[I] understand immediate difficulty for 1969 is dearth of school leaver matriculants to Australian standard qualified for science courses. In my view matter is of such urgency that we should canvass all possible sources for suitable scholarship [holders]1 to come to Australia in 1969—e.g. private secondary scholarship holders in Australia, science students at university, diplomates or advanced students from Vudal and Bulolo or even young teachers now teaching in Government or mission schools.

The universities would have to be approached very soon to ensure availability of places and any special dispensation that may be needed for matriculation.

Glad your early advice on acceptance this proposition in general and, if you agree, what specific action is possible for 1969.2

2  Hay replied that ‘We accept the urgent need and are willing to do everything possible’. He noted that the Administration planned to offer one or more scholarships in 1969 in the key areas mentioned by Warwick Smith. He discussed various attempts and ideas regarding recruitment and suggested that places at appropriate Australian universities be booked immediately (telex 8681, 30 October 1968, NAA: A452, 1968/5647). Concern was also expressed on problems associated with ‘middle level’ vocations needed for Territory development. On 8 October, Hay had telexed DOET: ‘Provision of middle level skills in various specialities could be handled through Territory tertiary institutions. Real problem here is lack of co-ordination of local tertiary institutions. UPNG will not accredit or oversee Bulolo, Vudal and primary teachers’ colleges because entry quality is too low and quality of applicants too low because ex high school students perceive no link with university and, therefore, no prospect of later improvement of qualifications. This problem can only be overcome by establishment of [a] supra-institutional co-ordinating body authorised to control recruitment, guidance, selection and allocation of scholarships/traineeships to all tertiary institutions’ (telex 8102, ibid.). Amid news that a number of vocational institutions were suffering serious student shortages for 1969, Barnes later approved a request to the Administrator ‘to submit his proposals for machinery to co-ordinate the distribution of school leavers among tertiary institutions’ (see submission, Reseigh to Barnes, 23 April 1969, ibid.).
