EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

In July, 1965 Cabinet decided to seek United Nations aid for projects in Papua and New Guinea, including the establishment of a secondary teacher training college at Goroka, New Guinea, under the Special Fund Sector of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

The conclusion of a basic agreement for aid from the Special Fund sector of the UNDP is a prerequisite for the implementation of projects by the UNDP and the Specialised Agencies. The Special Fund basic Agreement will provide a model for further agreements under which projects will be undertaken by other organs of the United Nations, such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

The basic Agreement with the Special Fund sector of the UNDP required protracted negotiation, mainly on the question of granting privileges and immunities. A United Nations lawyer visited Australia last year to try to resolve the differences between the United Nations’ and Australia’s positions. The Australian position on these matters will now be recorded in an exchange of letters which are to be signed immediately after the signature of the Agreement.

The Cabinet directive on United Nations aid for Papua and New Guinea provided for consultations between the Ministers for External Affairs, Territories and the Treasurer. In accordance with that decision the approval of all three Ministers has been obtained to the text of the draft basic Agreement.
