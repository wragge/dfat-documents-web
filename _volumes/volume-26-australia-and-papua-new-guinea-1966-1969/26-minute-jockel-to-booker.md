# 26 Minute, Jockel To Booker

Canberra, 11 March 1966

Top Secret

[_matter omitted_]1

2\. Whose job is it, I wonder, to state what our national interests are in respect of TPNG? As the draft rightly says the submission2 rests its case on defence considerations and on international pressures.

3\. I wonder what we think as a Department? Would it be something like the following:

(i) The honourable fulfilment of our international commitments and of our pledges to the indigenous people to advance them to the stage of being able to look after their own affairs in a modern world.

(ii) The achievement of conditions which will safeguard the general interests of Australians who have settled in TPNG and developed their livelihood there with the encouragement of the Government.

(iii) As elsewhere among our neighbours, the creation of conditions of stability and viable national institutions.

(iv) Long–term friendship and a degree of orientation towards Australia.

4\. I myself cannot see that the Territory is ‘vital’ to us in the sense that we must ensure that it remains within our sphere of influence at all costs. Nor do I think that such measures as we can take will necessarily assure us of reaching the goals that are set out above. Despite the good record between us and TPNG up to date, the attitudes in the Territory could change as the political climate becomes more heightened, as the people become more subject to international influences of race consciousness, nationalisation of foreign interests etc., and as their own internal economic, social and communal problems take form with the growth of their aspirations.

5\. It seems to me that we have to go on much as we are, avoiding both over-commitment and disengagement. I do not think that any attempt now to make a definitive pronouncement about the ultimate future would help to secure what we want. On the contrary, it could do harm. And in view of the inherent uncertainties about the future it is better avoided.

6\. These are just random observations to help you in your thankless task.

1 Jockel’s minute was a response to a draft paper on the DOT submission prepared for Booker by Smith. The paper was forwarded to Jockel by Booker with the comment: ‘I have not yet looked at this myself, but you might like to read it meanwhile’ (II March 1966, NAA: A 1838, 936/5).
