# 313 Minute, Kelloway To Besley

Canberra, 4 September 1969

Confidential

**Discussion with Administrator—3rd September**

Present: Minister, Kelloway, Administrator, Whitrod, Sheekey—Special Branch

• The discussion covered mainly the Rabaul situation as known to Administrator at 10.00 a.m.

• The Administrator gave us a copy of your 28511—the Minister had not shown me previous reports.

• The telex dictated by Hay2 was agreed by me as a very fair summary of the action endorsed by the Minister but a few points are worth adding.

• The Minister decided that a daily sitrep should be sent to the P.M.—Hay undertook to advise you of this.

• I raised the point of public reaction in Australia—the Minister says he is not worried by this.

• Hay mentioned that the general approach had been discussed with the Secretary earlier in the morning and he was in agreement.

• The telex says ‘plans’ to move another 500 police—the Administrator said that he could move them on his own authority when the time was ripe and the Minister seemed to acquiesce in this.

• The Minister is interested in the commissioner approach—which was introduced into the discussion by the Minister but after some discussion accepted Hay’s recommendation that this move should not be made at present.

• Hay is unwilling to make any concession which appears to be yielding to pressure; he is prepared to contemplate use of PIR rather than this but seems to me to be actively looking for acceptable alternative.

• Hay also considers that appointment of a commissioner will quite possibly emerge from a debate in the House.

• The Minister asked Whitrod about police/demonstrator ratios. Whitrod said without batons probably two police to one Tolai—with batons one policeman to five Tolai. The Minister said batons could be essential.

• The adequacy of information from Rabaul was discussed. Emanuel has been concentrating on pro-council groups for last few days and but for this would probably have been able to give advance warning of demonstration. Whitrod remarked that TPNG did not have the type of specialist operators needed for very good information.

• Whitrod considers stealing charge re key3 is probably wrong—will have to prove intent to retain and this may be difficult.

• I suggested that 1,000 police in Rabaul would provoke strong public reaction in Australia—Hay said there was little sign of this so far and Minister thought public would support maintenance [of] law and order. I did not press the point.

1 2 September, Besley to Hay. It conveyed the views of the Defence Committee (see Document 311). After listing points raised by the Committee on which action was required before further decisions or recommendations could be made, Besley wrote that ‘It is clear that there will be no support for move without firm recommendation from Minister (more tangible than oral recommendation) and full discussions between him and other Ministers’. Besley asked that the message be passed immediately to Barnes and Warwick Smith (NAA: A452, 1969/4001).

2 Document 312.

3 Tomot (on 2 September) and Kereku (4 September) were arrested and charged respectively with unlawful possession and stealing of the council keys. Both were released on bail (see telex SIGS921, Hayes to Parkinson, 5 September 1969, NAA: A452, 1969/2889). A third Matuangan leader to be charged was Deputy Chairman Daniel Rumet.
