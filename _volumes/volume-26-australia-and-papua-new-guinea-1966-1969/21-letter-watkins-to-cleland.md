# 21 Letter, Watkins To Cleland

Port Moresby, 1 March 1966

**re: Constitutional Committee**

The Constitutional Committee met yesterday morning and considered the draft questionnaire which had been drawn up by a Sub-Committee.1 After much discussion the questionnaire reached a final form and I enclose two (2) copies.

It was agreed that the approach to the people would not be made until after discussions in Canberra, as this meeting would have a great bearing on the approach to be made.

A Sub-Committee consisting of Messrs. Guise, Watkins, Brokam, Scragg, Stuntz, McCarthy, Downs, Abe and Giregire was appointed to draw up a list of subjects touching on special relationships and other matters which it was considered should be discussed by the Committee in Canberra. This Sub-Committee would meet at 2 p.m. on the 1st March, 1966.

The Committee resolved to ask the House to appoint Mr. B. Holloway2 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mr. Bloomfield.3

CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSE

DRAFT QUESTIONNAIRE

1\. Do the people consider that the present composition of the House meets the needs of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea?

2\. Should the number of electorates and hence number of members be changed, i.e. are there enough electorates or too many or too few?

3\. Should there be more rigid qualifications for candidates, e.g. ability to read and write English or Pidgin or Motu, specified standard of education, etc.?

4\. Is the present method of counting, i.e. the voluntary preferential system, satisfactory or should a first past the post system be instituted?

5\. Do you think it is necessary we should still have Special Electorates?

6\. Should all elected positions in the House of Assembly be open to all persons regardless of race, or should some seats be reserved for non-indigenous inhabitants of the Territory.

7\. Should there be official members in the House, if so, should the numbers remain as at present or should these be restricted to specific positions?

8\. Do you think the legislature should have one House or two Houses?

9\. Do you think that a period of internal self-government is necessary before other changes, and if so, how quickly should this take place?

10\. Is it the feeling of the people that they want Papua and New Guinea to become one country?

11\. 

_Citizenship_

What are your views on the following:—

(a) Should Papua become a Trust Territory with New Guinea and Papuans become Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens?

(b) Should New Guinea become an Australian Territory and New Guineans become Australian citizens rather then Australian protected persons?

(c) Should there be a Papua and New Guinea citizenship?

(d) If so, should it be in close association with Australia?

12\. These are the important questions but have you any other matters you would like to mention to the Committee?
