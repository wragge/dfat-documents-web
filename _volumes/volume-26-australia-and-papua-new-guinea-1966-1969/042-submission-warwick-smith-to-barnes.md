# 042 Submission, Warwick Smith To Barnes

Canberra, undated

**Papua/New Guinea police force**

The Administration have advised me that the Police Executive Association met and subsequently told the Police Commissioner that they considered that unrest in regard to wages and conditions was getting out of hand, and that a situation worse than anything previously experienced could result.

2\. The Administration advised yesterday that a Territory-wide police strike is expected on 27th May in the absence of action.1

3\. With your approval the Administrator was authorised on 11/5/66 to make a statement on 16th May embracing the following:

(a) improved accommodation buildings—provided Administration was satisfied that level of action proposed and terms of the announcement would not result in unmanageable repercussions from officers other than police.

(b) an in principle statement on payment of a full cash wage (without stating levels or date of commencement).

(c) the principle that location[,] uniform[,] station-in-charge and camping allowances would be paid (provided that location and camping allowances would be comparable with local public service rates and that submissions be made in normal way on rates for uniform and station-in-charge allowances).

(d) twenty-four recommendations of the Police Advisory Committee which are regarded as matters for local decision.

4\. The Administration have now urged in the strongest terms that authority be given in respect of (b) above to state 1/7/66 as the date from which a full cash wage would be payable and to state the N.C.O. and O/R2 rates.

5\. They have also strongly recommended that for morale purposes the pending reclassification of (expatriate) sub-inspectors be referred to in the proposed statement.

6\. There is no formal approval yet for a specific date or for specified new rates of pay for N.C.O.’ sand other ranks, but these are ready for approval. Subject to that the principal impediment to meeting the request in paragraph 4 has been that from the viewpoint of Department of the Army an announcement that the Police cash wage will be introduced on 1st July can only be made if a similar announcement can be made in regard to the P.I.R. 3 at the same time. This requires resolution of some questions still outstanding regarding the basis of conversion from cash plus kind to all-cash wage for members of the P.I.R. (so far as appropriate in their circumstances). These questions are principally related to the higher value P.I.R. ration scales.

7\. I would regard it as reasonable for the P.I.R. to apply a non-reduction principle of some kind, but they have problems in reducing their present ration scale at all, and additionally in having two scales (perhaps with a cash adjustment) operating side by side. With regard to families ‘living-out’ (said to number 69) because of the very high differential in cash that would result from the simple application of the non-reduction principle, we have suggested (and Army and Treasury are considering it) that the cash element corresponding to rations in the new converted P.I.R. scale should be comparable with that of the Police Force and the Public Service and the additional element required to maintain the non-reduction principle should be provided by continuing to issue a corresponding quantity of rations in kind. Such issue would in accordance with the non-reduction principle be reducible in the event of increases in wages of the recipient. This is not at present acceptable to Army. There is also the problem of men in barracks, which are the bulk of the P.I.R. (about 700). We have not proposed this, but want to see the difference in scale of rations reduced or eliminated.

8\. At this stage, however, there seems to be no impediment to a general statement by Army in parallel with the Administrator’s statement on 16th May, that the P.I.R. would so far as applicable to their circumstances be placed on a full cash wage to apply from the same date as that for the Police, such a statement by Army being subject to Treasury agreement.

9\. With regard to paragraph 4 above, if the previous impediment arising out of the circumstances of the P.I.R. is removed, it remains to consider any problems involved for Territories in the Administrator’s stating a firm date for the commencement of the cash wage and stating also the actual rates proposed. Provision is made in the draft estimates for 1966/67 to cover the estimated costs of conversion to the full cash wage (as is also the case with the proposed cost for improved accommodation and for the allowances referred to above) and on the assumption that pay and conditions for the Police Force would in any case receive an extremely high priority I do not see any difficulty from the Estimates point of view in making such a statement provided it is not (as at one stage the Administration was suggesting) expressed as being ‘an interim measure’.

10\. In approving a statement by the Administrator substantially on the lines of the attached draft4 you would be giving approval to:—

(a) introduction of a cash wage for N.C.O.’s and other ranks of the Police Force on 1st July, 1966, and the rises to be paid.

(b) the introduction on the same date of a locality allowance and a camping allowance at the same rates as those now applying to local officers of the Public Service.

(c) the principles of a station-in-charge allowance and clothing allowance for plain clothes duty (the actual rates to be determined).

11\. The reclassification of the sub-inspectors referred to in paragraph 5 is the subject of a separate minute. 

12\. In the light of these developments and in order to support the Police Commissioner in his efforts to restore morale in the Police Force I _recommend_ that the substance of the attached draft statement, involving approval of the matters referred to in paragraph 10 be approved, the final text being left to the decision of the Administrator and Mr Swift after consultation with the Police Commissioner, the Public Service Commissioner5 and the Force Commander;6 the issue of the statement being subject to clearance in respect of Army’s position (any Army statement requiring Territory approval).

**Industrial unrest: announcements on police and PIR conditions of service**

_In statements of 16 May—details of which were publicised in the South Pacific Post—Cleland and Hunter announced changes to conditions of service in the police force and the Pacific Islands Regiment._

_According to an Administration press release, Cleland stated that_

> _The Territory Police Force is to have a fortnightly cash wage. Other measures to improve living and working conditions of the Police Force also are being implemented ... the introduction of a cash wage is one of the recommendations of the Police Advisory Committee, which recently conducted a full review of conditions in the Police Force. The cash wage will follow closely the rates fixed for the local Public Service._
> 
> _Members of the Force serving now will have their present system of cash wage and issues in kind converted to a full cash wage. Under the full cash wage system members of the Force who are accommodated as single men in barracks will have deductions made from their pay for messing and quarters and other facilities supplied. Other married members will purchase their own food and meet their own living costs and if they live in Administration houses will pay a rental charge on the same basis as public servants._
> 
> _Under the new scale, adult Constables will receive from $480 to $840 per annum, depending on length of service and skills. First-class Constables will receive from $880 to $920, and Senior Constables from $940 to $980. The rates for Sergeants Third-class will be from $1,040 to $1,080, and higher grades of Sergeants will receive up to a maximum of $1,260 per annum._
> 
> _It is expected that the new cash wage system will be introduced on and from 1st July next Detachments will be given full explanations as soon as possible and the Commissioner of Police will visit all Divisional Headquarters within the next week to hold discussions with members of the Force._
> 
> _The Administrator said that a system of Location Allowances, designed to compensate members who are providing their own food for the higher costs in certain areas of the Territory, will also become effective from that date. Provision is also made for camping allowance to be paid. These allowances will be paid at the rate applicable to local public servants. The principle of introducing a station-in-charge allowance, and of a clothing allowance for members who are required to work in plain clothes, has also been accepted._
> 
> _Measures are to be taken in certain areas to improve accommodation presently provided, as well as to increase the availability of accommodation for serving members. Funds for this purpose will be included in the Works Programme for l966/67._
> 
> _Furlough benefits for members of the Force are available under the new Police Ordinance ... Cleland added that a number of other recommendations made by the Police Advisry’ Committee also had been approved and would be implemented as soon as possible. Full details of these will be made available to the Police Association forthwith. 1_

_Hunter’s brief statement recorded that all members of the PIR would be placed on a cash wage at rates aligned with those of the police force. 2 He said that full details of these rates would probably be announced before 1 July, the date of their implementation. Furthermore, the new pay code would be accompanied by other improvements, such as furlough. 3_

_Three days later, Cleland cabled that the ‘tension has gone out of the situation here in Moresby’ and that ‘reports through Special Branch and my own sources indicate quietness and no adverse reaction in other towns and centres ’.4 He commented that an ‘adverse reaction’ had occurred in Port Moresby on 17 May due to misunderstandings on the question of deductions, but that this had been countered through an address by the Police Commissioner. Meanwhile, police were making enquiries regarding ‘comparative rates past, present and future’, details of which were being supplied by the Administration. Referring apparently to the belief that discrepancies between PIR and police rates of pay were the cause of dissatisfaction in the constabulary, 5 Cleland closed by stressing to Warwick Smith that it was ‘essential that [the} Army get no further gains against the Police’._

**Survey of the border between West Irian and PNG**

_Following confirmation in 1964 that the border between West Irian and PNG was not in dispute—and that it remained simply to define the boundary on the ground1—Australia and Indonesia held technical discussions in Canberra from 21-24 May 1966. A statement issued by the Department of External Affairs explained that_

> _The purpose of these discussions was to draw up a detailed programme for the survey work, to consider questions of staffing, supply, transport and communications and to fix a time for the commencement of operations._
> 
> _It has been agreed to recommend to Governments that work should begin as soon as practicable and it is hoped that a reconnaissance of the various points along the northern part of the border where markers are to be placed and the necessary clearing of helicopter landing pads will have begun by the middle of June. Though progress will be dependent on weather conditions, it is hoped that meridian markers will have been established at intervals up to the headwaters of the Sepik River, and if practicable also into the area of the Star Mountains, by the end of the year. Clearing and survey of the lines between these markers, and the establishment of a programme of work for survey and demarcation of the line to the south of the mountains will be the subject of further talks at a later stage._
> 
> _The reconnaissance of sites for markers and the necessary clearing of bush associated therewith will be carried out by joint Indonesian/Australian teams using Mi4 helicopters provided by Indonesia and Bell G3 helicopters provided by Australia. After each site has been approximately located, Indonesian and Australian teams will make concurrent astronomical surveys. The results for each survey will then be correlated and a point fixed on for the erection of a market: The bases for operations in the northern part of the border will be Sukarnapura, Waris, Green River and Telefomin.2_

_A confidential cablegram to the Australian Embassy in Djakarta added that ‘survey and clearing teams will not carry military weapons but will be accompanied by security teams’, with each security team responsiblefor protection from interference from its respective territory. 3 It was also noted that the Indonesians were ‘somewhat concerned over the problem of villages which might be found to be astride the border but accepted our position that ... agreed markers placed in position along the line of the border would not become permanent markers until accepted as such in each case by both Governments ... [and that] the marking of the border in respect of such villages should be determined on an ad hoc basis between both Governments when the occasion arose’._

_An August report by Foreign Affairs noted that border work was proceeding well and commented on the ‘easy relations existing on the project between both sides’.4_

1  In a supporting letter to Barnes of 16 May, the General Secretary of the Police Association, A.R. Walker, noted that a Police Advisory Committee had been established in December 1965 to investigate the causes of low morale and that, although it had submitted its report on 31 March 1966, little action had been taken by authorities. He warned Barnes that reliable sources indicated a ‘disaster’ in the form of a Territory-wide strike if no announcement were made (NAA: A452, 1966/1959). Later, in discussions with Commissioner Cole in Canberra, Barnes said ‘the report of the committee ... was a good report and [he] felt it was necessary to push ahead with the implementation of it’ (minute, Swift to Payne, 6 June 1966, ibid. A copy of the report may be found in ibid.).

2  Although Hunter’s statement created the impression of parity between PIR and constabulary conditions of service, agreement on this matter had not been reached between Anny and DOT. Army views were reflected in the earlier assertion of Minister for the Army Malcolm Fraser that ‘pay for native members [of the PIR] should include a loading over and above the scales established for the Police and Administration servants if the soldier is to be rewarded for the service he gives’ (see letter, Fraser to Barnes, 15 April 1966, NAA:A452, 1966/2270). For interdepartmental discussion of PIR conditions, see NAA: A452, 1968/4426.

3  In Canberra, Barnes ‘reported orally to the Cabinet on discontent amongst members of the Pacific Islands Regiment, the Police and student body in Papua New Guinea on the question of pay and conditions, and the steps which had been taken, or would be taken, to meet this problem’ (Cabinet decision no. 250, 17 May 1966, NAA: A5839, 250).

4  Telex A354, Cleland to Warwick Smith, 19 May 1966, NAA: A452, 1966/2270.

5  A Department of Territories paper prepared for discussions with Army representatives remarked that ‘Disparity is the cause of police discontent. Comparability between the two was observed until 1962 approx. Whether justified or not, police themselves make the comparison’ (paper entitled ‘Notes for meeting 20/5/66’ ibid.).

1  In answer to a parliamentary question of 15 September 1964, Hasluck commented that ‘there is no matter in dispute with regard to the border between the Australian-administered part of New Guinea and West New Guinea. [That is, there was no dispute over the traditionally accepted line of the border along the 141st meridian and the western bulge of the Fly River.] The only matter requiring attention is the marking of the border on the ground. Last June when I was in Djakarta I reached a very ready understanding with [Indonesian Foreign Minister] Dr Subandrio that we could proceed with arrangements for the marking of the border’ (Current notes, vol. 35, 1964, p. 38).
