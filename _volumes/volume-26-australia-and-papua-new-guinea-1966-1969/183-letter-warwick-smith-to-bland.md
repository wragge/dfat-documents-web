# 183 Letter, Warwick Smith To Bland

Canberra, l7 May 1968

At the meeting between the Ministers for Defence, Army and Territories which was held in Mr. Fairhall’s office on 18th October, 1967,2 Mr. Barnes mentioned the need to bring about a relationship between the Army and the developing civil government of the Territory and it was agreed that this Department should take up with Army and Defence the procedures that should be followed under the new constitutional system.

The Papua and New Guinea Act has been amended to provide for seven elected members of the House to be appointed as Ministerial Members. These members will also be members of the Administrator’s Executive Council which will have an increased role in advising and assisting the Administrator over the whole range of Territory business.

This represents a further step in the process begun some time ago of developing consultation between the Administrator, acting on behalf of the Australian Government, and the elected members of the House of Assembly, thus enabling them to have a greater influence in Territory government. Decisions on matters of policy and on major administrative issues will continue to rest with the Administrator under the Minister.

I have discussed with the Administrator how defence matters would fit into the new system. We suggest that, without prejudice to any decision regarding security information that should be withheld, the Administrator’s Executive Council might be consulted on plans and activities of the Services, including such matters as proposals to set up new defence establishments, the needs of the Forces, civic action programmes, etc. Papers on appropriate subjects could perhaps be presented to the Council by the Administrator and it is contemplated that the Force Commander or other appropriate officer could attend to participate in the discussion.

In our view such an approach would help to develop an appreciation of problems affecting both the Services and the civil administration and an understanding of the Services’ role in the community, as well as avoiding possible feeling on the part of members of the Administrator’s Executive Council that the Council was not in fact being treated by the Government ‘as the principal instrument of policy in the Territory under the Administrator’.

In addition, the Force Commander might be asked to attend a meeting of the Administrator’s Executive Council each year when departmental estimates are being discussed. This would enable him to present to the Council the Government’s plans and programmes for the Command in the ensuing year. It might be useful if this procedure were to commence in June or July of this year.

I should be grateful to have your reactions to these suggestions.
