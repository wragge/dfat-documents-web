# 179 Letter, Warwick Smith To Hay

Canberra, 10 May 1968

Following the discussions in Canberra on the 6th and 7th May1 I now attach a check list of conclusions reached and points for further action.

[_matter omitted_]

Whilst I have assumed that the points as expressed in the attachment are a reasonable record I do of course expect that you will advise if there are any points on which your understanding is significantly at variance.

**Attachment 1**

[_matter omitted_]

_Ministerial Members system_

(I) Role of Assistant Administrators

1\. Public Service Commissioner to examine need to amend ‘Administrative Arrangements’ Ordinance since it appears that Assistant Administrators would in future—

• as assistants to the Administrator with no (departmental) administrative functions in their own right;

• discharge responsibilities assigned to them by the Administrator; In form they would not have authority but in practice they would of course carry out what tasks the Administrator assigned to them.

(II) Nominations Committee

1\. Department to produce regulations but would not specify that a member of the Nominations Committee could not be nominated for Ministerial office. Further regulations could be made if necessary.

(III) Ministerial Members

Principles in Departmental paper C. W.P.l (attachment I) adopted.2

Department to reword last two points of composite C.W.P.2 paper (attachment 2) so as not to distinguish with regard to the sharing of authority with the Departmental Head with regard to the making of policy decisions and administrative decisions.3 There would be no reference to the I.D.C.C. in C.W.P.2.
