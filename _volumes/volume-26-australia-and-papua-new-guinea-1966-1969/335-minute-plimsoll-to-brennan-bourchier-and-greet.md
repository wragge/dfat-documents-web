# 335 Minute, Plimsoll To Brennan, Bourchier And Greet

Canberra, 24 November 1969

**Foreign Service Training for TPNG Officers2**

I have read Mr Greet’s minute of 13th November3 and also Mr Bourchier’s note of 19th November, with its attached paper.4

2\. Mr Bourchier’s paper sets out a number of points on which consultations with the Department of External Territories should be undertaken. One question that should be examined is the setting up of a nucleus in Port Moresby for a New Guinea Department of External Affairs; this would include the assembling of archives, and the training of officers. We also need to consider whether the time is coming when this Department of External Affairs should have a representative in Port Moresby, and what his function should be (I would like that point further examined before it is put to Territories).

3\. But on the current proposition, to train two men from New Guinea in the Department of External Affairs, there are some points needing immediate attention:

(a) Should they be seconded to the Department of External Affairs? I would see great advantage in their being integrated into this Department for a few years, with special arrangements (including visits) to allow them to keep their links with New Guinea.

(b) Rates of pay etc.

(c) If married, an officer should be accompanied to Canberra by his wife. Suitability of the wife should be a factor in selection. Moreover there could be some training given to the wife simultaneously with her husband undertaking training. For example she could be helped to improve her proficiency in English, or could do a course at the A.N.U.

(d) External Affairs should participate in the selection of men.

(e) I do not rule out additional courses, for example at the A.N.U., being given to the men selected in order to broaden or otherwise improve their education.

(f) At this stage, Europeans should not be selected. The need of greatest priority is the training of indigenous men in New Guinea.

1 R.J. Greet, Diplomatic Staff Officer, DEA.

2 See Documents 322 and 326.

3 Addressed to Doig, Bourchier and R.B. Hodgson (Director, Foreign Service Training Course, DEA), the minute introduced an attached paper on ‘our ideas on the type of man to be selected’, ‘E.A.’s role in the selection process’ and the ‘programme of training’. Greet asked for detailed comment after which the matter could be pursued further with DOET (NAA: A1838, 936/6/10 part 1).

4 A minute to Greet in which Bourchier responded to Greet’s minute and expanded on an earlier paper (probably Document 323) that discussed foreign service training for PNG officers (ibid.).
