# 61 Letter, Warwick Smith To Cleland

Canberra, 16 August 1966.

Representations have recently been made which suggest that there has been an increase in illegal squatting on leased land in the Gazelle Peninsula.

[_matter omitted_]

The Minister is concerned at these reports of illegal squatting and I should appreciate it if you could inform me whether action is to be taken against such squatters, or alternatively what view the Administration takes of the matter.

I appreciate that one of the causes of squatting is frustration over the slow legal process and in particular over the time taken between a decision of the Chief Land Titles Commissioner and the hearing of an appeal by the Supreme Court. It would be helpful to know whether you can see anything that can be done about this.
