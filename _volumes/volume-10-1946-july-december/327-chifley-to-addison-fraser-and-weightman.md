# 327 Chifley to Addison, Fraser and Weightman

## Letter CANBERRA, 18 December 1946

INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DIRECTIVE TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IN AUSTRALIA

I am forwarding herewith copies of a draft directive to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia, prepared on the basis of the tasks allotted to them by the participating Governments, as set out in the telegrams exchanged between the Governments in connection with the organisation of the British Commonwealth Forces for the occupation of Japan.

The draft directive has been compiled by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia who have recommended that it should be issued to them by the Australian Government acting on behalf of the other British Commonwealth Governments participating in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. [1]

The draft is satisfactory to the Australian Government, and expresses the position correctly in regard to the relation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Australian Government machinery. I would observe, however, that, during the Prime Ministers' Conference in London last April, the Australian Government outlined its views as to the basis on which coordination of Empire Defence will be based, in so far as Australia and its Higher Defence Machinery are concerned. [2] At the same time, the Australian Government also referred to the relation of the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia to the views which it had expressed. In forwarding the draft directive, I would like to make it clear that, while its terms are appropriate to the present circumstances, the Australian Government does not necessarily accept the present set-up as the best and most suitable method of controlling the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Furthermore, the Australian Government does not consider the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia to be a suitable model for the future development of machinery for Empire Co-operation, and, when it has formulated into a detailed scheme the views expressed by it in London, it reserves the right to review, from its own angle and in the light of its conclusions, the set-up for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia.

INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DIRECTIVE TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF IN AUSTRALIA

INTRODUCTION

1\. This directive is issued to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia, on behalf of, and with the approval of, His Majesty's Governments in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and India, hereinafter referred to as the 'British Commonwealth Governments concerned'.

Purpose of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia 2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in Australia, hereinafter referred to as 'J.C.O.S.A.', has been set up on behalf of the British Commonwealth Governments concerned, to plan for and to control the British Commonwealth participation in the occupation of Japan as represented by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, hereinafter referred to as 'B.C.O.F.'.

3\. The formation of B.C.O.F., and the setting up of J.C.O.S.A., are regarded by the British Commonwealth Governments concerned as constituting further developments in British Commonwealth co- operation.

Composition of J.C. O. S.A.

4\. J.C.O.S.A. is to consist of the Australian Chiefs of Staff and representatives of the Chiefs of Staff in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and of the Commander-in-Chief, India, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the three Indian Services.

Relationship of J.C.O.S.A. to the Australian Defence Machinery 5. J.C.O.S.A. is to look to the Australian Government machinery for:-

(a) The obtaining of inter-Governmental guidance on matters of political significance;

(b) Executive action to implement J.C.O.S.A. policy and decisions;

(c) Administrative machinery required for J.C.O.S.A. and B.C.O.F.

matters. This machinery may be augmented from the staffs of the over-seas members of J.C.O.S.A.

6\. For general administrative purposes and for the submission of matters requiring an inter-governmental exchange of views, J.C.O.S.A. is to be viewed as an extension of the Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee. This relationship, together with that existing between J.C.O.S.A. and other Australian Defence Machinery, is shown diagrammatically at Annexure I. [4]

7\. Owing to the distribution of duties between the Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Australian Defence Committee, whereby the primary function of the former is to deal with operational matters and strategical appreciations and the latter is the statutory advisory body on defence policy and on matters of policy or principle and important questions having a joint-Service or inter-Departmental defence aspect [5], the overseas members of J.C.O.S.A. are to sit as members of the Australian Defence Committee (Extended) when matters concerning overseas contingents of B.C.O.F. or concerning the Force as a whole are under consideration.

8\. On the initiative of the Minister for Defence or of members of J.C.O.S.A., consultations may be arranged between them on matters dealt with by J.C.O.S.A. or by the Extended Defence Committee.

Consultations may also be arranged between the Minister and the individual members of J.C.O.S.A. All decisions resulting from these consultations will be communicated as stated in paragraph 25 [below].

1 The Extended Defence Committee had recommended issuing the Directive 'for purposes of concise record and for guidance in setting up of a similar organisation in the future' (Defence Committee Minute 100/1946). A first draft prepared by the planning staff was approved by the Committee on 1 May for submission to the Australian Govt and thence to the other governments concerned; it was subsequently revised and approved in its penultimate form by the Committee in July. This draft was retained for consideration in the Defence Dept, in view of 'the relationship of J.C.O.S.A. to the Australian Higher Defence organisation and the Australian Government' (Defence Committee Minute 372/1946). A substantial alteration to paragraph 7 (see note 5) was approved by Shedden on 4 December; on 11 December Dedman sent the final draft to Chifley for approval and dispatch to other Commonwealth Govts.

2 See Volume IX, Document 200.

3 The draft was accepted by the U.K., Indian and N.Z. Govts in letters dated, respectively, 21 and 26 February and in March 1947.

On 5 August 1947 Chifley, as Acting Minister for Defence, formally signed the Directive.
