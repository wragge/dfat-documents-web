# 184 Embassy in Washington to Department of 1946 External Affairs

## Cablegram 1493 WASHINGTON, 30 October

FEC 276 TRADE UNIONS.

1\. Committee on democratic tendencies today unanimously adopted C4-009/8 with one minor alteration. Comes before steering committee 4 November. Australia took a leading part in the formulation of this paper and held chairmanship of the sub- committee which prepared it. Unless instructed to the contrary we shall support the paper in its final form.

2\. Your attention however is particularly directed to paragraph 16. This was inserted to prevent Zaibatsu, other employers, and militaristic and undemocratic societies from subsidizing or otherwise controlling unions, which was a common practice in prewar Japan.
