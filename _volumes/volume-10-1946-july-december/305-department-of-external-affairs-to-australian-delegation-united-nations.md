# 305 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

Cablegram UNY486 CANBERRA, 10 December 1946

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Disarmament.

Australian amendment [1] was designed to- (a) Bring about general regulations and reduction of armaments.

(b) Expedite fulfilment of terms of reference of Atomic Energy Commission.

(c) Establishment of adequate safeguards through single international instrument or treaty.

(d) Permanent international commission of control with powers of inspection, etc.

(e) Implementation of Article 26.

2\. It is regrettable that the Australian resolution covering these points is not now to the forefront of the debate. There may, however, be opportunities to put it to the vote as it stands in the absence of agreement on an alternative draft. If not, every endeavour should be made to have all points covered in any draft submitted to the vote. In particular it is important that the Disarmament Commission set up should have no restrictions on its voting or executive powers. The policy you are pursuing is in accordance with the above. We attach the greatest importance to the subject, and every effort by you will be required to ensure that the Assembly reaches definitive conclusions satisfactory to us.
