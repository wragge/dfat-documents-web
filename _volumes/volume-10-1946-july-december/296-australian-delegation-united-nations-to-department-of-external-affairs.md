Assembly 377.

The following is the text of the Australian Resolution on Veto as adopted by Committee One.

1\. The General Assembly mindful of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and having taken notice of the divergencies which have a-risen in regard to the application and interpretation of Article 27 of the Charter, 2. Earnestly requests the permanent Members of the Security Council to make every effort, in consultation with one another and with fellow Members of the Security Council to ensure that the use of the special voting privilege of its permanent Members does not impede the Security Council in reaching decisions promptly.

3\. Recommends to the Security Council the early adoption of practices and procedures, consistent with the Charter, to assist in reducing the difficulties in the application of Article 27 and to ensure the prompt and effective exercise by the Security Council of its functions.

4\. Further recommends that in developing such practices and procedures the Security Council take into consideration the views expressed by Members of the United Nations during the second part of the first session of the General Assembly.
