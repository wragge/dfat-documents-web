# 254 Mills to Evatt and Dedman

## Cablegram Paris 261 LONDON, 28 November 1946

Main developments at Conference [1] are as follows:-

(1) Walker has been elected to Executive Board for period of one year. Others elected include Sir John Maud, Archibald MacLeish, Radhakrishnan (India) and Chen (China). Geographical distribution not entirely satisfactory since eight members are from European countries. Board is now considering nomination of director- general. [2]

(2) In programme commission Australia pressed for greater emphasis on education and in sub-commission we are working to eliminate unpractical proposals.

(3) In administrative, legal and financial commissions Australia secured change of timetable to ensure that budget will only be fixed after programme commission has completed its examination.

There is much support for a more modest budget than that proposed by the Preparatory Commission.

1 The First General Conference of UNESCO was held at Paris from 19 November to 10 December.

2 Mills was instructed to support the candidature of Sir Julian Huxley who was elected to a two-year term.
