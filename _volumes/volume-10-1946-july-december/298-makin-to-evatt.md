# 298 Makin to Evatt

Cablegram UN961 NEW YORK, 9 December 1946, 12.57 a.m.

PERSONAL

I am greatly concerned at the extreme anxieties manifest in your telegram UNY.467 [1], and particularly your apparent thought that our Delegation has not exerted itself to the utmost in giving effect to your instructions. Every Member of our team has given you loyalty and constant service with marked ability. I am greatly disturbed at your criticism which I can but emphasise in the strongest possible terms is totally unjustified. Such criticisms are a source of terrific discouragement to men whose abilities and constant endeavours deserve something much different. You will by this time have seen our Assembly UN.376 [2] which I feel confident you will regard as an effective answer to the doubts expressed in your telegram.
