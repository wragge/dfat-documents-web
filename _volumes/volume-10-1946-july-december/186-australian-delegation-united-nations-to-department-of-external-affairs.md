# 186 Australian Delegation, United Nations, to Department of External Affairs

Cablegram United Nations 590 NEW YORK, 31 October 1946, 4.48 p.m.

SECRET

Assembly 62.

The following is the exact text of Molotov's proposal on disarmament (see our Assembly 52). [1]

'In accordance with Article II of the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Delegation submits for the consideration of the General Assembly the following proposal:

1\. in the interests of consolidating International peace and security and in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Organisation, the General Assembly considers a general reduction of armaments necessary.

2\. The implementation of the decision on the reduction of armaments should include as a primary objective the banning of the manufacture and use of atomic energy for Military purposes.

3\. The General Assembly recommends to the Security Council to provide for the practical achievement of the objectives set forth in the abovementioned paragraphs 1 and 2.

4\. The General Assembly calls upon the Governments of all States to render every possible assistance to the Security Council in this responsible undertaking, the accomplishment of which conforms to the establishment of stable peace and international Security and also serves the interests of the peoples by lightening their heavy economic burden caused by excessive expenditures for armaments which do not correspond to peaceful post war conditions.'

_

1 Molotov had foreshadowed the proposal in a speech in plenary session of the General Assembly on 30 October.
