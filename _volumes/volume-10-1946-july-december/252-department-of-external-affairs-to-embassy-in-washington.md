# 252 Department of External Affairs to Embassy in Washington

Cablegram 1660 CANBERRA, 27 November 1946

SECRET

Your 1604-Proposed Whaling Commission. [1]

In general we support proposal for a whaling commission. Details of U.S. proposals are being considered and we shall forward any comments as early as possible. [2]

Commission should be integrated into existing international organisation and we therefore support linking with F.A.O. [3]
