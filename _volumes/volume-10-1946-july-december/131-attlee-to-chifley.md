# 131 Attlee to Chifley

Cablegram D866 LONDON, 21 September 1946, 8.52 p.m.

TOP SECRET IMPORTANT

It is intended to publish shortly before Parliament re-assembles on the 8th October a white paper on our central organisation for defence, which will announce certain changes in the existing organisation, including the appointment of a Minister of Defence.

A summary of the white paper will be telegraphed to you for your information in the near future, but in the meantime I should be grateful if you would consider four paragraphs on Commonwealth collaboration which form part of the section of the white paper called 'Organisation for Collective Defence'. The text of these paragraphs is contained in my immediately following telegram. [1] If you have any comments to make on these paragraphs I should be glad to have them as soon as possible and at the latest by the end of the month since arrangements for printing must be made then.
