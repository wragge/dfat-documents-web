# 206 Department of External Affairs to Australian Delegation, United Nations

## Cablegram [UNY]348 CANBERRA, 11 November 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your UN.671-Refugees. [1]

Cabinet meets Tuesday morning. [2] Financial commitment is not defined and no reliable estimate given of obligation ultimately to be undertaken. We consider every Government should know more details of plans before being asked to make a firm commitment in advance. At least provision should be made for Governments to reconsider their positions as the problem becomes more clearly defined. In these circumstances it would seem unwise immediately to deprive non-contributors of voting rights.

2\. Attitude on type of organisation remains as stated. [3] Suggest this aspect be referred to committee and thereby test the support.

_

1 Dispatched to November, it sought urgent instructions for voting in Third Committee of the General Assembly on the draft constitution of the proposed refugee organisation.

2 in a departmental memorandum dated 12 November, Evatt was informed that Chifley would discuss the financial aspects of the matter either with him individually or in Cabinet. There is no record of any such Cabinet discussion on Tuesday 12 November, or later in 1946.
