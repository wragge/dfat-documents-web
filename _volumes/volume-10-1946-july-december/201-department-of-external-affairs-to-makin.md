# 201 Department of External Affairs to Makin

Cablegram [UNY]341 CANBERRA, 8 November 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET

Your UN.632. [1] Minister is disappointed at complete lack of support of Australia by South Africa both at Paris and United Nations in relation to matters where we had every reason to expect active co-operation.

2\. It is correct that Minister expressed unwillingness to embarrass Smuts and he will not do so. Without committing ourselves to vote or active support we shall gladly avoid any embarrassment.

_

1 Dispatched 5 November, it reported that Smuts had asked the Australian delegation to support South Africa's proposal to make the mandated territory of South West Africa part of South Africa.
