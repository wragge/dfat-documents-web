# 290 Evatt to Makin

## Cablegram UNY471 CANBERRA, 8 December 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Reference telegram UN.937 [1] just received.

Byrnes proposal is entirely unacceptable. It is simply appeasement of a claim which is completely unsupportable. It would be better to get ruling from Permanent Court of Justice than initiate procedure which gives powers not directly concerned right of consultation in respect of Japanese mandates and Nauru which seems to have been completely overlooked by Delegation. I am certain Bevin must appreciate implications of this move which rather suggests that a bargain has already been struck.
