# 199 Department of External Affairs to Bulcock

Cablegram 547 CANBERRA, 5 November 1946

SECRET

World Food Preparatory Commission. [1]

1\. For your background information Australian policy is to give no encouragement to additional specialised agencies or independent organisations as it is considered that any matter requiring attention of Government within the field of Economic and Social Council should be dealt with by the Council or a Commission set up by it.

2\. While you may participate in the full exploratory discussions of the present proposal you should not support a proposal which would involve the establishment of a new Organisation outside the Economic and Social Council.
