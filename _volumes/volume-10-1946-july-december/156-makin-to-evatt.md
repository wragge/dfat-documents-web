# 156 Makin to Evatt

Cablegram 1385 WASHINGTON, 5 October 1946, 4.41 p.m.

SECRET

I called on Dean Acheson today and made representations on Japanese whaling in the strongest possible terms. [1] I emphasized that this might well be taken as a precedent to justify the permanent rehabilitation of the Japanese whaling industry. I also stressed again that we believed that no Japanese crews at all should be allowed to participate, and that Australia was prepared to supply a substantial part of the necessary crews.

Acheson undertook to give my representations earnest consideration. He said he felt that the expedition would not constitute a precedent, because the Japanese had no legal or other right to plead a case before any Allied Body, and the Allies alone would decide the future of whaling in Japan. He repeated that the expedition was being undertaken in order to obtain food and oil at a time of great shortage. I pointed out, however, that the ships and equipment would not remain idle because we were offering to provide crews. in other words, we were offering to see that the required food was supplied but in a way that would not endanger Australia's interest.

I had heard that one section of the State Department was considering inviting Japan to the next Whaling Convention, so I touched on this during my conversation, pointing out that it would be unthinkable. Acheson replied that such an invitation would be 'quite absurd'.
