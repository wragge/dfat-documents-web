Cablegram [UNY]349 CANBERRA, 12 November 1946

MOST SECRET IMMEDIATE

Your UN.658. [1] Elections to Economic and Social Council.

Support should be given to New Zealand, United States, Turkey and Mexico (or a South American country).

2\. We understand that New Zealand may not be anxious to secure election because of staffing difficulties. Please ascertain their attitude. If they wish to stand assure them of our most active support. Delegation should do everything in its power to support them. [2]

3\. Objective if New Zealand is standing is to win them a seat and also consolidate position for Australia next year. If New Zealand is not standing Australia should still aim at consolidating position for next year unless it is certain that we would be elected this year. It is emphasised that Australia should not nominate unless election assured.

4\. You should make greatest possible use of Australian support for countries listed above to achieve these aims and to assist you flexibility has been left in case of Mexico and freedom has been left to you to select two other countries. Security Council list already cabled to you should also be used to advantage.

5\. Please advise position as it develops.

1 Dispatched 8 November, it proposed that Australia support New Zealand, the United States and Turkey and sought advice as to which other countries should be supported.

2 Cablegram UNY358 of 14 November advised that New Zealand was indeed 'most anxious' to secure election, and therefore was to be actively supported.
