# 264 Department of External Affairs to Makin and Bailey

## Cablegram [UNY]434 CANBERRA, 1 December 1946

MOST IMMEDIATE

Your UN845. [1]

Text referred to [2] not received even yet. Proposals in paragraph 13 regarding land laws, education and religious freedom were only contemplated as a last resort, and on condition that draft would be approved without any other changes. We would definitely prefer no change whatsoever. No other amendment except addition of a clause covering only educational advancement, land laws and religious freedom should be considered and in particular proposals in paragraphs 10 and 14 of your UN845 Assembly 287, are entirely unacceptable. In no circumstances can Government be bound by clauses unless there is prior approval. It is not possible to over-emphasise our definite preference for no change and necessity for specific approval of Government to any addition recommended as a last resort in obtaining approval.
