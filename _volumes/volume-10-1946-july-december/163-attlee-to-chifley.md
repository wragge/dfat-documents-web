# 163 Attlee to Chifley

Cablegram 339 LONDON, 15 October 1946, 7.06 a.m.

IMPORTANT SECRET AND PERSONAL

Thank you for your message in your telegram No.357. [1] I am very much alive to the difficulties which the Dutch-Indonesian situation has caused for Australia and I am therefore the more grateful to you and Dr. Evatt for your ready acceptance of our views. I feel sure that you can fully rely on Lord Killearn continuing to maintain closest touch with Mr. Ballard and I will certainly convey to him your offer of assistance so that he may take advantage of it should the occasion arise.
