# 137 Department of External Affairs to Ballard

Cablegram 114 CANBERRA, 26 September 1946

IMMEDIATE SECRET

Announcement will be released this evening 26th September regarding invitation [1] issued by Australian and New Zealand Governments to United States, United Kingdom, France and Netherlands Governments to attend Conference in Australia early next year. Purpose of conference will be to discuss establishment of Regional Advisory Commission for South and South-west Pacific Area, which would deal with questions of welfare and economic development but not defence and security or political matters.

Please note that territories to be included in activities of proposed Commission will be those 'lying generally south of the Equator and eastwards from New Guinea'. Only Dutch territory concerned therefore will be Dutch New Guinea.

This information may assist you in case of adverse reaction by Indonesians to our invitation to Dutch.
