# 64 Letter From Barwick To Tunku Abdul Rahman - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 29 April 1963

May I formally thank you and your Government for great kindness during my recent visit to Kuala Lumpur and to the Cameron Highlands.1 May I say how very much I enjoyed our conversations and I am sure thereby obtained a clearer insight into your own experienced views.

I am glad so much progress was made at Manila, a circumstance which I think is tremendously to the credit of your Government and its representative.2 I know there are many pitfalls in these talks but I feel sure that participation in them, and the exhibition of a reasonable though firm attitude, will do much towards ensuring that Malaysia comes into existence without open hostilities. Also it will reduce the strength of those who oppose Malaysia and perhaps ensure that they have no friends in the international community who can assist them to frustrate it either before its creation or afterwards.

1 Barwick made a two day visit to this hillstation north of Kuala Lumpur, 17–18 April, for talks with the Tunku and Lee Kuan Yew on the current situation in the development of Malaysia.
