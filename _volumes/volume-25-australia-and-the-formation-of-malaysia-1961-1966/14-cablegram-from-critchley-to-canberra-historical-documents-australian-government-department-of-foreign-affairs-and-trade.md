# 14 Cablegram from Critchley to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Kuala Lumpur, 17 December 1962

450\. Confidential

**Brunei Federation Relations with Indonesia**

Last night Tunku described Subandrio�s1 statement in Singapore (repeated in Djakarta) attacking him for his allegations that Indonesia was involved in the Brunei revolt2 as serious matter which would be discussed by Cabinet. He added that if any action was considered necessary, matter would be taken up through appropriate channels.

2\. Asked by the Tunku this morning about Subandrio�s statement I said it seemed that Subandrio might have wanted to provoke a reaction. If this were so I could only guess at implications but Indonesia might conceivably want to justify a stronger stand in United Nations against Malaysia and in support of Azahari. In any event it seems desirable to avoid hasty reply. If farther reply was necessary it could, perhaps, be limited to pointing out that Malayan accusations had been about interference by Indonesian parties and organisations and that it was unnecessary to say anything further because the organisations concerned were continuing publicly to support rebels. I also suggested that since the Indonesian statements appeared to be directed against the Tunku presently rather than against Malaya there could be advantage in having some of his colleagues reply to the Indonesians where necessary.

3\. The Tunku agreed. He said it was to avoid being drawn at this stage that he had announced that the matter would be discussed in Cabinet. This could mean anything and _no_ exception could be taken to it.

1 Dr Subandrio, Indonesia’s Second Deputy First Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Economic Relations.

2 In a statement to the Malayan Parliament on 11 December, the Tunku had accused the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and ‘other’ organisations of encouraging and supporting the revolt both financially and militarily. He had not implicated the Indonesian Government but the Indonesian press took his comments as ‘accusations’ against Indonesia and developed an anti-Malaysia campaign. In Singapore, on 15 December, Subandrio had spoken about the Tunku�s ‘hostile statements’ and accusations endangering Indonesian—Malayan relations, and on returning to Jakarta had added that Indonesia �would accept the Tunku�s challenge� if his slanderous remarks continued.
