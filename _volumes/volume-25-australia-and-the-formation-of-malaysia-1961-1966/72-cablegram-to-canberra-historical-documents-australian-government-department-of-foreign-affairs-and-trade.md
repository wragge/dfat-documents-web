Manila, 11 June 1963

402\. Unclassified

**Tripartite Talks**

Ministerial meeting concluded today with final statements by three participants. Following are operative paragraphs (2 to 9) of communique.

2\. The deliberations were held in a frank manner and in a most cordial atmosphere in keeping with the spirit of the accord reached among President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra of the Federation of Malaya, and President Macapagal of the Republic of the Philippines. This Ministerial conference was a manifestation of the determination of the nations in this region to achieve closer cooperation in their endeavour to chart a common future.

3\. The three Ministers examined the Philippine proposal embodying President Macapagal’s idea for the establishment of a confederation of nations of Malay origin and agreed on the acceptance of the idea as a means of bringing together their countries into the closest association. Initial steps were agreed upon by the Ministers in order to implement the proposal. For this purpose, they agreed to recommend to the forthcoming meeting of Heads of Government the establishment of machinery for regular consultations among their Governments at all levels of problems of common concern, such as security, stability, and economic, social and cultural development.

4\. The Ministers were of one mind that the three countries share a primary responsibility for the maintenance of the stability and security of the area from subversion in any form or manifestation in order to preserve their respective national identities, and to ensure the peaceful development of their respective countries and of their region, in accordance with the ideals and aspirations of their peoples.

5\. The three Ministers, in the context of their close and brotherly association, succeeded in reaching common understanding and complete agreement on how to resolve problems of common concern arising out of the proposal to establish a Federation of Malaysia.

6\. In the same brotherly spirit the three Ministers discussed the Philippine claim to North Borneo and arrived at a common understanding and agreement on how this problem should be resolved justly and expeditiously.

7\. The three Ministers also exchanged views regarding current problems mutually affecting their respective countries in the field of economic, social and cultural cooperation.

8\. The three Ministers have prepared a number of documents embodying their recommendations resulting from their deliberations which will be submitted to the meeting of the Heads of Government for their consideration and approval.1

9\. The Ministers recommended that a meeting of their respective Heads of Government be held in Manila not later than the end of July 1963.

Paragraphs 10 and 11 mutual congratulations and special tribute to President Macapagal’s ‘courage, vision and inspiration’.
