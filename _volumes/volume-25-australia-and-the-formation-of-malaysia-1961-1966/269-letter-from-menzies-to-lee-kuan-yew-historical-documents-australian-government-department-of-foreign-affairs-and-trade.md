# 269 Letter from Menzies to Lee Kuan Yew - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 18 May 1965

Personal Confidential

Thank you for your personal letter of April 20th, following up our valuable discussions during your recent visit.1

Perhaps I should make clear a few aspects of my own thinking.

I was, and am, impressed by your political analysis, and your belief that it is necessary to build a multi-racial Malaysia, with all that this concept involves. I deeply regret that there should be any personal conflict between yourself and the Tunku, whom I admire and respect, and whose place in Malaysian nationalism you yourself most fully acknowledge.

At a time when my own country and others are committed to military action in defence of Malaysia, I would not want to see any ‘disengagement’ which was more than very temporary, or which suggested disintegration. I would strongly counsel patience in this field. Reading your letter once more, I realise that there is much common ground. As an old Federalist myself, I feel that the non-representation of Singapore in Federal matters is not something we would wish to see continue indefinitely. I have told my colleague, Hasluck, to open this up with the Tunku in Kuala Lumpur; I will certainly pursue the matter with the Tunku in London.2

In your letter to me, you suggest ways and means of avoiding danger. These I think well worth the consideration of the Tunku, and I will tell him so in London. Meanwhile, it is important that I should play my part as a friend of both the Tunku and yourself, and not as a partisan.

I can assure you that I want to see, for all our sakes, a sensible and friendly settlement, which I am sure would make Malaysia a living and secure structure. Meanwhile, I urge patience as the constant companion of your unquestioned abilities. When I get to London, I shall bear in mind our discussion in Canberra about the possibility of your being available in London should fruitful talks appear probable.

I will not need to tell you that, if my own influence is to have significance, I must not form any judgments in advance and it must not be made to appear that I have done so.
