# 119 Letter from Tunku Abdul Rahman to Menzies - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Kuala Lumpur, 26 September 1963

Confidential

I was most heartened to receive an extract of the statement you made in Parliament on 25th September when in no uncertain manner you made the following remarks:

‘... that if, in the circumstances that now exist, there occurs, in relation to Malaysia or any of its constituent States, armed invasion or subversive activity—supported or directed or inspired from outside Malaysia, we shall to the best of our powers and by such means as shall be agreed upon with the Government of Malaysia, add our military assistance to the efforts of Malaysia and the United Kingdom in the defence of Malaysia’s territorial integrity and political independence....’1

This is immensely reassuring and the people and the Government of Malaysia are deeply appreciative of the gesture of friendship and the readiness of Australia to help us in time of need. This statement of yours has brought great relief to a worried people of Malaysia who on our own will be no match for a stronger enemy backed by their Communist allies. Your timely assurance of support has given us renewed strength and courage to carry out the necessary defence measures against our enemies from within and without and at the same time to continue with our economic development as planned. For this we are all grateful to you, the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Australia.
