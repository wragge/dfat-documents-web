# 299 Cablegram to Pritchett - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 10 August 1965

864\. Secret

**Singapore and Malaysia**

Please pass the following message from the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of Singapore.

Begins:

My dear Lee,

Thank you very much for your letter of yesterday. You and I have discussed in the past the many problems that were involved in making the Federation work, and I think, especially now that I have seen the details of the arrangement, I can understand the situation and the great personal stress that faced you at the week-end. Of course, there is disappointment to me in the separation of Singapore from the Federation. But that question is settled and the question in front of us is what we now do. I do not need to tell you that you will have our understanding and co-operation. You will have your own special concerns about trade and development and about maintaining the necessary outlets and markets with Malaysia and the rest of world. There is also the vital consideration that there should be no fracture of the substance of the present defence arrangements. We are looking to see what effect the new situation has on our defence arrangements and commitments. We want to continue to play our part, in association with Britain and New Zealand, in the defence of Singapore and Malaysia both. And since the defence of Malaysia and Singapore is inseparable, I welcome the fact that there are provisions in the Separation Agreement for continued defence co-operation between the two States and for joint defence machinery.

All these are matters that will involve consultations between us, and we shall be happy to establish diplomatic representation in Singapore at the level of High Commissioner. I am announcing today Australia’s recognition of the State of Singapore.

You have my best wishes in your new responsibilities and I look forward to working with you in continuation of the warm personal relations that already exist between us.1

With kind regards,

R.G. Menzies

Ends.

1 Lee Kuan Yew replied on 23 August that he was preoccupied with the ‘hazards’ facing Singapore and that he would write to Menzies ‘in a few weeks when there is no danger of any internal communal clash which can ruin Singapore’s international image’.
