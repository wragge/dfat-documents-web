Kuala Lumpur, 12 August 1965

I must apologize for not advising you beforehand that I would be taking this step to set up Singapore as an independent country. I was afraid then that if my intentions were to become known there would be trouble within the country and so I had to force a measure through as quickly as I could. I can assure you that the step which I have taken is a right one, bearing in mind the internal situation.

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew had planned for a break with the Central Government and had ingratiated into the favour of many Asian countries when he visited these countries recently. I had two avenues open to me, either to take repressive measures against him or do what I have done; i.e., a fitting way out of our critical situation.

We have now agreed to set up a Joint Council of Defence and arrangements to provide ‘the Singapore Government will afford[1](#f1) such assistance as may be considered reasonable and adequate for external defence. The Government of Singapore will afford the Government of Malaysia the right to continue to maintain base and the other facilities used by its military forces within Singapore’. It has also been agreed that either party would undertake not to enter into any agreement with any foreign country which agreement might prove detrimental to the independence and security of Malaysia.

We consider the arrangements we have made with Singapore adequate for our purpose as they preclude Singapore from entering into any relationship with any country which is unfriendly to Malaysia. On the other hand you may ask what if they were to do so; what course of action is then open to us. This, I may say, when our security and our freedom is in danger, is for us to decide what measures we will take to meet this situation.

I have given my fullest consideration to the implication of the action taken by my Government but I could not see any other way out. I would, therefore, request you to bear with us and it is needless for me to assure you that we shall always remain your good friend.

I propose to sponsor Singapore’s admission to the United Nations and also as a member of the Commonwealth and I hope you would be willing to give your support.

I have sent an identical message to the Prime Minister of Britain and of New Zealand.
