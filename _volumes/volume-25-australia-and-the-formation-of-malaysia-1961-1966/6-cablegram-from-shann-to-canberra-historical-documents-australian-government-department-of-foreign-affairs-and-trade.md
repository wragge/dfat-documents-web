# 6 Cablegram from Shann to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

London, 29 May 1962

2431\. Secret

**Malaysia**

I carried my discussion with Golds2 further this morning with Wallace3 at the Colonial Office. He was able to be a little more precise about timing, and suggested that if all went well the Cobbold report would be published this week, the Tunku would be here next month, a general blessing from the Tunku and the British Government would follow, coinciding with the release of the report, and that the question would then be considered in the late summer in the Borneo Legislatures (such as they are), and there would perhaps then be a conference in London of all the parties concerned which would set a time some time in 1963 for the coming into being of Malaysia. Wallace seems to have in mind for the latter a date perhaps earlier then August 1963.

2\. The Colonial Office perhaps is slightly less optimistic than the Commonwealth Relations Office about the chances of eventual success. They are encouraged by a marked change in favour of Malaysia in Borneo, which stems in part from the ill-advised activity of the Communists during the visit of the Cobbold Commission. Knowing that the British authorities must some day leave, the Borneans now see perhaps more clearly the need for something to take its place.

3\. Wallace confirmed that4 Golds had said about the main difficulties that lie in the way. Citizenship, in relation to what Lee Kwan Yew has agreed with the Tunku for Singapore,5 may be the main one, and Lee Kwan Yew is hoping that Borneo will get less than Singapore, although the achievement of this is unlikely. The kind of transition from British rule is a problem, and the Colonial Office too is worried that the Tunku may be inclined to accept more than his political strength in Malaya justified. This would be particularly so if he were to accept what the British regard as the most desirable outcome, which is that under a Malaysian cover the entire British administration, including Governors, should continue for some years.

4\. Wallace regards Lee Kwan Yew’s present attitude of relaxed confidence as justified, although he is worried by the extent of continued colonial rule in the Territories, as he feels that criticism he has met in Yugoslavia6 and elsewhere that he is condoning the continuance of imperialism may, in these circumstances, be difficult to answer. Lee Kwan Yew has also told the Colonial Office that he would not wish any further Communists to be locked up until after his referendum.7 But Wallace seems to have a clearer picture of when the referendum is likely to take place, which is November.

5\. I asked Wallace how the United Kingdom now felt about the question of defence. Were they satisfied that the kind of restrictions that we face on the movement of forces from Malaya itself would not be likely to be applied to Singapore? Wallace says that this would be most unlikely, and that the Defence authorities in England are satisfied that their freedom of action in Singapore will not be impaired. It is unlikely, however, that any attempt will be made to spell this out in legal documents, as this might only precipitate the situation which the Defence people faced in Nigeria.8 Lee Kwan Yew has again expressed the opinion in London that the United Kingdom forces should stay in Singapore.

6\. In general, Wallace feels that most responsible leaders in all of the Territories concerned, are now satisfied, as is Cobbold, that Malaysia would be a good thing in itself, and not just a neat way of tidying up British colonial responsibilities in the area. It is difficult for these people to see any practicable alternative, and the possibility of others, especially Indonesia, becoming interested before long is a factor.

1 Keith Charles Owen (‘Mick’) Shann, Senior External Affairs Officer, London.

2 Anthony Golds, Head, Far East and Pacific Department, Commonwealth Relations Office (CRO). Shann had met with Golds the previous day and discussed the progress of the Cobbold enquiry and of other issues relating to the proposed Federation of Malaysia.

3 W. Ian Wallace, Assistant Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.

4 Presumably, ‘what’.

5 The two had agreed that there would be one common citizenship�that of Malaysia.

6 A reference to the first conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Belgrade in September 1961.

7 A referendum to be held in Singapore to determine the terms under which Singapore would enter the Federation of Malaysia. Lee believed that the legitimacy of the Federation would be compromised if procommunist leaders, who opposed the merger, were locked up before the referendum.

8 The Anglo-Nigerian defence pact of 1960 had concentrated on mutual assistance, British training aid to the Nigerian military, and provision for staging and over-flying rights for the RAF. The pact had been approved by the Nigerian legislature upon independence in October 1960. However, there had been considerable opposition to it within Nigeria. In the face of growing public hostility, the pact had been abrogated in early 1962, though military aid continued as before and British officers still served in the Nigerian army.
