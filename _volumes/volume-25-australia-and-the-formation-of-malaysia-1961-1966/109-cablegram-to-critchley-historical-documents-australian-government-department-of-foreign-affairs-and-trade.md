# 109 Cablegram to Critchley - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 11 September 1963

644\. Secret Immediate

**Future Association with British–Malaysian Defence Treaty**

In answer to a question in the House yesterday, Prime Minister said a positive statement on this matter would be made before long.

2\. Please commence preliminary discussions with Malayan authorities on the text which follows below. You might explain to them that some statement in Parliament will be necessary, and that an early statement consequent upon the establishment of Malaysia will facilitate presentation of the matter as a routine adjustment.

3\. Text begins:

‘I have the honour to refer to my letter to the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, dated 24th March, 1959, and his reply of 21st April, 1959,1 concerning the presence of Australian forces in the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve under the Agreement on External Defence and Mutual Assistance between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Federation of Malaya on 12th October, 1957.

The Governments of the United Kingdom, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore have agreed by Article VI of an agreement concluded on 9th July, 1963, on the extension to all territories of Malaysia of the 1957 Agreement. The Government of Australia accordingly regards its association with the Agreement as henceforth applying to Malaysia. I should be grateful if you would confirm that this is your understanding of the position.’

Ends.

4\. We are repeating this telegram to Wellington, and asking the High Commissioner2 to explain that because [of] a time factor, we have authorised you to commence preliminary discussions with the Malayans on the basis of the text which we believe to be in line with New Zealand thinking.

We are giving the British High Commission the text.

_For Wellington_. Please take necessary action.
