# 307 Cabinet Decision No. 1123 - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 12 August 1965

Confidential

**Without Memorandum—Australian Relations with Singapore**

The Cabinet noted that Singapore, having separated from Malaysia and not being, as yet, a member of the Commonwealth in its own right, is strictly not eligible for treatment as a Commonwealth country and is outside the Sterling area and outside the schedule of countries entitled to preferential treatment under the Australian Tariff.

2\. It decided that by an administrative direction (if that is sufficient) or by statutory provision, the arrangements previously applying to relations with Singapore as part of the former Malaysia should be maintained until such time as the status of Singapore is determined and the new arrangements are worked out.1
