Jakarta, 9 June 1964

635\. Confidential

 **Malaysia-Indonesian Policy**

Present indications that the Indonesians are stepping up, rather than reducing, their activity in North Borneo,[1](#f1) underline the impression I have that Indonesia neither expects nor wishes a satisfactory outcome from a possible Summit. They must know (and perhaps want this) that increased border activity will mean that there will indeed be no Summit at all. Having had his little trip[2](#f2) Sukarno can then return in a state of outraged fury and go on with his policy of crushing Malaysia, somehow putting the ‘blame’ on the Tunku. Such a policy will suit both the P.K.I. and the Army. It will not be a pleasant prospect for us.

2\. This reading of the situation is reinforced by the relaxed attitude of the P.K.I. which is virtually ignoring preparations for a Summit in a way implying that it is unconcerned about the possible outcome. The Government’s public presentation of its policy is also revealing. The controversial final paragraph of the agreed Tripartite statement was evidently included by Indonesia for domestic political reasons since thereby the Government appeared not to have altered its previous stand on withdrawal. At the same time, the fact that Sukarno in Manila has agreed to drop the paragraph has been practically ignored here by the press.[3](#f3) From the bellicose temper of statements on Malaysia which continue to be issued here by secondary leaders, it would appear that a general instruction has not yet been issued to prepare the way for public acceptance [of a] change of policy on Malaysia.

1 For example, on 1 June, _Antara_ had reported that two battalions of Volunteers’ Auxiliary Combat Brigade had left Jakarta for the Malaysian border, and that volunteer troops from Central Java would also soon be leaving for the frontier.

2 Sukarno had departed for Tokyo on 5 June, first visiting Manila, 6-7 June, where he and Subandrio had discussions with Macapagal and Lopez. (It was anticipated that tripartite ministerial talks would begin in Tokyo on 13 June, followed by a summit on 15-16 June.)
