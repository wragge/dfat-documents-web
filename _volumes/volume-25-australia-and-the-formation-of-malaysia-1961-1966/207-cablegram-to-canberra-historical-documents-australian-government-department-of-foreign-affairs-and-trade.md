# 207 Cablegram to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

New York, 13 September 1964

UN896. Confidential Priority

**Malaysia**

Americans have suggested a resolution which after relatively minor modifications by Malaysians reads as follows—

‘Having considered the complaint of the Government of Malaysia as contained in document....1

Having heard the statements of the representatives of Malaysia and Indonesia:—

1\. Deplores the resort to force which has been taking place in the settlement of differences between members of the United Nations in contravention of both the Charter of the United Nations and the Bandung Declaration,2

2\. Calls for an immediate termination of armed actions violating the territorial integrity and threatening the independence of a member state of the United Nations,

3\. Requests the Secretary General at the invitation of either party, to provide observers to ascertain that armed actions against its own territory have in fact ceased,

4\. Expresses the hope that with the abandonment of the resort to force a new climate will be created in which the two parties with the assistance of the Secretary General will be able to seek the re-establishment of friendly and neighbourly relations with one another.’

2\. Malaysians intend to tell Americans that this resolution would be acceptable and to ask them to do what they can to have it tabled and supported in the Council.

3\. 

In the meantime the Malaysians have agreed with the British that the following resolution would be acceptable—

‘Having considered the complaint of the Government of Malaysia as contained in documents....3

Having heard the statements of the parties concerned and other statements during the debate on this question,

Deeply concerned about the deteriorating relations between Malaysia and Indonesia,

Noting the desire of both parties to continue their talks,

Recalling that all members of this organisation have undertaken to act in accordance with the principle among others that they will refrain in their international relations from the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations as set forth in Article 2(4) of the Charter:—

1\. Deplores the incident of 2 September 1964.4

2\. Calls upon the parties to cease forthwith all threat or use of force and to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of each other, so as to create the conducive atmosphere for the continuance of their talks.

3\. Requests the Secretary General to keep the situation under review and report to the Council within three months from today.’

4\. Ismail explains this draft as representing the minimum that would be acceptable. We have the impression that the Malaysians may have already given some other delegations an idea of what they could accept.

5\. Critchley, who was shown both resolutions, had some reservations about the Malaysian draft and saw more merit in the American draft. He also pointed out the advantage of having the Americans as closely associated as possible with the draft submitted. At his suggestion Malaysians will ask Americans to give their draft a run before seeking further support for their own.
