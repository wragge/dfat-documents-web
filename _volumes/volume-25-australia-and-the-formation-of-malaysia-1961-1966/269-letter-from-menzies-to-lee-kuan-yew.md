Canberra, 18 May 1965

Personal Confidential

Thank you for your personal letter of April 20th, following up our valuable discussions during your recent visit.[1](#f1)

Perhaps I should make clear a few aspects of my own thinking.

I was, and am, impressed by your political analysis, and your belief that it is necessary to build a multi-racial Malaysia, with all that this concept involves. I deeply regret that there should be any personal conflict between yourself and the Tunku, whom I admire and respect, and whose place in Malaysian nationalism you yourself most fully acknowledge.

At a time when my own country and others are committed to military action in defence of Malaysia, I would not want to see any ‘disengagement’ which was more than very temporary, or which suggested disintegration. I would strongly counsel patience in this field. Reading your letter once more, I realise that there is much common ground. As an old Federalist myself, I feel that the non-representation of Singapore in Federal matters is not something we would wish to see continue indefinitely. I have told my colleague, Hasluck, to open this up with the Tunku in Kuala Lumpur; I will certainly pursue the matter with the Tunku in London.[2](#f2)

In your letter to me, you suggest ways and means of avoiding danger. These I think well worth the consideration of the Tunku, and I will tell him so in London. Meanwhile, it is important that I should play my part as a friend of both the Tunku and yourself, and not as a partisan.

I can assure you that I want to see, for all our sakes, a sensible and friendly settlement, which I am sure would make Malaysia a living and secure structure. Meanwhile, I urge patience as the constant companion of your unquestioned abilities. When I get to London, I shall bear in mind our discussion in Canberra about the possibility of your being available in London should fruitful talks appear probable.

I will not need to tell you that, if my own influence is to have significance, I must not form any judgments in advance and it must not be made to appear that I have done so.
