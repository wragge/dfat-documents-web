# 93 Cablegram From Barwick To Cutts - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 29 July 1963

448\. Confidential Immediate

Please pass the following message to Dr. Subandrio from Barwick:

‘I was naturally glad to learn that the Manila Summit will take place as planned and profoundly hope the meeting will be successful. As you know, I have always been conscious of Indonesia�s position about Malaysia and welcome the resolutions of the Manila conference as a step towards harmonising different views. Australia believes that Malaysia would be in no way inconsistent with a strong, united and prosperous Indonesia. Indeed I am convinced that Malaysia is in the best interests of us all. Equally, I believe that close and friendly co-operation between the three Malay nations, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaya, is essential to the peace of the area.’

2\. Please pass the following message to S.L. Lopez, Foreign Minister, from Barwick:

‘I send you my best wishes for the success of the Manila Summit. The Philippine Government has an historic role to play on this occasion. If as a result of the meeting close co-operation between the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaya can be achieved it will be an occasion which future generations will mark as a turning point in the affairs of the region.’

3\. Please pass following message to Tunku Abdul Rahman from Barwick:

‘We are following the forthcoming negotiations with deepest anxiety. So much depends on the success or failure of the meeting. If you succeed, there is a good opportunity of close and fruitful co-operation between the three Malay nations which will contribute immeasurably to the strength and stability of our region.

The alternative is a long period to tension, hostility and suspicion. I feel the meeting is something which calls for all the highest qualities of statesmanship, flexibility, restraint and a determination to succeed in spite of formidable difficulties.

My best wishes go with you.’
