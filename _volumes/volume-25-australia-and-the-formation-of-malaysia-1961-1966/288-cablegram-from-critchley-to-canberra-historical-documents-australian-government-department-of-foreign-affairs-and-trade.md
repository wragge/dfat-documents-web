# 288 Cablegram from Critchley to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Kuala Lumpur, 9 August 1965

1710\. Secret Emergency

Following meeting of Alliance Council this afternoon (8th August) Tunku told Head that the Alliance Government has decided and would announce tomorrow the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Meeting was at Head’s initiative and it is uncertain if otherwise British would have learnt of decision in advance.

2\. British believe Lee Kuan Yew knows and has accepted. Passing through Kuala Lumpur a week ago Lee told me that he was going to the Cameron Highlands1 to prepare for Parliament session beginning tomorrow, but British say his present whereabouts are not known. They assume that the Tunku has spoken to him since his return.

3\. Head pointed out to the Tunku the serious implications for Malaysia’s allies as well as the encouragement it would give Indonesia. He pleaded for at least a 24 hour delay to give the British Government time to consider its position. Tunku refused.

4\. Head in reporting to London has suggested that he should only say in answer to press enquiries that:—

(a) British Government was informed in advance.

(b) That implications are being studied.

5\. No other details are known and it is doubtful if any detailed consideration has been given to relations between Malaysia and Singapore including defence agreements, economic arrangements and internal security.

6\. I presume bill to give effect to this decision will be introduced in Parliament tomorrow.
