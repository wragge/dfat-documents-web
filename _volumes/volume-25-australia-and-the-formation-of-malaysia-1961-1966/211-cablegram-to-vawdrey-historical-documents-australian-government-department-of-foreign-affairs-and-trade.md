# 211 Cablegram to Vawdrey - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 19 September 1964

887\. Top Secret Immediate

Please pass the following message from the Prime Minister to the Malaysian Prime Minister:

Begins:

Please accept my warm congratulations on your resounding success in the Security Council despite Russian obstruction. It is clear that you selected just the right occasion for placing the question of Indonesian aggression against Malaysia before the Security Council. I accept the force of your view in your letter to our Acting High Commissioner, a copy of which I have just seen, that any retaliatory action against Indonesia should be closely related to the nature and seriousness of any Indonesian action.2

I look forward to our continuing association with you in your consolidation of international opinion and use of international processes and, at the same time, maintaining the demonstration of military readiness and firmness as a deterrent.

Ends.
