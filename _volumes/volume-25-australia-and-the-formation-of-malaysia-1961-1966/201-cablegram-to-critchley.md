Canberra, 5 September 1964

840\. Secret Immediate

Ministers have authorised you to convey assurance to Malaysian Government in following terms—

Begins:

The Australian Government agrees in principle that after the taking of the question of Indonesian attacks on Malayan territory to the Security Council, the defensive measures to be taken in the event of any further act of aggression by Indonesia upon the territory of Malaya or Singapore should include such operations as may be found necessary against appropriate objectives on Indonesian territory.

Ends.

2\. In conveying this to the Tunku, please emphasise that we would _not_ wish Malaysian Government to allude in any way publicly to this assurance without consulting us. Head has been instructed to speak to Tunku in similar terms.
