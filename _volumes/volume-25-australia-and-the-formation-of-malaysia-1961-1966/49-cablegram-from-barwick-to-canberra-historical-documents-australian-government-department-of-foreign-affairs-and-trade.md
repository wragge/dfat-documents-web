# 49 Cablegram from Barwick to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Manila, 12 March 1963

182\. Confidential

I had a long talk with Pelaez, Macapagal,1 and Subandrio (record will follow)2 and am alarmed at Tunku’s latest outburst.3 Have made clear that I do not regard Malaysia as negotiable, but personally see merit in the conference proposed by the Filipinos (our 174)4 with a view to removing intra-Malay discord and to reduce hostility to Malaysia. Would like Critchley’s urgent reaction to my thought that Tunku should desist from the public course he is taking and indicate his willingness to join in talks at which he might:—

(a) without negotiating with Malaysia, proffer an exposition of proposals,

(b) offer assurance of non-interference, overtly or covertly, in Indonesian affairs, particularly in relation to Sumatra,

(c) indicate his willingness to discuss generally further co-operation between the Malayan people of the area, and

(d) indicate his willingness after Malaysia to accept submission of Philippines’ claims to the International Court of Justice provided, in the event of its success, a referendum be taken.

2\. Meantime, Tunku at least to stop broadcasting by Des Alwi and I think, if possible, move Sumitro out of Malaya. I am convinced that some gesture towards Indonesia along these lines is becoming indispensable if Indonesian hostility is to abate.

3\. Will cable further thoughts after further interview with Subandrio tomorrow.
