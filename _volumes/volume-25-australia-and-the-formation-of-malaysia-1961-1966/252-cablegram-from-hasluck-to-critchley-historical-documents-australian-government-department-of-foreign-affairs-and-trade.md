# 252 Cablegram from Hasluck to Critchley - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 25 February 1965

322\. Secret

Reference your telegrams Nos. 474,1 4752 and 481.3

The Department is examining the possible Indonesian motivation in suggesting a Ministerial meeting between Malaysia and Indonesia in Bangkok early next month. However, it seems apparent that it is a political manoeuvre and does not indicate any change in Indonesia’s policy of bringing about the disintegration of Malaysia. We have seen no evidence in the recent internal situation in Indonesia nor in Subandrio’s external activities which would support a more hopeful view. You were right to inject a note of caution at the meeting between Ministers and High Commissioners on the subject of another ascertainment. My views on the objections to this idea remain as stated in telegram No. 977 of 9th October last.4

3\. We do not know why Subandrio is now preferring direct initial talks between Indonesia and Malaysia as distinct from approaches by Japan and Pakistan.5 You may be right in saying that Subandrio may not have confidence in Japan and Pakistan. But an explanation might be that Subandrio believes that initial bilateral talks would clear the way for the establishment of an Afro-Asian Commission including Pakistan and Japan. Then in a meeting of four Afro-Asian powers together with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines it seems to us conceivable that a majority could be found in favour of some new act of re-ascertainment. Moreover, we doubt whether U Thant would use his influence against it as he has said that Indonesia’s withdrawal has been the United Nations worst blow.

4\. It seems to me that Malaysia is deluded if it thinks an Afro-Asian Commission will offer Indonesia prospects of face-saving without bringing other risks to Malaysia. The Malaysians should think very carefully about the circumstances in which they would agree to the establishment of a Commission and about its membership.

5 Subandrio had previously agreed to Japan and Pakistan acting separately to gain Malaysian agreement to a meeting of four Afro-Asian powers with the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to seek a resolution of the problem.
