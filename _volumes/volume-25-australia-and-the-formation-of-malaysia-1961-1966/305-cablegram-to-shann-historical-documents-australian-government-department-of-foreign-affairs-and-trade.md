# 305 Cablegram to Shann - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 12 August 1965

810\. Secret Immediate

Your talk with Dr Subandrio (your 940).1

It would be better for you to avoid expressing views about Indonesia recognizing Singapore quickly. We noticed the context of your remarks, but there is the risk that Subandrio might read into your view more than you intended, that he might twist publicly what you have said, and that other Governments might misinterpret the position.

2\. If Indonesia were to recognize Singapore quickly and end all confrontation with it, several possibilities could flow which could cause trouble for us. For example there could be demands in Malaysia for the same thing leading to the undermining of present policies. Again it could help Indonesia to detach Singapore from support of Malaysia in standing up to Indonesia’s policy of confrontation. By putting Singapore and Malaysia on a different basis as far as recognition by Indonesia is concerned it might work in the direction of having Singapore admitted to the next Afro-Asian Conference while Malaysia was still excluded. It could well be in Indonesia’s interests to take such steps and then return to confrontation after a period of time if it suited her.

3\. You will see the number of considerations that have to be weighed in the balance.
