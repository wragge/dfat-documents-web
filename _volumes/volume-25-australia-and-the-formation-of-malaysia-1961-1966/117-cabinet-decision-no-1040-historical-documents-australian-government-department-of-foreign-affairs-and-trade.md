# 117 Cabinet Decision No. 1040 - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 24 September 1963

Secret

**Without Memorandum—Australia’s Defence Association with Malaysia**

The Cabinet discussed the substance and the form of the statement to be made to Parliament on the subject of Australia’s defence association with Malaysia.

2\. It was agreed that the Government should use the occasion of the statement to make it clear, within Australia, to the Parliament and the people, and also outside Australia, that Australia is resolved to add its assistance to the efforts of Malaysia and the United Kingdom and others in the defence of Malaysia’s territorial integrity and political independence.

3\. The Cabinet confirmed that its consideration of this subject and the conclusions indicated above, were in the context that the Australian participation in Malaysia is in support of Britain’s and Malaysia’s own effort, and that whatever Australia does is to be in addition to that effort, and not in substitution.

4\. The Cabinet noted, in reaching its conclusion, a report by the Minister for Defence1 indicating that Australia would, if necessity arose, be in a position to make forces available to meet insurgency situations in Sabah and Sarawak from the Strategic Reserve or, alternatively, from within Australia.

5\. It was agreed that the statement would be made on behalf of the Government by the Prime Minister—probably on Wednesday, 25th September.2 Certain documents recording British and Australian defence association with Malaya in the first place, and later Malaysia, will be tabled.3
