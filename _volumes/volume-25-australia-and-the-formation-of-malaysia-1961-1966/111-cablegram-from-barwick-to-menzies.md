Jakarta, 14 September 1963

825\. Secret Immediate

Saw Sukarno this morning, Shann and Subandrio in attendance.[1](#f1) I thought him in noticeably declining health. I had already seen a summary of Michelmore’s findings (from British).[2](#f2) Although uncertain, I doubt if the Indonesians had received the report or a summary. No one on either side betrayed a knowledge of it. The interview was cordial enough but some of its exchanges were tough. A full note will go by bag. I put our interest in, and point of view on, Malaysia firmly and unmistakeably. I asked Sukarno what would be his attitude if U Thant reported favourably. He said he would accept U Thant’s report if Michelmore had conducted his enquiry according to the Manila Agreement, by which he stood. But he said he knew Michelmore had not seen all the detainees to ascertain their views. He said he would take his stand on this. No amount of argument that the Agreement did not require Michelmore to see them all could move him. I told him that if he followed this course, Australia, and for that matter a great number of nations, would conclude that Indonesia had not been bona fide at any point in relation to Malaysia and that this, coupled with the continued Indonesian training of subvertees, brought Australia’s goodwill, to say the least, into jeopardy not merely in the short run but in the long term. I emphasised Australia’s great and economical strength and its interest and importance in the region. He was quite stubborn. He accepted that we would stand with Malaysia and Great Britain and that America would do likewise, but Indonesia would ‘take it all’, meaning, take whatever was coming. Subandrio was more inclined to put off any definitive statement until U Thant’s report was published. Though I left them in no doubt as to where we stood, Sukarno remained obdurate in the attitude I have described. Unless the unequivocal strength of U Thant’s report or the pressures of the Americans and ourselves (the British having no influence here) during these few days cause him to change his mind, we are in for continuing trouble. He is in a determinedly irrational mood.
