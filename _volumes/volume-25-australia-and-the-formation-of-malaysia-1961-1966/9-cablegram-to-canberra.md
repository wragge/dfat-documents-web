Singapore, 4 September 1962

193\. Confidential

 **Singapore Referendum[1](#f1)**

Although somewhat loaded, referendum questions and complete Government control of propaganda machinery leave some doubt whether the people of Singapore genuinely accepted that merger proposals represent the best arrangement for Singapore or were badgered into choosing least objectionable of three alternatives. Large majority for proposals has, nevertheless, been received with considerable satisfaction.[2](#f2) Realism and common sense of Chinese Community as shown by comparatively small total blank votes, in spite of intense grass roots campaign by Barisan Socialists,[3](#f3) is regarded as particularly gratifying. Result is vindication of Lees’ decision to submit merger proposals to popular vote in spite of misgivings of Advisors including British Commission.[4](#f4) Lees’ ability to cope with extreme left has also been demonstrated. Possibility of Barisan Socialists mustering sufficient support for further major effort to block merger now appears remote (although it cannot be entirely discontinued) and party is likely to concentrate on planning strategy for post-Malaysia period (also will P.A.P ).

2\. Whether Singapore vote will have effect on North Borneo situation is uncertain. There is some hope, however, that a large majority for merger on terms which will leave control of Central Government in immediate future in Malayan hands may help to contract opposition to Malaysia for Borneo groups suspicious of effects of Malay domination.

[NAA: A1945, 162/4/4]

1 The referendum was held on 1 September.

2 Official results showed that 90 per cent of the electorate voted—71 per cent for the government’s negotiated position that ‘Singapore will be a state within the Federation but on special conditions (education and labour to be reserved) and with a large measure of local autonomy’; just over 25 per cent against this option; and around 14 per cent invalid.

3 The Barisan Socialis (‘Socialist Front’) party formed by the pro-communist members of the government who defected from the PAP following the Anson by-election in July 1961.

4 For example, Philip Moore, UK Deputy Commissioner in Singapore. In order to counter any communist call for a blank vote on the merger, Lee had inserted a clause in the Referendum Bill that recommended that blank ballot papers would indicate that the voters concerned did not wish to exercise their right to decide for or against merger themselves. The decision would then be taken by the majority in the Assembly—the promerger PAP. Moore had been concerned that the people’s choice to express their opposition to the merger and the referendum by casting a blank vote had been eliminated, and that the referendum would be labelled false and dishonest.
