# 59 Cablegram From Critchley To Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Kuala Lumpur, 29 March 1963

217\. Secret

**Malaysia**

Concern referred to in your telegram 2391 exists among some officials in Ministry of External Affairs but I have found no evidence of it at government level.

2\. Tunku told me last night that he was not worried about Australia�s attitude on defence. No further assurances about our intentions or obligations were required and the less said the better. He knew Australia and Australians and was confident of our friendship and support in emergency.

1 28 March. It informed Critchley of a report from the Malayan High Commission in Canberra that there was concern in Kuala Lumpur about whether Australia�s desire for friendship with Indonesia meant that Australia�s support for Malaysia would not include being prepared to defend the federation in the event of conflict.
