# 229 Record of Conversation Between Tange and Tun Lim Yew Hock - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 30 December 1964

Secret

In the course of a call by the Malaysian High Commissioner on another matter, the Secretary referred to reports which we had received about a build-up of Indonesian forces in Kalimantan. We did not expect any immediate trouble; it would take some time for the build-up of men and logistics to be completed. No doubt the British were discussing this with the Malaysian Government. In the meantime, the fruitless raids across the Malaysian Straits were continuing, as well as minor raids in the Borneo area—about which there was no publicity.

2\. The Secretary asked about the attitudes of the people in Malaysia—in Johore and Singapore—towards the recent Indonesian raids. Tun Lim replied that the raids so far had been ineffective and had aroused no fear among the local people. Ironical though it might be, the raids were having the effect of bringing the Chinese and Malaysians together rather than sharpening divisions between them.

3\. Tun Lim suggested that if there were to be an increase in confrontation in the New Year, this might lead to mediation by a third country. The Secretary warned that mediation, after a series of aggressive acts by Indonesians, could well be interpreted as vindicating Subandrio’s policies.

4\. The High Commissioner also referred to reported remarks by the Indonesian Ambassador that a meeting should be held between Sir Robert Menzies and President Sukarno. The Secretary said that he had been told that the Indonesian Ambassador had not himself put forward such a proposal but had rather answered a question about such a meeting in the affirmative.1 On the instructions of the Prime Minister, there had been no Australian reaction.

1 The report came from an ABC Radio news item broadcast, 23 December, covering the first news conference of the new Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, Major General R.A. Kosasih. The Major General had presented his credentials on 21 December.
