# 333 Cablegram from Pritchett to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Singapore, 23 September 1965

895\. Secret

During my talk with Goh on Tuesday (my 884)1 he expressed much impatience with Lee’s behaviour and said he had rebuked him severely for his Hokkien interview.2 This sort of thing had to stop. I reminded him of his earlier statements to me and my scepticism that Lee would stop politicking and Goh repeated that he would stop him. He said Lee was ‘contrite’ about the interview and that Lee’s remarks had been unfavourably received except by uneducated people.

2\. Goh took a strong line in opposition to Lee regarding relations with Kuala Lumpur and said co-operation and friendship were the only rational course. All the trouble was simply ‘man made’. There was nothing between the two that need cause conflict. Everything was settling down well. I spoke of the economic situation and emphasised the need for early progress with Kuala Lumpur. Goh expressed exasperation and said he would soon go to Kuala Lumpur and fix everything up with Razak. The present nonsense had to stop.

3\. On the defence agreement Goh said he still had nothing to say and was still waiting on the British. When I reminded him that Rob3 had some weeks ago given a note to Lee that put it on Singapore to approach the British about the new situation, he resisted this and finally said that, if so, the Prime Minister had not passed the note to him. Sundry comments indicated that Goh will be very demanding on points of details particularly on whittling down service prerogatives and in securing the most rewarding terms for Singapore. He said nothing on basic policy and since he has repeatedly said this will be alright I did not press him. (You will have seen how everything points to Singapore’s seeking a substantive position regarding the use of the bases, but there has been nothing to indicate this will of itself significantly restrict the use of the bases).

4\. Goh returned to his theme of Australia’s great debt to Singapore for securing the bases and gaining acceptance for them among the Afro-Asians and asked where was the quid pro quo. He has not yet indicated any precise demands but we can certainly expect pressure for military aid and economic trade support.

5\. I might note that in all my conversations with him, Goh’s comments clearly assume a substantial body of common interest between Australia and Singapore and the development of close relations in several fields.

6\. Goh spoke very freely to me. Would you please ensure he is fully protected and his remarks not circulated.
