# 81 Cablegram To Eastman - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 5 July 1963

2608\. Confidential Immediate

**Malaysia**

Reference your telegram No. 3343.1

We have assumed throughout that the British would be uncompromising in the view that they could not entertain an agreement on Malaysia which excluded Singapore. Please advise urgently whether they are likely to make any departure from this policy in the light of instructions going to Razak from Federation Government.2 Our own view remains as stated in our telegram No. 5169 of 6th May.3 This was that Australia would obviously be placed in a difficult position over a Malaysia which did not include Singapore. Our support for Malaysia as the best solution available has rested essentially on the proposition that Malaysia makes provision for the future of Singapore.

It would take very persuasive arguments to cause us to alter that view, including a high degree of probability that a step by step establishment of Malaysia would lead to Singapore’s early inclusion.

1 4 July. It reported a CRO account of the difficulties being experienced in London during the final negotiations on financial arrangements between Malaya and Singapore. The main obstacle was seen as being the Tunku’s frequent instructions to the Malayan delegation ‘forcing [them] to give nothing away and make endless “ nit-picking” objections to every proposal’.

2 The Tunku claimed that there was little more that he could concede, and if the current negotiations were not decisive, ‘Malaysia would have to be given up at least for the time being’.

3 Cablegram number incorrectly transcribed. Should read No. 1569.
