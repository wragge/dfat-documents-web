# 67 Cablegram To Kuala Lumpur - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 6 May 1963

339\. Secret

**Malaysia**

Your telegram No. 278.1

We are not clear whether Malayans� proposal for proceeding with Malaysia without Singapore is mainly a tactical device to put pressure on Singapore for a settlement. If so, we should be interested in yours and Singapore’s comments whether Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues might not be in the mood to defy the Federation threats. Our feeling is that Lee in the absence of a political understanding with the Tunku has, for some time, been determined that the Federation authorities should be made to appreciate his strength. Is there not the risk in this that the Malayans may have to back down or force a serious crisis?

2\. We, in Australia, would obviously be placed in a difficult position over a Malaysia which did not include Singapore. Our support for Malaysia as the best solution available has rested essentially on the proposition that Malaysia makes provision for the future of Singapore. We have explained our support in these terms to Indonesia and the Philippines. We would assume also that the British would have much greater difficulty in maintaining the necessary effort in the Borneo territories on behalf of a Malaysia which did not meet their primary initial purposes. Glad of your further comment.
