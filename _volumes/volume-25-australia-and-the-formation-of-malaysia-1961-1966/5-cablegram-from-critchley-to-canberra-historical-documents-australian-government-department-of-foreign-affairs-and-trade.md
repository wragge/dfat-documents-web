# 5 Cablegram from Critchley to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Kuala Lumpur, 10 May 1962

197.Secret

The Tunku did not state categorically in House3 that ‘deadline’ for Malaysia was August _1962_ but nevertheless this is his hope. He said Singapore would have to decide on merger by August or he would consider closing causeway.4 He had said earlier (our telegram 173)5 that he would go to London _before_ August for ‘final talks’ on Malaysia and Minister for Transport (Sardon)6did say in House on 2nd May ‘we hope to have Malaysia by 31st August’.

2\. Malayans take an optimistic view of Borneo developments. They have always tended to assume that the Cobbold report will be favourable and although constitutional changes may take some time that they will be in a position to proclaim Malaysia on Merdeka Day.7

3\. Tunku’s statement reflects continuing Malayan anxiety about Singapore. There is an increasing tendency to consider that the threat of Communist subversion must be dealt with firmly as a precondition for merger. At the weekend Razak8 told me that with the Cobbold Commission’s report on the way, the proposal for incorporating the Borneo territories had gained a momentum that would be difficult to stop. He thought that this progress need not be influenced by delay over Singapore.
