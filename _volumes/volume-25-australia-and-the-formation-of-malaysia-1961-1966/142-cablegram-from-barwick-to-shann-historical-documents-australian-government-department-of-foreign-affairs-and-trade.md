# 142 Cablegram from Barwick to Shann - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 30 December 1963

1477\. Secret Immediate

Please pass the following message to Subandrio from me and inform him at the same time that I have asked you to speak in the same sense to General Nasution.

Begins:

1\. I have watched with grave concern the continuation of Indonesia’s policy of confrontation against Malaysia, a policy which in my view cannot fail to do lasting damage to the peace of this region and which in all my efforts prior to September 16th, I strove to avert. I have avoided public expression of my abhorrence of the present situation but I should be less than candid if, because of the absence of public statements, I left you under any misapprehension as to the strength of Australia’s feelings. I am sending you this message by our Ambassador so that you should be in no doubt whatever as to where we stand in this matter.

2\. You will recall that on 25th September, 1963, our Prime Minister told the Australian Parliament that ‘if in the circumstances that now exist, there occurs in relation to Malaysia or any of its constituent States, armed invasion or subversive activity—supported or directed or inspired from outside Malaysia—we shall to the best of our powers and by such means as shall be agreed upon with the Government of Malaysia add our military assistance to the efforts of Malaysia and the United Kingdom’. At the recent elections, the Government received an overwhelming endorsement of its policy in this respect.

3\. This pledge still holds good. I most earnestly ask that before you take or counsel any action which might lead to a further deterioration of the position, you keep in mind that such a step must inevitably lead to an increased active involvement of Australian forces in the defence of Malaysia. This could have incalculable consequences for both nations and could scarcely fail to involve others. Our destiny should be to live as friendly neighbours in mutual co-operation. I have always hoped that we could do this and I still retain this hope. But if we are forced on to a collision course by a continuation of Indonesian confrontation of Malaysia we shall honour our obligations to the full and perform our assurances.

4\. You should know that the Australian Government has already provided military support for the defence of Malaysia. I am sure that you are aware, therefore, that the prolongation of the present situation must carry the ever-present risk of a clash of arms with all the consequences which must flow from such a development.

5\. You told Ambassador Shann that we understand each other1 and I hope that this is so. But in order that there should be no misunderstanding, I am sending you this further personal message.

6\. I have asked the Ambassador, after he has spoken to you, to seek an interview with your colleague, the Minister for Defence, and speak in the same sense.

Ends.

7\. After giving Subandrio this message, please speak at your discretion on the following lines. It gives Australia no pleasure to see the present deterioration of the economic situation in Indonesia. Indonesia with its large population and proximity to Australia is a logical trading partner for us. Our export capacity is mounting rapidly and we should like to see Indonesian prosperity rising in the same way. Instead, it is declining and the efforts which Subandrio is making to overcome the economic results of confrontation, although they have met with some success, are not sufficient to check the downward trend in the economy which is likely to continue if not accelerate so long as confrontation continues.

1 On 24 October, Shann had reported comments made by Subandrio on the government and the forthcoming Australian federal election. He noted: Subandrio ‘made a graceful remark about your own political future, expressing the hope that it was clear, as he liked the way you operated and felt you understood him. I guess you do too!’
