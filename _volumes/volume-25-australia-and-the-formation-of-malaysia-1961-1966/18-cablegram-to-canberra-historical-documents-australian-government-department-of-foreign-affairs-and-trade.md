# 18 Cablegram to Canberra - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Jakarta, 21 January 1963

51\. Unclassified

On 21st January ‘Antara’1 reported Dr. Subandrio as having said on 20th January in Djogjakarta2 that Indonesia cannot but adopt a policy of confrontation against Malaya because at present they represent themselves as accomplices of Neo-Colonialists and Neo-Imperialists pursuing a hostile policy towards Indonesia. It was regrettable, Subandrio reportedly said, that we have to adopt such a policy towards our neighbour Malaya whom we always regarded as friend and brother, but our patience towards Malaya has its limits.

‘Antara’ reported that Dr. Subandrio, whose speech was warmly supported by the enthusiastic students as he vehemently attacked the Imperialists, Colonialists, and their Lackeys, said that Indonesia had always adopted a policy of confrontation against Imperialism and Colonialism in all its forms.

It is now with great regret that we have to apply it to Malaya. This did not mean Indonesia was entering war with Malaya for confrontation could be carried out without a war.
