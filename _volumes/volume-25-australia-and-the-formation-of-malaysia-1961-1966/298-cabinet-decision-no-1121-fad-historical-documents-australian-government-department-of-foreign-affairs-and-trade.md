# 298 Cabinet Decision No. 1121 (fad) - Historical Documents - Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

Canberra, 10 August 1965

Secret

**Without Memorandum—Malaysia/Singapore Separation**

The Committee noted the separation arrangements announced on and given effect from 9th August. It noted, with regret, that the event of separation had occurred without prior discussion with or notice to Australia—or Britain or New Zealand—by Malaysia or Singapore, notwithstanding the close relationships, including the defence relationships, which these Governments had with the Federation of Malaysia. It noted also the personal messages sent independently to Tunku Abdul Rahman by the Prime Minister of each of the three countries, though without avail, in the hope of securing postponement.

2\. The Committee took the view, however, that although the separation must be greatly regretted and must be understood to give rise to a series of dangers for Malaysia and Singapore over the years ahead, the sensible and practical course for Australia now is to direct itself to the results of separation. This will involve not indulging in gloom, exhibiting goodwill to each of the entities, maintaining good relations with each and working with other countries to assist Malaysia and Singapore to make the separation a new beginning in the task of living together and developing their strength and common interests.

3\. On the question of co-operation between the two countries, the Committee noted with satisfaction the intention, as expressed in the Separation Agreement, to work together in various fields, including defence and economic affairs.

4\. The Committee gave particular attention to the continuation of defence arrangements for the area. It emphasized that great importance attaches to the early creation of the Joint Defence Council referred to in the Separation Agreement, and to its effective operation. It agreed that each country should be left in no doubt of the basic significance of a successful common defence effort and that the Governments and peoples of Malaysia and Singapore, the Australian people, and also the Indonesian authorities, should not be allowed the impression that the defence of the area against aggression would be likely to collapse.

5\. The Committee recognized that the prime responsibility for assistance to Malaysia and Singapore in their defence must, as before, remain with Britain, and that such intention as Australia expresses to maintain its defence assistance should be on the understanding that the British responsibility and contribution will continue undiminished. A view to this effect should be conveyed to the British Government.

6\. The Committee noted that the new State of Singapore had been recognized by Britain and also by New Zealand and it agreed that Australia would announce recognition in the course of the day.

7\. It also agreed that messages arising from the Committee’s discussion should be sent on a personal basis by the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of Britain, the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Prime Minister of Singapore,1 and that the United States should be kept informed of Australian views.2

8\. A press statement reflecting suitable parts of the discussion is to be issued by the Prime Minister.3
