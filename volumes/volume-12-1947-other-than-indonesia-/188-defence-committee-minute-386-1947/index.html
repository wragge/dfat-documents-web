<p>CO-OPERATION IN BRITISH COMMONWEALTH DEFENCE: DIRECTIVES TO DEFENCE REPRESENTATIVES IN UNITED KINGDOM AND UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>

<p>Agendum No.127/1947 Supplement No.5</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>In Minute No.325/1947 the Defence Committee directed, inter alia, that the Joint Planning Committee should consider and report whether any instructions in the form of directives to the Defence Representatives in London and Washington are required to cover matters additional to those contained in Parts III and IV of the Australian Government’s Memorandum on Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence.</p>

<p>Report by Joint Planning Committee:</p>

<p>2. The Defence Committee had before it Report No.53/1947 by the Joint Planning Committee, in which the adoption of proposed directives, attached as Appendices ‘A’ and ‘B’ to the Report, was recommended.</p>

<p>Consideration:</p>

<p>3. Whilst the Defence Committee assumed that prior to taking up their appointments, the Defence Representatives in the United Kingdom and the United States of America would be made acquainted, inter alia, with the contents of the Australian Government’s Memorandum No. 1-Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence, the Committee felt that it was desirable for the Representatives to be furnished with specific directives based on the duties outlined in Parts III and IV of the Memorandum.</p>

<p>4. The Defence Committee expressed the view that it should be clearly indicated in the directives that the Defence Representatives in the United Kingdom and the United States of America would be responsible for dealing with all matters of a Defence Policy or Joint Service nature and for effecting such co- ordination as is necessary with the Australian Representative in the respective countries.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>5. In the light of the foregoing the Defence Committee concluded that instructions in the form of directives to the Defence Representatives in the United Kingdom and the United States of America should be issued on the lines set out in the attached Appendices ‘A’ and ‘B’.</p>

<p>F.A. MCLAUGHLIN Secretary Defence Committee</p>

<p>Appendix A</p>

<p>PROPOSED DIRECTIVE TO THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM</p>

<p>2. You will be the authority in the United Kingdom responsible for dealing with all matters of a Defence Policy or Joint Service nature and for effecting such coordination as is necessary with the Australian Service Representatives in the United Kingdom.</p>
