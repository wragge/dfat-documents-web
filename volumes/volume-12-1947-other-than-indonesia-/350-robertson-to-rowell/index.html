<p>Cipher Message 7012 [TOKYO], 6 August 1947</p>

<p>PERSONAL MOST IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET</p>

<p>Your GS 5674.</p>

<p>1. I do not agree with the terms of the Aust. Draft Peace Treaty in its provision for an Allied Force of Occupation as I consider the proposal quite impracticable and I am certain that it would be regarded as provocative.</p>

<p>2. The occupation of Japan up till now has been without incident because the Japanese, are obeying an order of their Emperor and the great majority of their ex-servicemen like the German Army in 1918/19 do not believe they have been defeated. With constant talk of peace they are already showing their feelings. Certain moderate elements in the country are anxious to retain the power they now have and sections of the women are likewise appreciating their new freedom. If these things are to be developed it must be by the will of the Japanese Government elected by their people and as long as that Government is in no danger of becoming overthrown by revolutionary elements no armed forces are required to support it.</p>

<p>3. Any proposal to establish in Japan armed forces drawn on a number of different nations would give a situation worse than the tower of Babel with certain nations endeavouring to get control of certain areas for their own ends and there is no man in the world who could command such a force.</p>

<p>4. Australia is often criticised by the more thinking Japanese as being a country with tremendous area and only seven million people which is being vindictive to Japan under the shelter of the larger nations. While the political side of that is not my concern I feel that it is unwise for Australia to take the lead on any such proposal.</p>

<p>5 . I am of opinion that if Japan means to rearm for war again after the peace treaty a small occupation force will not stop her but will merely drive certain elements underground and lead to a lot of deceit and unpleasant incidents. A Supervisory Commission with a highly skilled intelligence organisation with access to all Japanese Governmental Records is necessary but there should be nothing further in Japan itself which could be regarded as provocative or as giving the impression that we do not believe Japan is going to adopt Democracy. By that means I believe you can have warning but nothing you could put in Japan itself would stop her from rebuilding if she meant to do it. It is the knowledge of the power of the other nations outside Japan which may keep her on the rails not some token force inside Japan. It may be necessary for the efficient running of the various Embassies and their Supervisory Commission with its intelligence to have some form of unit such as an Embassy Guard but I believe that the less uniform seen in Japan after the Peace Treaty the better will be the results.</p>
