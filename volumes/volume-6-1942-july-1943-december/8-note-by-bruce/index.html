<h2 id="london-20-july-1942">[LONDON], 20 July 1942</h2>

<p>SECOND FRONT IN EUROPE</p>

<p>As a result of the Hopkins-Marshall visit to London in April our</p>

<p>primary strategic objective was agreed as the creation of a second</p>

<p>front.</p>

<p>To achieve this objective the maximum land and air forces are</p>

<p>being concentrated in the United Kingdom as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>While for the final achievement of victory a landing in force in</p>

<p>Europe will be necessary, the primary objective of the policy of a</p>

<p>second front in Europe was to relieve the pressure on the</p>

<p>Russians.</p>

<p>The time when the affording of relief to the Russians would have</p>

<p>the maximum effect would be during the present Summer.</p>

<p>While raids on an increasing scale can probably be staged against</p>

<p>the continent of Europe during the present Summer it now seems</p>

<p>clear that an operation on a magnitude that would compel the</p>

<p>withdrawal of sufficient forces as to afford relief to the</p>

<p>Russians cannot be staged before the Spring of next year.</p>

<p>If the policy of a second front in Europe could have been</p>

<p>implemented so as to afford relief to the Russians during the</p>

<p>present year, it would clearly be desirable to pursue it at almost</p>

<p>any cost.</p>

<p>As large scale operations against Europe cannot be undertaken</p>

<p>before the Spring of next year, I suggest the policy of the</p>

<p>creation of a European second front in the near future requires</p>

<p>reconsideration.</p>

<p>In such reconsideration we have to examine the possibility and</p>

<p>value of a European offensive in the Spring of next year.</p>

<p>In determining the possibility and value of such an offensive</p>

<p>various alternative developments in Russia have to be considered.</p>

<p>In the event-</p>

<p>(a) that the German attack on Russia has failed to achieve any</p>

<p>material success, or</p>

<p>(b) that the German attack on Russia has achieved considerable</p>

<p>success but the Soviet armies are still intact and capable of</p>

<p>seriously continuing the struggle,</p>

<p>the staging of a major offensive and the creation of a second</p>

<p>front in Europe should both be possible and of the utmost value.</p>

<p>On the other hand if the German attack on Russia has succeeded</p>

<p>either in eliminating the Soviet from the war or in bringing the</p>

<p>Russians to the point where they can be held by the utilisation of</p>

<p>relatively small Axis forces, any operation we could undertake</p>

<p>against Europe in the Spring of 1943 would have little prospect of</p>

<p>success.</p>

<p>In view of these possible alternative developments we have to</p>

<p>consider whether the wisest course is to continue the</p>

<p>concentration of the necessary forces in the United Kingdom for</p>

<p>the purpose of a major offensive against Europe in the Spring of</p>

<p>1943, or whether there is another alternative course that we would</p>

<p>be better advised to pursue.</p>

<p>In order to determine this, it is necessary to consider the</p>

<p>results that would flow from the continuance of the concentration</p>

<p>in the United Kingdom in the alternative developments that are</p>

<p>above visualised.</p>

<p>In the event of the developments being down the lines suggested in</p>

<p>(a) or (b) of paragraph 9 above, it would be of great value to be</p>

<p>in a position to undertake a large scale offensive against Europe.</p>

<p>Before determining to pursue this course, however, it has to be</p>

<p>decided-</p>

<p>(a) whether the dangers of pursuing a policy of concentration in</p>

<p>the United Kingdom for an offensive in Europe in the Spring of</p>

<p>1943 do not, in the event of a Russian collapse, out-weigh the</p>

<p>advantages if the Russians hold, and</p>

<p>(b) if there is any alternative policy to that of a direct frontal</p>

<p>attack on Europe which while yielding substantial dividends in the</p>

<p>event of the Russians holding would reduce the dangers in the</p>

<p>event of the Russians collapsing.</p>

<p>With regard to (a)-without delaying here to set out all the</p>

<p>arguments, it can, I suggest, be shown that the strain that has</p>

<p>been imposed upon the whole German economic and transport system,</p>

<p>as well as upon the people, is such that unless the Russians</p>

<p>collapse, or are so badly mauled as to afford a period for relief</p>

<p>and reorganisation, the eventual collapse of Germany is</p>

<p>inevitable.</p>

<p>A full scale frontal attack on Europe would accelerate this</p>

<p>collapse. Such a collapse is, however, inevitable unless Germany</p>

<p>can obtain a respite. This respite can be prevented by the policy</p>

<p>I suggest below, even if not to the same extent as it would be if</p>

<p>it were possible to stage a full scale frontal attack on Europe.</p>

<p>This alternative policy also has the advantage that should a</p>

<p>frontal attack become impossible, owing to the collapse of Russia,</p>

<p>Germany would still be denied the respite that is vital to her.</p>

<p>With regard to (b)-an alternative policy I suggest would be a full</p>

<p>scale attack on Northern Africa in the present year.</p>

<p>Such an attack would have to be of a sufficient magnitude to</p>

<p>ensure its success both in regard to land and air forces. What the</p>

<p>scale of such an attack would have to be is a matter for our</p>

<p>Service advisers but while it would present a tremendous task,</p>

<p>particularly in providing the necessary shipping, nevertheless it</p>

<p>would appear a less formidable undertaking than a frontal attack</p>

<p>on Europe.</p>

<p>The result of success would be-</p>

<p>To enable us to obtain control of the Western Mediterranean and</p>

<p>relieve Malta</p>

<p>To alter the whole position of our forces in the Middle East</p>

<p>To render possible action against Italy, the weakest link in the</p>

<p>Axis To pave the way to our re-entering the Continent via the</p>

<p>Balkans. It would not preclude the continuance of the policy of</p>

<p>direct raids upon Europe.</p>

<p>Even in the event of the collapse of Russia it should enable us to</p>

<p>deny to the Germans that period of respite which is vital to them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we concentrate upon a full scale frontal</p>

<p>attack against Europe in the Spring of 1943 and Russia collapses</p>

<p>we would be unable to proceed with our plans and Germany would be</p>

<p>enabled to carry out that rehabilitation of her whole system which</p>

<p>on all the evidence I have seen is vital to her.</p>

<p>Two points that have to be considered are-</p>

<p>(a) What degree of resistance would be offered by the French in</p>

<p>North Africa.</p>

<p>(b) What would be the effect on our relations with Vichy France.</p>

<p>With regard to (a) considerable resistance at the outset would</p>

<p>have to be anticipated as the Vichy Government has packed all</p>

<p>important civil and military positions in Northern Africa with</p>

<p>pro-Axis sympathisers. This resistance would be likely to collapse</p>

<p>after a short period if the enterprise were undertaken on an</p>

<p>adequate scale.</p>

<p>With regard to (b) the reaction of the Vichy Government would be</p>

<p>strongly hostile. The question that has to be determined is how</p>

<p>far public opinion in France would react to an attack in North</p>

<p>Africa as against the raids culminating in a grand offensive</p>

<p>against metropolitan France which are contemplated.</p>

<p>The object of this Note is to stress the necessity for the most</p>

<p>careful consideration of-</p>

<p>(i) The situation that would arise in the event of our</p>

<p>concentrating our preparations upon a full scale frontal attack on</p>

<p>Europe in the Spring of 1943 and then finding as a result of</p>

<p>developments in Russia and/or elsewhere it being impossible to</p>

<p>launch it.</p>

<p>(ii) The possibility of an attack in North Africa or elsewhere</p>

<p>without the qualification that such an attack must be conditioned</p>

<p>by its not interfering with a full scale frontal attack on Europe.</p>
