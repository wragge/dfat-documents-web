                          <p>Letter CHUNGKING, 29 July 1942</p>

<p>PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>I want to write you a letter somewhat more informal than the</p>

<p>private and Confidential letters you have had from me. I want to</p>

<p>place before you some of the unsatisfactory Conditions which exist</p>

<p>in our relations with the External Affairs Department but I do not</p>

<p>wish to complain as the defects which exist may be due to lack of</p>

<p>staff or other war exigencies or to your disagreement with my</p>

<p>ideas of what is necessary. All I want you to know is that the</p>

<p>present conditions are a serious hindrance to our efficiency. I</p>

<p>have watched the working of the British Embassy in its relations</p>

<p>with the Foreign Office and other services and I would not rate</p>

<p>the efficiency of the Foreign Office as more than sixty to seventy</p>

<p>per cent but the External Affairs Department must be rated as</p>

<p>lower than this. The defects may be summed up under two headings:-</p>

<p>(a) Absence of an efficient administrative system directed to</p>

<p>supplying the needs of the Legation.</p>

<p>(b) Lack of imagination to realise what the needs of a legation</p>

<p>are.</p>

<p>1. Information</p>

<p>Our greatest lack is information of what is going on in Australia</p>

<p>and generally of news behind the news. Our news is scanty enough</p>

<p>but of confidential information we receive nothing. Some letters</p>

<p>may have been miscarried but I have had no letters whatever about</p>

<p>our work though many of my letters asked for answers. (I shall</p>

<p>deal later with answers to cables.) This means that:-</p>

<p>(a) We have only a shadowy idea of Government policy.</p>

<p>(b) We receive little or no information of Government decisions or</p>

<p>agreements made by it.</p>

<p>(c) When negotiations go on with the Chinese Minister in Australia</p>

<p>[1] nothing is disclosed to us. As the Chinese insist on</p>

<p>negotiations at both ends this is most embarrassing to us. It is</p>

<p>the A.B.C. of diplomatic practice to keep ministers informed of</p>

<p>these communications.</p>

<p>(d) We receive no confidential information as to operations in the</p>

<p>Pacific Zone or as to war production. As to (b), we received in</p>

<p>the last mail a table showing the arrangement for General</p>

<p>MacArthur’s command. I believe you will see that information on</p>

<p>these points is necessary to us. It is recognised that we should</p>

<p>receive much of this information and for some weeks a News</p>

<p>Bulletin was sent but this comes very irregularly now, about three</p>

<p>times in seven weeks and contains little besides what can be read</p>

<p>in the newspapers. Frankly, Mr. Gollan’s ‘Austral News’ in India,</p>

<p>compiled from information given by the Commerce Department, is far</p>

<p>more valuable to us than anything we have received from our own</p>

<p>Department. He could obtain his information at a time when we were</p>

<p>receiving nothing because of the non-arrival of bags.</p>

<p>2. Diplomatic bags</p>

<p>As you probably know, for four months we received absolutely</p>

<p>nothing from Australia by bag. I gather that three bags have been</p>

<p>lost. Now eight bags have arrived and we are busy digesting them.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the delay in the arrival of the bags was due</p>

<p>to slackness on the part of the naval authorities at various</p>

<p>points along the journey. When we first cabled the Department,</p>

<p>they got in touch with the Navy who informed the Department that</p>

<p>enquiries were being made for them at various points in the Indian</p>

<p>Ocean (see Telegrams Nos. 95, 126, 133 [2]). In fact, the bags had</p>

<p>never left Australia and bags from the end of January to the end</p>

<p>of May were despatched about the first week in June.</p>

<p>These facts seem to me to entirely displace the suggestion now</p>

<p>made that the bags were held for safe despatch and to indicate</p>

<p>that they were probably overlooked. There was another hold-up</p>

<p>after they reached India and we did not receive them until 21st</p>

<p>July. After we had made enquiries through the King’s Messenger</p>

<p>they were suddenly released. I know that the responsibility for</p>

<p>the bags is the Navy’s but I suggest that the Department is</p>

<p>responsible for ensuring that our wants are attended to. A system</p>

<p>of receipts should be installed to prevent this sort of thing. I</p>

<p>am also of the opinion that the naval officers responsible should</p>

<p>be called on to explain and disciplinary action taken if they are</p>

<p>at fault. I was in the Australian Headquarters during the last war</p>

<p>and there was no slackness of this kind.</p>

<p>3. Answers to telegrams</p>

<p>I have sent a list of queries made by us which have not been</p>

<p>answered [3], and have received explanations [4], the chief burden</p>

<p>of which is that the queries were passed on to the departments</p>

<p>concerned and no reply was received. I would point out that here</p>

<p>also administrative methods exist for pursuing enquiries and also</p>

<p>that it is often necessary for us to know if a query is likely to</p>

<p>be answered. If, for instance, we receive a request from the</p>

<p>British Ambassador or a Chinese Department for information, it</p>

<p>makes us look ridiculous to have to confess after weeks that no</p>

<p>notice has been taken of our request. We could save some ‘face’ if</p>

<p>we could say that the information was not available.</p>

<p>There is another matter on which I wish to speak. I have sent you</p>

<p>a number of despatches containing my views on the issues which</p>

<p>arise in this part of the field and the method by which the war</p>

<p>has been conducted as shown by the evidence I have seen. [5] I</p>

<p>have been very definite but I am not dogmatic in my opinions for I</p>

<p>realise how cut off I am here. My views on most of these matters</p>

<p>have been written without any information from outside or any</p>

<p>knowledge of opinions expressed by members of the Government.</p>

<p>After a close study of press articles contained in our bags which</p>

<p>arrived last week, I feel that my views, or rather the views I was</p>

<p>recording, have been remarkably in accord with your own. For</p>

<p>instance, in the ‘Sydney Bulletin’ of March 4th appears your</p>

<p>criticism of coordination between London, Washington and</p>

<p>Australia. Shortly after this, my friend Major-General van Temmen</p>

<p>[6] was in India hearing from General Wavell a similar criticism</p>

<p>of the same system. This I was able to cable to you when you were</p>

<p>in New York [7] and you appeared to appreciate it. [8] For these</p>

<p>reasons, I would very much appreciate something from you as to</p>

<p>whether after your trip you believe the points I have been</p>

<p>hammering at are still important. [9] I have no doubt that a great</p>

<p>many of the defects we have encountered have been cleared up in</p>

<p>the new arrangements that have been made.</p>

<p>I have followed up the question of Imperial co-ordination for</p>

<p>defence for over thirty years and it seems to me that defects in</p>

<p>practice grow out of two main causes-from organisation and</p>

<p>personal considerations-and the two overlap. An organisation can</p>

<p>always be a facade and provide cover for powerful personalities to</p>

<p>achieve their policies. Therefore, when we join war cabinets and</p>

<p>other like organisations we must remember that we become</p>

<p>minorities in organs dominated by others. The remedy for this is</p>

<p>to strengthen the operative parts and, therefore, professional</p>

<p>officers whom you send in liaison to the Chiefs-of-Staff should be</p>

<p>of the highest possible calibre in character and mind, not</p>

<p>juniors. They must make themselves listened to and report to the</p>

<p>Australian Government if they are not. I have seen the names of</p>

<p>some of the appointees and notice that this has been in your mind.</p>

<p>I believe you will find that the Chiefs-of-Staff often differ from</p>

<p>political heads and would like some reinforcement of their</p>

<p>position but they will not take it from junior officers. Moreover,</p>

<p>one of the difficulties is the pre-occupation with other theatres</p>

<p>of war. I am strongly of the opinion, from what I have heard here,</p>

<p>that no proper appreciations of the position in the Far East were</p>

<p>made, at any rate, after the Japanese occupied Indo-China. The</p>

<p>excuse was ‘too busy elsewhere’ but if our men were there they</p>

<p>could make these appreciations and force them on the attention of</p>

<p>the staffs.</p>

<p>Another thing to be considered is that Roosevelt is very</p>

<p>autocratic and even more inclined to take matters into his own</p>

<p>hands than Churchill. This is evident by the number of people who</p>

<p>report to him direct. Here there are at least six about whose</p>

<p>advice the Ambassador knows nothing. There are also numerous cases</p>

<p>where he takes decisions and the department concerned does not</p>

<p>know of them until they appear in the press.</p>

<p>The Washington Pacific War Council will, therefore, be dominated</p>

<p>by Roosevelt and he will be guided by public opinion. American</p>

<p>opinion is difficult to handle. I believe it is far more</p>

<p>capricious than in Britain. The American collective mind is</p>

<p>dispersed, capable of holding strongly opposed opinions at the</p>

<p>same time and it is not inherently friendly, however effusive it</p>

<p>may be, and is likely to be alienated by any signs of criticism on</p>

<p>the one hand and of fear and panic on the other. So far as I</p>

<p>understand it, the arrangement you have made with the United</p>

<p>States in regard to MacArthur and his command is an excellent</p>

<p>example of the right principles to apply but of course this cannot</p>

<p>cover supply.</p>

<p>I hope you will not consider these observations out of place. I</p>

<p>feel so intensely interested in these matters and have so much</p>

<p>time for thought that I cannot help forming opinions.</p>

<p>On the personal side I have thought it my duty to say many things</p>

<p>simply because I formed the opinion that so far as this part of</p>

<p>the world was concerned, the British authorities were not showing</p>

<p>the qualities necessary to win the war or handle the problems. It</p>

<p>goes against the grain to do this because I am a devotee of the</p>

<p>British way of life and have done as much as any private citizen</p>

<p>of Australia to promote British and Australian collaboration,</p>

<p>especially for defence. But I realise their position. The</p>

<p>responsibility thrust on them in the present war has been</p>

<p>stupendous and few nations who criticise them would have stood up</p>

<p>to the strain. We in Australia have not been asked to take on such</p>

<p>a strain and so we do not know how we would have got on.</p>

<p>Personally I think we have the intensity and adaptability to play</p>

<p>an effective part. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the</p>

<p>British have developed a powerful system in their public life</p>

<p>which is never really defined and understood but is acknowledged</p>

<p>by everyone as paramount; which must not be questioned and will</p>

<p>not be explained. Men are transferred into it from various strata</p>

<p>of society and if, being able, they try to change it, they</p>

<p>experience frustration and disappointment. The justification for</p>

<p>this system is that by it the British Empire was built up but it</p>

<p>seems to have crystallised and when world conditions have changed</p>

<p>there is no power of adaptation.</p>

<p>There is evidence, too, that such a system is not effectively</p>

<p>integrated; that it cannot focus effectively on the needs of the</p>

<p>situation. When the Germans attacked the Russians the British had</p>

<p>twelve months to formulate their re-actions to the world</p>

<p>situation, decide on their strategic positions and make</p>

<p>dispositions accordingly. This was never done. I find no evidence</p>

<p>of any intensive brainwork on the problems of Hongkong, Malaya and</p>

<p>Burma or the Far East generally, or any clear theory as to how to</p>

<p>tackle the problems which would arise in these places when the war</p>

<p>broke out. The tendency to say ‘Singapore will do the trick’ was</p>

<p>universal. As you know, there were many in Australia who had a</p>

<p>much more correct appreciation than that. The worst feature about</p>

<p>the position was that the British authorities always declared to</p>

<p>us that the preparations in the Far East were adequate and</p>

<p>afterwards said it was impossible to hold their strong points. If</p>

<p>you have made an effective impression on the system and given</p>

<p>Australia a safe position within it, you will have earned all our</p>

<p>gratitude.</p>

<p>I have spent the last few days in reading the Australian press and</p>

<p>I must say it fills me with pessimism. I do deeply sympathise with</p>

<p>the Government in having to put up with this. Few pressmen have</p>

<p>constructive minds and some seem psychopathic. One would gather</p>

<p>that Australia was in a state of panic and demoralisation. It is a</p>

<p>very dangerous mood to create with America looking on in a</p>

<p>critical frame of mind. Governments have immense responsibilities</p>

<p>today and it is not fair that they should be increased by an</p>

<p>irresponsible press.</p>

<p>We have had a month’s intense heat here and are all feeling rather</p>

<p>prostrated by it. Mr. Waller has been in bed the last week with</p>

<p>either malaria or some kidney trouble. He is a tower of strength</p>

<p>to me and I rely on him very much.</p>
