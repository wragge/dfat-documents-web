<p>Cablegram Winch 25 LONDON, [11 July 1942] [1]</p>

<p>PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET</p>

<p>I am very glad that the 9th Australian Division is now in action</p>

<p>in the Western Desert, and I am most thankful to you for making it</p>

<p>available for this vital key point of the war.</p>

<p>2. The unforeseeable tide of disaster which drove us from Gazala</p>

<p>to Alamein with the loss of Tobruk and 50,000 men has now for the</p>

<p>time being been stemmed. General Auchinleck has received strong</p>

<p>reinforcements raising his army to 100,000 men with another 20,000</p>

<p>well forward in the Delta behind them. He is thus about double</p>

<p>Rommel [2] in men. He has a fair equality in artillery but is</p>

<p>still somewhat weaker in armour to the enemy. This imposes</p>

<p>prudence upon him for two reasons. First, a retirement is much</p>

<p>worse for him than for Rommel who has nothing but deserts behind</p>

<p>him and, secondly, far more strength is coming to General</p>

<p>Auchinleck than to the enemy.</p>

<p>3. For instance, the 8th Armoured Division with 350 Valentine</p>

<p>Tanks has landed and will soon be in action. About 400 tanks of</p>

<p>all natures, having been despatched before the battle began, will</p>

<p>reach General Auchinleck in July and early August as replacements.</p>

<p>The 44th British Infantry Divisisdon fully equipped, 15,000 strong</p>

<p>with 72 guns, should have arrived by the end of July and the 51st</p>

<p>British Infantry Division a month later.</p>

<p>4. It was very fortunate that four months ago I obtained from</p>

<p>President Roosevelt the shipping to carry an additional 40,000 men</p>

<p>to the East without deciding on their destination till they</p>

<p>rounded the Cape. Without these, the reinforcements now proved so</p>

<p>needful by the hazards of war could not have been at hand.</p>

<p>5. When in Washington, I obtained from the President 300 of the</p>

<p>latest and finest tanks (Shermans) in the American Army. They were</p>

<p>taken from the very hands of the American troops who eagerly</p>

<p>awaited them, and were sent by special convoy direct to Suez. With</p>

<p>them went one hundred 105 MM. self-propelled guns which definitely</p>

<p>outmatch the 88 MM., the whole being accompanied by a large number</p>

<p>of American key men. These should arrive early September. Apart</p>

<p>from the 8th Armoured Division and in addition to the two armoured</p>

<p>and one army tank brigades now in action forward, we have in the</p>

<p>Delta the personnel of four armoured brigades awaiting re-</p>

<p>equipment. About half these men are desert trained in tanks. We</p>

<p>should therefore be able to bring into action incomparably the</p>

<p>most powerful and best trained armoured division yet seen in the</p>

<p>Mid East or indeed anywhere. But I hope the issue will be decided</p>

<p>in our favour earlier. This is especially desirable because of</p>

<p>dangers that may, though I do not say they will, develop on the</p>

<p>Northern approaches to Egypt.</p>

<p>6. Scarcely less important are the air reinforcements given me by</p>

<p>the President on the morrow of Tobruk. As you know we have not</p>

<p>been hitherto able for technical as well as military reasons to</p>

<p>provide heavy bomber squadrons for the Mid East, though they have</p>

<p>often asked for them. But now the President has assigned to the</p>

<p>defence of Egypt the Halpro Group of 20 Liberators which was on</p>

<p>its way to India, after bombing Rumanian oilfields, 10 other</p>

<p>Liberators which had already reached India and a group of 35</p>

<p>Liberators from the United States. These, with our own Liberators,</p>

<p>make up about 85 of these heavy bombers which should all be</p>

<p>available this month. At the same time our two Halifax Squadrons</p>

<p>will come into action, making up to 117 heavy bombers in all. It</p>

<p>is this force I rely upon to beat up the ports of Tobruk and</p>

<p>Benghazi, hampering Rommel’s reinforcements, besides of course</p>

<p>playing the part of a battle-fleet in preventing a seaborne</p>

<p>invasion of Egypt. We have great enterprises in preparation for</p>

<p>the re-victualling of Malta but as these deal with future</p>

<p>operations you will not, I am sure, wish me to mention details.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the President sent about 70 of his</p>

<p>latest Kittyhawks across in the carrier ‘Ranger’ which should soon</p>

<p>be reaching West Africa.</p>

<p>7. Besides this, every preparation has been made to defend the</p>

<p>Delta should the battles in the desert go against us. Here we have</p>

<p>very large numbers of men all of whom have been ordered to take</p>

<p>part in the defence of Egypt exactly as if it were England that</p>

<p>was invaded. Cultivation and irrigation of the Delta make it</p>

<p>literally the worst ground in the world for armoured vehicles, and</p>

<p>armour as a factor would lose a great deal of its predominance.</p>

<p>All ideas of evacuation have been repressed, the intention being</p>

<p>to fight for every yard of ground to the end. As I have said,</p>

<p>however, I do not think this situation will arise.</p>

<p>8. We are having a great struggle to carry supplies to Russia. One</p>

<p>fifth of the June convoy was sunk and I fear less than one half of</p>

<p>the July convoy got through. The difficulties and dangers of this</p>

<p>route are enormous especially during the season of perpetual</p>

<p>daylight. This is serious as it is almost the only thing we can do</p>

<p>for our brilliant ally who is taking so heavy a toll of Hitler’s</p>

<p>armies and will, I am confident, endure to the end. To show you</p>

<p>what a good comrade Premier Stalin is proving himself, they have</p>

<p>offered us three divisions of partly equipped Poles for the</p>

<p>Levant-Caspian Theatre and have transferred to Egypt 40 Boston</p>

<p>fighter bombers which were on the way to them through Basra. In</p>

<p>this last matter, the President was my intermediary.</p>

<p>9. The House of Commons has proved a rock in these difficult days,</p>

<p>as it did in the struggle against Napoleon, and I have also been</p>

<p>greatly encouraged by the goodwill of your Government and people.</p>

<p>I never felt more sure that complete ultimate victory will be</p>

<p>ours. But the struggle will be long and we must not relax for an</p>

<p>instant. [3]</p>

<p>2 Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in North Africa.</p>

<p>3 Bruce commented on Winch 25 that ‘more stress should be laid on</p>

<p>the necessity for early action and less on the growing strength of</p>

<p>our position in the future’. See cablegram 104A of 14 July on file</p>

<p>AA:M100, July 1942.</p>
