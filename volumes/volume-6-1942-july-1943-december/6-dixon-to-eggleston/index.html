<h2 id="letter-washington-13-july-1942">Letter WASHINGTON, 13 July 1942</h2>

<p>Many thanks for your letter of 10th June [1] enclosing your letter</p>

<p>to Sir Earle Page. [2]</p>

<p>I have never had enough information to form any reasoned judgment</p>

<p>about the causes of the disasters in Singapore and Burmah and my</p>

<p>instinctive forebodings springing from such isolated facts as I</p>

<p>have learned from trustworthy sources are of a kind that it is</p>

<p>better to suppress. In considering the Allied central organization</p>

<p>for the conduct of the war, it is, I think, necessary to</p>

<p>distinguish between the past and the present. Up till very</p>

<p>recently London was, I believe, the centre controlling world</p>

<p>strategy: now I think that it is Washington. It is here that the</p>

<p>Combined Chiefs of Staff meet-and here that the order of battle</p>

<p>for each theatre is settled and it is here that the primary</p>

<p>allocation of the pooled production is decided and the detailed</p>

<p>allocation of the United States production takes place. of course</p>

<p>the Chiefs of Staff in London exert a powerful influence. I am not</p>

<p>in a position to assess the part played by Roosevelt and</p>

<p>Churchill.</p>

<p>The first I have now seen a number of times; my first-hand</p>

<p>knowledge of the second is confined to one day. But I am inclined</p>

<p>to the view that neither plays such an original or such a dominant</p>

<p>part as in Australia we were led to suppose. When there has been</p>

<p>an opposition between the professional advice of the services and</p>

<p>political exigencies or considerations of a mixed nature, as in</p>

<p>the cases of Greece, and of convoys to Murmansk, the decision has</p>

<p>been that of the Prime Minister and the President. But I think</p>

<p>that now at all events it is the professional advisers who mould</p>

<p>the strategical opinion of the governments. Once a theatre of war</p>

<p>is put under American control, there is a great reluctance on the</p>

<p>part of the British Chiefs of Staff to raise questions about what</p>

<p>is being done and this, though to a less extent, is true in the</p>

<p>converse case.</p>

<p>To my mind the fundamental cause of all our troubles is the simple</p>

<p>fact that the enemy continues to have a marked superiority in arms</p>

<p>and trained troops in all theatres. The cry for aeroplanes comes</p>

<p>in from every commander and day by day attempts are made to find</p>

<p>planes to help this or that command or theatre. In the planning,</p>

<p>how to divide a deficiency is always the question. of course</p>

<p>production is expanding rapidly now.</p>

<p>I am by no means satisfied with the central organization for the</p>

<p>control of the war on the part of the Allies, and I don’t really</p>

<p>know whose are the decisive minds. Indeed I cannot feel that</p>

<p>operation of mind in action of which I think you are always</p>

<p>conscious when powerful intelligences are directing events. Much</p>

<p>of the organization is just a facade forming part of the make-</p>

<p>believe which democratic governments seem to find indispensable.</p>

<p>But I doubt whether any attempt to improve the organization</p>

<p>existing now would lead to anything more satisfactory.</p>

<p>There is no lack of interest either in Australia or in China. The</p>

<p>President continually reverts to the question of China and T. V.</p>

<p>Soong [3] is active. But it always appears to me to come back to</p>

<p>the question of arms, trained troops and transport. General plans</p>

<p>are, I know, made with much consideration and care though the</p>

<p>soldiers seldom allow us to know with any accuracy what exactly</p>

<p>they are, but the urgent necessity repeatedly arising of meeting</p>

<p>desperate demands from one threatened front after another makes me</p>

<p>very sceptical about the practical value of the general plans.</p>

<p>Naturally I feel very anxious about Australia’s position.</p>

<p>MacArthur’s representations have some weight and so do those of</p>

<p>our government, but it remains very difficult to obtain what we</p>

<p>should have. We are sticking to the question and I am glad to say</p>

<p>we are receiving the support of Sir John Dill who is one of the</p>

<p>Combined Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>I hope this letter is not too depressing but at present I feel the</p>

<p>difficulties and the want of a solution.</p>

<p>OWEN DIXON</p>
