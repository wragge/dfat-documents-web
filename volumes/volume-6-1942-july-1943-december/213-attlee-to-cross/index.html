<p>(a) in co-operation with Russian and other Allies, to bring about at the earliest possible date the unconditional surrender of the Axis in Europe;</p>

<p>(b) simultaneously, in co-operation with other Pacific powers, to maintain and extend unremitting pressure against Japan with the purpose of continually reducing her military power and attaining positions from which her ultimate surrender can be forced. The effect of any such extension of overall objective to be given consideration by Combined Chiefs of Staff before action is taken;</p>

<p>(c) upon defeat of Axis in Europe, in co-operation with other Pacific powers, and, if possible, with Russia, to direct the full resources of the United States and Great Britain to bring about at the earliest possible date the unconditional surrender of Japan.</p>

<p>2. Whatever operations are decided on in support of over-all strategical concept, the following established undertakings will be a first charge against our resources subject to review by Combined Chiefs of Staff in keeping with the changing situation:-</p>

<p>(a) maintain the security and war-making capacity of the Western Hemisphere and British Isles;</p>

<p>(b) support the war-making capacity of our forces in all areas;</p>

<p>(c) maintain vital overseas lines of communication, with particular emphasis on defeat of U-boat menace;</p>

<p>(d) intensify the air offensive against Axis powers in Europe;</p>

<p>(e) concentrate maximum resources in a selected area, as early as practicable for the purpose of conducting a decisive invasion of Axis citadel;</p>

<p>(f) undertake such measures as may be necessary and practicable to aid the war effort of Russia;</p>

<p>(g) undertake such measures as may be necessary and practicable in order to aid the war effort of China as an effective ally and as a base for operations against Japan;</p>

<p>(h) to prepare the ground for active or passive participation of Turkey in the war on the side of the Allies;</p>

<p>(i) to prepare the French forces in Africa to fulfil an active role in the war against the Axis powers.</p>

<p>(ii) to establish forces and equipment in the United Kingdom for securing a lodgment on the Continent from which future offensive operations can be carried out. Also to keep ready plans for an emergency crossing of the Channel in the event of a German collapse and for sending forces to Norway in the event of a German evacuation becoming apparent;</p>

<p>(iii) to make available in the Mediterranean substantial forces for such, operations as are best calculated to eliminate Italy from the war and to contain the maximum number of German forces;</p>
