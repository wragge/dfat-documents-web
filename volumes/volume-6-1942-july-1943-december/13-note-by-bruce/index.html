                          <p>[LONDON], 30 July 1942</p>

<p>PROVISION OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE WAR AT SEA [1]</p>

<p>The Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee W.P. (42) 302 appears</p>

<p>to me to be a most unsatisfactory and illogical document. It has</p>

<p>all the appearance of a compromise between sharply divergent</p>

<p>points of view. [2]</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how the Chiefs of Staff accepted the</p>

<p>compromise in face of the sombre picture they themselves draw in</p>

<p>paragraph 4 of their report.</p>

<p>The Report was based on the strategy contained in Memorandum W.W.1</p>

<p>[3], which is interpreted as requiring our commitments to be met</p>

<p>in the following order of priority-</p>

<p>(a) Minimum necessary fighter defence for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>(b) Minimum necessary allocation for securing our vital</p>

<p>communications and interrupting those of the enemy.</p>

<p>(c) Maximum possible provision for the offensive both direct and</p>

<p>in support of land operations.</p>

<p>With this order of priority provision for the offensive, both</p>

<p>direct and indirect, insofar as it is not for the purpose of</p>

<p>ensuring our vital communications and interrupting those of the</p>

<p>enemy, must be subordinated to this primary objective. This means</p>

<p>that the requirements of Bomber Command for the offensive on</p>

<p>Germany must be regarded as subsidiary to the protection of our</p>

<p>sea communications.</p>

<p>With this background, which is set out in their paper, the Chiefs</p>

<p>of Staff make their report and submit their recommendations. A</p>

<p>careful study of the report and recommendations, however, shows</p>

<p>that the Chiefs of Staff have not followed the priorities laid</p>

<p>down but make additional action for the defence of sea</p>

<p>communications subsidiary to the requirements of Bomber Command.</p>

<p>There are many examples in respect to all the areas dealt with in</p>

<p>the Chiefs of Staff report. The following are a few of them which</p>

<p>I give to illustrate my point-</p>

<p>In the Home area the report states-</p>

<p>‘The primary and immediate need is for an increased number of long</p>

<p>range aircraft for anti-submarine patrols in the home area</p>

<p>particularly the Bay of Biscay as well as for reconnaissance</p>

<p>aircraft for work with the Home Fleet and to impose our blockade</p>

<p>measures.’</p>

<p>As this need is for the purpose of ‘securing our vital</p>

<p>communications and interrupting those of the enemy’ it is a first</p>

<p>priority. The method proposed for meeting it, however, does not</p>

<p>accord such priority. It contemplates providing a certain number</p>

<p>of Lancasters. This, however, in the words of the report ‘would be</p>

<p>done in general at the expense of the mining effort’. The mining</p>

<p>effort is similar in purpose to that for which the Lancasters</p>

<p>would be made available to Coastal Command. This really means the</p>

<p>robbing of Peter to pay Paul. Further-‘the number of aircraft</p>

<p>available each week for anti-submarine patrols from these two</p>

<p>sources (i.e. Operational Training Units and Bomber Command) will</p>

<p>fluctuate according to the inciden[ce] of Operational Unit</p>

<p>Training Courses and the necessity for concentrating all available</p>

<p>aircraft when very large scale raids are to be made on Germany’.</p>

<p>This means that the availability of aircraft for ‘securing our</p>

<p>vital communications and interrupting those of the enemy’ is</p>

<p>dependent upon the requirements of Operational Training Units and</p>

<p>Bomber Command.</p>

<p>This can hardly be said to be in accordance with the priorities</p>

<p>laid down.</p>

<p>As a result of the proposals contained in the Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>report the hope is expressed that it may be possible ‘to work up</p>

<p>to a maximum of 50 sorties a week’. Can this possibly be regarded</p>

<p>as a serious attempt to grapple with what is probably the most</p>

<p>serious menace with which we have ever been faced?</p>

<p>In dealing with the Indian Ocean area the Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>‘recognise the importance of meeting the requirements for</p>

<p>reconnaissance and striking force in the Indian Ocean as soon as</p>

<p>possible as on this will depend our ability to transfer the</p>

<p>Eastern Fleet to the Pacific or elsewhere’. Nothing could be more</p>

<p>important ‘for securing our vital communications and interrupting</p>

<p>those of the enemy’ in these waters than such transfer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Chiefs of Staff do not propose to start sending</p>

<p>long range reconnaissance aircraft to Ceylon until October.</p>

<p>The reason for this delay appears to be a reluctance to permit</p>

<p>even a temporary weakening of Bomber Command. It seems that the</p>

<p>requirements of Coastal Command for long range general</p>

<p>reconnaissance aircraft will not be fully supplied until October,</p>

<p>and that its immediate needs will be met from time to time by</p>

<p>drawing on Bomber Command. When Coastal Command’s own aircraft</p>

<p>eventually become available those borrowed from Bomber Command</p>

<p>will have been returned-the latter Command thus remaining</p>

<p>undepleted. At this stage the needs of the Indian Ocean area</p>

<p>commence to be met but, I suggest, this is a complete reversal of</p>

<p>the priorities upon which the Chiefs of Staff say they were</p>

<p>working in preparing their report.</p>

<p>While others could be given the above examples are sufficient to</p>

<p>illustrate my contention that the Chiefs of Staff in their</p>

<p>conclusions and recommendations are in conflict with priorities</p>

<p>they set out at the beginning of their paper as those under which</p>

<p>they are working.</p>

<p>The inconsistencies I have referred to are probably due either to</p>

<p>one or the other of two causes. These are that the Chiefs of Staff</p>

<p>Committee being composed of men representative of different</p>

<p>Services only found it possible to overcome their different points</p>

<p>of view by compromise, or that the Government policy was not in</p>

<p>accordance with the priorities which they had laid down in</p>

<p>interpretation of Memorandum W.W.I.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, I suggest that the proper approach to a</p>

<p>solution would be for Cabinet formally to adopt those priorities</p>

<p>and to direct that a further report be submitted in accordance</p>

<p>with them. Such report should set out the whole problem and give</p>

<p>all the necessary information and facts which the War Cabinet will</p>

<p>require in order to arrive at its decision; it should also show,</p>

<p>without regard to the effect upon our air offensive in other</p>

<p>directions, what would be necessary to safeguard our sea</p>

<p>communications and how rapidly those measures could be carried</p>

<p>out.</p>

<p>Having that picture before us we can then consider the effect the</p>

<p>taking of such action would have upon our offensive power, e.g.</p>

<p>bombing Germany. For example, if our present plans contemplate</p>

<p>bombing sorties on Germany on the scale of 1500 a week rising to</p>

<p>2500 a week over the next few months, with an increasing number of</p>

<p>full scale attacks of 1000 planes and over, to what extent would</p>

<p>these estimates be diminished if priority were given to the</p>

<p>ascertained air requirements for securing our sea communications?</p>

<p>My own impression is that while the scale of our offensive may</p>

<p>possibly be reduced over the next few months and the point when we</p>

<p>would reach our maximum effort be delayed to a certain extent, the</p>

<p>reduction and delay would not be such as seriously to imperil the</p>

<p>effectiveness of our efforts.</p>

<p>Until we have all the facts before us, however, it is impossible</p>

<p>to determine what our policy should be. With the facts before us</p>

<p>we can decide between the relative claims of the security of our</p>

<p>sea routes and the offensive against Germany, and determine our</p>

<p>policy so as to achieve the best results.</p>

<p>I also suggest that the question of the security of sea</p>

<p>communications is of such importance to all the United Nations</p>

<p>that having cleared our own minds and adjusted our own</p>

<p>dispositions we should then approach the United States of America</p>

<p>with a view to laying down a common policy to be implemented by a</p>

<p>common effort.</p>

<p>I attach hereto copy of a Note which I forwarded to the Prime</p>

<p>Minister on the 16th June dealing with some aspects of this</p>

<p>problem. [4]</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Bruce forwarded a copy of this paper to Bridges on 30 July with</p>

<p>a request that it be distributed to members of War Cabinet (see</p>

<p>letter on file AA:M100, July 1942). Under the number W.P. (42) 326</p>

<p>it was discussed by War Cabinet on 12 August (see Document 21).</p>

<p>2 The document was indeed a compromise, reached after Portal had</p>

<p>rejected an earlier report prepared by Brind and Slessor. See</p>

<p>Document 5, note 1.</p>

<p>3 This document defined the ‘beat Hitler first’ strategy agreed to</p>

<p>by Churchill and Roosevelt in December 1941. The text had been</p>

<p>transmitted to the Commonwealth Govt in cablegram ET31 of 28 May</p>

<p>(on file AA: A4764, 2).</p>
