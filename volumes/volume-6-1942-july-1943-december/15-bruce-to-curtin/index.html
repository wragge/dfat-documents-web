<p>Cablegram 122[A] LONDON, 2 August 1942, 11 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL HIMSELF ONLY</p>

<p>Following is note referred to in my immediately preceding telegram</p>

<p>121[A] [1]:-</p>

<p>‘In the course of a short conversation with the Prime Minister</p>

<p>this evening, after dealing with matters upon which I was seeing</p>

<p>him, some reference was made to the question of our representation</p>

<p>in the War Cabinet. As the Prime Minister stated with some</p>

<p>emphasis that, “His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and</p>

<p>Northern Ireland” must have the right to sit alone, and referred</p>

<p>to the impending arrival of an Indian representative and Nash’s</p>

<p>presence, it is fairly clear how his mind is working. He</p>

<p>visualizes the presence at meetings of War Cabinet of permanent</p>

<p>representatives of India and Australia, plus representatives of</p>

<p>other Dominions from time to time and possibly all together. This</p>

<p>is an impossible picture and illustrates the point on which I</p>

<p>differed from Page [2] when the question of our representation in</p>

<p>War Cabinet was in the melting pot. Page was endeavouring to</p>

<p>create a system under which a representative of each Dominion</p>

<p>would sit in the United Kingdom War Cabinet. This to my mind was a</p>

<p>quite unworkable proposition. I felt, however, that an immediate</p>

<p>crisis with Australia consequent upon demand for a voice in the</p>

<p>higher direction of the war following on Japan’s initial successes</p>

<p>might be overcome if an offer was made to the Dominions of a</p>

<p>representative in War Cabinet but only Australia accepted. Knowing</p>

<p>the attitude of Mackenzie King and Smuts this seemed a reasonably</p>

<p>safe bet. Fraser was the only doubtful quantity, not because he</p>

<p>wanted a representative in the War Cabinet, but because he might</p>

<p>feel impelled to insist on one if an Australian representative was</p>

<p>appointed.</p>

<p>In the result all went well as no Dominion other than Australia</p>

<p>asked for a representative in War Cabinet. On this basis it seemed</p>

<p>to me possible that the arrangement might work.</p>

<p>An examination of what Australia was asking, and what the Prime</p>

<p>Minister here promised, makes it clear that there were great</p>

<p>difficulties to be overcome if what was visualized in the exchange</p>

<p>of telegrams between the Prime Ministers here and in Australia was</p>

<p>to be realized in practice. [3] When Evatt arrived at the</p>

<p>beginning of May, it was clear that the arrangement had not</p>

<p>achieved what was hoped from it. This view Evatt held strongly and</p>

<p>he told me that in conversation he had with the Prime Minister at</p>

<p>Chequers on the Friday before he left, he had explained to the</p>

<p>Prime Minister the whole position and enlisted his co-operation in</p>

<p>putting it right. [4]</p>

<p>On this understanding I agreed to become Australia’s accredited</p>

<p>representative and set out my understanding of my task in my cable</p>

<p>to the Prime Minister No. S.34 of 4th June (copy attached</p>

<p>herewith). [5]</p>

<p>(Note:-From copy of this telegram (S.34) I withheld the sentence</p>

<p>with regard to the position of United Kingdom members of War</p>

<p>Cabinet.)</p>

<p>Since I undertook the responsibilities of Australia’s accredited</p>

<p>representative I have been trying quietly to improve the position</p>

<p>and was not without hope of eventual success. The visit of the</p>

<p>American representatives last week to discuss the broad strategy</p>

<p>of the war placed me in a considerable difficulty. I heard of this</p>

<p>visit when the Prime Minister announced it to the Cabinet on</p>

<p>Monday 20th July. As by Thursday I had not been summoned to any</p>

<p>meeting of War Cabinet either with regard to instructions to be</p>

<p>given to the Chiefs of Staff or to consider the results of their</p>

<p>discussions with Marshall and King, I felt that I should advise</p>

<p>the Government of the position and drafted the cable of 23rd July</p>

<p>[6] (copy attached herewith). This telegram I decided to think</p>

<p>over during the night and as I was summoned to a War Cabinet</p>

<p>meeting on Friday I decided to postpone sending it until after the</p>

<p>meeting. As a result of discussion at the meeting I decided not to</p>

<p>send the telegram. For it I substituted my telegram 111[A] of 25th</p>

<p>July (copy of which is attached herewith) [7] together with other telegrams I have sent on the subject of Hopkins, Marshall and</p>

<p>King’s Visit. [8]</p>

<p>Although the immediate problem created by the visit of American</p>

<p>representatives has passed the major question of implementation of</p>

<p>the arrangement with regard to our representation in War Cabinet</p>

<p>remains unsettled. The only hope of satisfactorily dealing with</p>

<p>this problem is by personal discussion between the Prime Minister</p>

<p>and myself</p>

<p>I am convinced that the Prime Minister is anxious to find an</p>

<p>effective means of honouring the obligation which he has</p>

<p>undertaken. The only solution which I can see is for the</p>

<p>Australian representative to take part in formulation of all major</p>

<p>questions of policy. If this, or some other arrangement that will</p>

<p>be reasonably satisfactory both to the United Kingdom Government</p>

<p>and Australian Government, cannot be acceded to, there appears to</p>

<p>be no alternative but to declare frankly that the contemplated</p>

<p>basis of Australian representation in the War Cabinet is</p>

<p>unworkable. The latter course would have most unfortunate results</p>

<p>and every effort of good sense and good will must be made to avoid</p>

<p>it.’</p>

<p>Note:-The draft telegram not sent which I refer to above I am</p>

<p>forwarding in my immediately following telegram 123[A]. [9]</p>
