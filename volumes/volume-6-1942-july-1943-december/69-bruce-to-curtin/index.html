<p>Cablegram 179[A] LONDON, 1 November 1942, 8.36 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE MOST CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>My telegram 178[A]. [1]</p>

<p>No further information yet obtained as to why telegram from Chief of the Imperial General Staff to the Commander-in-Chief referred to in my telegram No. 173[A] [2] had apparently not reached the Commander-in-Chief when Morshead saw him on October 27th. [3]</p>

<p>The Chief of the Imperial General Staff’s telegram was despatched on 23rd October and advised the Commander-in-Chief that no further reinforcements were coming forward for the 9th Division and that the Division was not to be broken up. It did not preclude the Commander-in-Chief from utilising the Division within these limits in the present offensive. Such utilisation was foreshadowed in my telegram No. 171[A] of 20th October [4] and is referred to in paragraph (2) of Winch No. 26. [5] I am, however, not quite clear as to your attitude with regard to the utilisation of the Division and in order to avoid any misunderstanding I set out below the position as I see it.</p>

<p>1. Owing to the situation in the South-Western Pacific and of</p>

<p>Australian manpower, you felt it necessary to require the return of the 9th Division to Australia.</p>

<p>2. This decision you conveyed in your telegram 461 of 17th October to the Dominions Office in which you set out fully the reasons that had led you to take it. [6]</p>

<p>3. When this telegram arrived, the offensive which is now proceeding and in which the 9th Division has been allocated a vital role was on the eve of being launched.</p>

<p>4. The withdrawal of the 9th Division would at this stage have meant the abandonment of the operation.</p>

<p>5. The imminence of this operation I conveyed to you in my telegram No. 171[A] of 20th October, and in your 9684 of 22nd October [7] you stressed that in the use of the Division, the Commander-in-Chief should have regard to the fact that no further reinforcements were being sent.</p>

<p>6. The position now is that the offensive has been launched with initial success, in considerable measure due to the work of the 9th Division.</p>

<p>7. Alexander in his conversation with Morshead has made it clear that the retention of the 9th Division in the operations is essential to their continued success.</p>

<p>8. In view of this and the paramount importance of the present operations in the Middle East I am presuming that you agree to the continued utilisation of the 9th Division until such time as the operational situation permits its withdrawal with a view to its return to Australia and subject to the same conditions as in respect to the original offensive, i.e. that the Commander-in- Chief in using it has regard to the fact that no further reinforcements will be sent from Australia and that the Division must not be broken up.</p>

<p>Please advise urgently whether my interpretation of your attitude is correct.</p>

<p>BRUCE</p>
