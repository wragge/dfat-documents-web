                          <p>Cablegram 234 LONDON, 2 July 1940, 5 a.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET</p>

<p>War Cabinet this morning considered the Far Eastern situation and</p>

<p>had before it your telegram 27th June No. 330 [1] for which we are</p>

<p>much obliged.</p>

<p>After full consideration the War Cabinet came to the conclusion</p>

<p>that it would be desirable to reply as follows to the Japanese</p>

<p>demands.</p>

<p>(a) To agree to the withdrawal of the Shanghai garrison provided</p>

<p>that Italy also withdraws and on the assumption that British lives</p>

<p>and property will be protected and that Japanese Government will</p>

<p>not seek to alter the status of the concession except in</p>

<p>consultation with the parties concerned.</p>

<p>(b) To make enquiry as to the precise grounds for the complaint at</p>

<p>Hong Kong, and,</p>

<p>(c) With regard to the Burmese Road he [2] is to point out that</p>

<p>the passage of arms and ammunition does not offer any very</p>

<p>material contribution to the armed strength of China; that war</p>

<p>material from the United Kingdom has been insignificant in recent</p>

<p>months and that owing to their own war effort His Majesty’s</p>

<p>Government in the United Kingdom are in fact unable to supply</p>

<p>China with munitions of war. As to the stoppage of fuel, fuel oil</p>

<p>and petrol, trucks and railway material, His Majesty’s Government</p>

<p>in the United Kingdom would state that in making this request the</p>

<p>Japanese Government was asking them to take action inconsistent</p>

<p>with their obligation to India and Burma, for whom the Burmese</p>

<p>Road constitutes a legitimate trade route. [Relations] [3] with</p>

<p>the United States would also be affected in as much as the route</p>

<p>is largely used for United States products. It is proposed to [add</p>

<p>that] in strict neutrality a request to cut off these materials</p>

<p>from China should involve a similar stoppage of supplies to Japan</p>

<p>though of course this is in no way the intention.</p>

<p>Finally, it is proposed to say that far from prolonging</p>

<p>hostilities, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have</p>

<p>deplored them and have on various occasions expressed their</p>

<p>readiness, should both parties so desire, to use their endeavours</p>

<p>to bring the conflict to a dose.</p>

<p>In arriving at the above conclusion, His Majesty’s Government in</p>

<p>the United Kingdom have been influenced by the fact that, while it</p>

<p>is obviously desirable to avoid trouble with Japan at this moment,</p>

<p>it is doubtful whether the concessions from [weakness] on points</p>

<p>of principle, apart from other considerations, would bring any</p>

<p>lasting improvement in the Anglo-Japanese relations. Furthermore,</p>

<p>in any attempt to find a way of accommodation with Japan, care</p>

<p>must be taken not to destroy confidence in the United States and</p>

<p>China in the British policy.</p>

<p>As the Commonwealth Government are aware, the United States have</p>

<p>indicated that they are prepared neither to increase pressure</p>

<p>which might involve them in war nor to take the initiative in a</p>

<p>policy of conciliation. On our part we are quite prepared to adopt</p>

<p>the latter policy if it is capable of producing any results. But</p>

<p>the United States Government appear to hold the view, which we are</p>

<p>inclined to share, that the Japanese nation is in no mood to be</p>

<p>weaned from a policy of aggression, and in these circumstances it</p>

<p>seems more than likely that any concessions which we may show</p>

<p>ourselves ready to make will fail to deter Japan from her</p>

<p>objectives.</p>

<p>We are inclined to agree with Sir Robert Craigie that a refusal to</p>

<p>close the Burmese Road will not directly lead to war, and that the</p>

<p>Japanese will in the first place have recourse to less violent</p>

<p>measures. Unless Great Britain were to be defeated in the European</p>

<p>conflict it seems to us doubtful whether Japan would have recourse</p>

<p>to total war. Japan’s resources are not inexhaustible and should</p>

<p>she ultimately resort to hostilities it seems much more probable</p>

<p>that they would be limited and local and that, provided we</p>

<p>ourselves did not declare a state of war, she would terminate them</p>

<p>whenever it became apparent that a further advance would tax her</p>

<p>resources beyond their capacity. If Japan is bent on a policy of</p>

<p>this kind, it is unlikely that anything can be done at this stage</p>

<p>to deflect her. Nevertheless, Sir Robert Craigie has been</p>

<p>authorized to explore the possibilities and if these exist, His</p>

<p>Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will naturally do what</p>

<p>they can in consultation with the Dominion Governments to exploit</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>In the light of the above and in view of the very bad effect which</p>

<p>the closing of the Burmese Road would have upon India, Burma and</p>

<p>Malaya, which would be directly affected, we feel that we should</p>

<p>not close the Burmese Road.</p>

<p>We fully appreciate the considerations advanced by the</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government from the point of view of Australia. It</p>

<p>will be understood that it is necessary for us to take into</p>

<p>account all the relevant factors, and we hope that in the light of</p>

<p>the wider considerations mentioned above, the Commonwealth</p>

<p>Government will feel able to concur in the terms of the reply</p>

<p>which it is proposed to [send] to Japan. We should be grateful for</p>

<p>a very early reply. [4]</p>

<p>We are repeating your telegram and this reply to His Majesty’s</p>

<p>Governments in Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa,</p>

<p>with a request for any observations so far as they are concerned.</p>
