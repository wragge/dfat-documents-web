                          <p>Cablegram 3649 (extract) CANBERRA, 10 July 1941</p>

<p>MOST IMMEDIATE SECRET</p>

<p>For the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. [1]</p>

<p>Prior to the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Russia,</p>

<p>we had been reviewing the position that had been reached in regard</p>

<p>to economic policy towards Japan. We were about to suggest to you</p>

<p>that the various economic measures in operation and in</p>

<p>contemplation be considered in relation to foreign policy, and</p>

<p>that the possible effects on our political relationships with</p>

<p>Japan, and our preparedness for any aggressive move by Japan, be</p>

<p>summed up. [2]</p>

<p>At the time we had before us your proposal that we should reduce</p>

<p>our lead exports to Japan to 2,500 tons annually [3], and we were</p>

<p>also considering the Japanese requests for copra and wheat, and</p>

<p>your views in regard to them. [4] Our general attitude was that we</p>

<p>were prepared to cooperate in regard to these matters, provided</p>

<p>the action proposed was valuable in securing United States co-</p>

<p>operation, and was part of a carefully weighed plan with adequate</p>

<p>safeguards for us. We were, however, apprehensive regarding the</p>

<p>effect of the proposed action on our relations with Japan,</p>

<p>particularly in regard to copra, large quantities of which are</p>

<p>lying on many undefended beaches in the Pacific.</p>

<p>When Germany attacked Russia, we suspended action while awaiting</p>

<p>developments. Since then we have studied with interest your</p>

<p>several telegrams on the subject [5], and have noted your</p>

<p>instructions to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tokyo. [6] You mention</p>

<p>in your telegram of 4th July, Circular D.396, that the Japanese</p>

<p>Embassy have pressed the request for copra from New Guinea, and</p>

<p>have referred to the effect of the closing of the Siberian railway</p>

<p>on the possibility of re-export. The Japanese Minister in</p>

<p>Australia has made a similar request to us. [7]</p>

<p>The Australian Minister at Tokyo has expressed to us views similar</p>

<p>to those forwarded to you by His Majesty’s Ambassador. Sir John</p>

<p>Latham recently advised us that, while there is a strong case on</p>

<p>economic grounds for the restrictions on further food supplies, a</p>

<p>political assessment of the position must have regard to the fact</p>

<p>that the Japanese people are short of rice, wheat and food oil.</p>

<p>Our Minister points out that it would be possible to work up</p>

<p>indignation against the Empire for denying supplies in view of the</p>

<p>fact that Netherlands East Indies and United States are allowing</p>

<p>supplies of oil and wheat to go to Japan. [8] (We know of course</p>

<p>that the exports of copra from Netherlands East Indies are very</p>

<p>small, but we are not clear regarding current exports from</p>

<p>Philippine Islands.)</p>

<p>While our Minister advises us to permit small supplies of</p>

<p>foodstuffs to go forward, we are trying to postpone a decision as</p>

<p>long as possible. In the meantime we would very much appreciate</p>

<p>advice whether, in deciding on measures against Japan in the</p>

<p>sphere of economic warfare, you feel that we must take a chance as</p>

<p>to Japan’s reactions, which may be bitter and may appear well</p>

<p>founded, and whether you consider that effective means of</p>

<p>countering any aggressive action by Japan are available, including</p>

<p>United States collaboration. In this regard we have noted the</p>

<p>relevant portion of your telegram of 6th July, Circular D.399. [9]</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>MENZIES</p>

<p>1 Lord Cranborne.</p>

<p>2 For previous interdepartmental discussion along these lines see</p>

<p>file AA : A981, Far East 20B, i.</p>

<p>3 See Cranborne’s cablegram 391 of 2 June on the file cited in</p>

<p>note 2.</p>

<p>4 See Documents on Australian Foreign Policy 1937-49, vol. IV,</p>

<p>Documents 482 and 502; and file AA : A981, Japan 152 for telegrams</p>

<p>from Tatsuo Kawai (Japanese Minister to Australia) to Sir Earle</p>

<p>Page (Minister for Commerce) on 8 May and to A. W. Fadden (Acting</p>

<p>Prime Minister) on 12 and 17 May.</p>

<p>5 See circular cablegrams D378 and D379 of 27 June and D396 and</p>

<p>D397 of 4 July on the file cited in note 2.</p>

<p>6 In circular cablegram D396 the U.K. Govt bad advised the</p>

<p>Commonwealth Govt of its intimation to Sir Robert Craigie in Tokyo</p>

<p>that there would be no relaxation of economic restrictions while</p>

<p>Japan remained an Axis member. Lord Cranborne reaffirmed this</p>

<p>policy in his reply to cablegram 3649. See cablegram 478 of 12</p>

<p>July on file AA : A1608, G59/1/3, ii.</p>

<p>7 Kawai’s letter of 27 June to Menzies is on the file cited in</p>

<p>note 4.</p>

<p>8 For Latham’s views see Documents on Australian Foreign Policy</p>

<p>1937 49, vol. IV, Document 518.</p>

<p>9 The fifth paragraph of cablegram D399 (on file AA : A981, Far</p>

<p>East 21) referred to an assurance given recently by Sumner Welles</p>

<p>(U.S. Acting Secretary of State) that if Japan embarked on</p>

<p>hostilities either to the north or south the U.S. Govt would</p>

<p>immediately apply all pressure at its command.</p>
