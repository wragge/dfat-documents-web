<p>Circular cablegram M151 LONDON, 12 July 1941, 11.51 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>Following for Prime Minister.</p>

<p>My Circular M.140. [1]</p>

<p>JAPAN</p>

<p>Possible denunciation of Commercial Treaty [2] in the event of</p>

<p>further southward movement by Japan was one of the suggestions</p>

<p>upon which the views of Dominion Governments were invited in my</p>

<p>telegram D.182 of April 5th. [3] Main points made in the replies</p>

<p>received to those suggestions were: -</p>

<p>(1) The importance of suiting the action to the circumstances as</p>

<p>they arise and avoiding provocative measures which might do more</p>

<p>harm than good.</p>

<p>(2) The importance of securing United States co-operation in any</p>

<p>retaliatory measures which might be contemplated.</p>

<p>As regards the Commercial Treaty the general view expressed was</p>

<p>that in the circumstances envisaged, denunciation might have</p>

<p>little to commend development [sic] except from the point of view</p>

<p>of bringing us into line with the United States. The Canadian</p>

<p>Government for their part expressed doubts as to the wisdom of</p>

<p>such action if taken as a reprisal and suggested that it might be</p>

<p>preferable if notice of termination could be given in a moment of</p>

<p>comparative calm. The Commonwealth Government felt that there was</p>

<p>some risk of denunciation being regarded as an irritant and</p>

<p>suggested that counter action in the economic sphere could more</p>

<p>effectively be provided by the adoption of joint policy of import</p>

<p>restrictions in co-operation with the United States Government.</p>

<p>[4] Alternatively the suggestion put forward in my telegram that</p>

<p>the situation might best be met by placing Mitsui, Mitsubishi or</p>

<p>Okura on the Black or Statutory List was felt to have [sic] rise</p>

<p>to strong objections at least as far as the two former companies</p>

<p>are concerned and was generally viewed with disfavour.</p>

<p>(2) We have given most careful consideration to these views and</p>

<p>suggestions of re-examining possible courses of action open to us.</p>

<p>In deciding to recommend denunciation of the Commercial Treaty</p>

<p>notwithstanding doubts previously expressed, we have been</p>

<p>influenced by the manner in which the situation has developed in</p>

<p>the last few months and by the need for meeting any further</p>

<p>Japanese move by a measure which could both be put into effect</p>

<p>without delay and would at the same time afford unmistakable</p>

<p>evidence of our reactions. We fully recognise that the practical</p>

<p>importance of this step would be small but do not consider that it</p>

<p>could be regarded as provocative. On the other hand we have reason</p>

<p>to believe that the psychological effects in Japan would be</p>

<p>greater and would bring home especially to the trading community</p>

<p>the perils of bad leadership. This has also been the opinion of</p>

<p>His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tokyo. [5] We further consider it most</p>

<p>important to bring ourselves fully into line with the United</p>

<p>States in this matter.</p>

<p>(3) We very much hope therefore that on reconsideration His</p>

<p>Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions will feel able to concur in</p>

<p>our taking this step as soon as the moment is judged opportune.</p>

<p>Although we should wish to proceed with denunciation of the treaty</p>

<p>at very short interval after the Japanese move into Southern Indo-</p>

<p>China we agree with the view previously expressed by the Canadian</p>

<p>Government that it should not be represented as a reprisal and</p>

<p>would propose that notice should be based on the grounds that</p>

<p>Japanese restrictions on British trade and changing conditions</p>

<p>have made continuation of the treaty pointless.</p>

<p>(4) A very early reply would be appreciated since the latest</p>

<p>indications are that the Japanese move may be imminent. As to the</p>

<p>general United States attitude please see my circular M.149 of</p>

<p>today. [6]</p>

<p>In the meantime we are further exploring the possibilities in the</p>

<p>direction of import restrictions as suggested by the Commonwealth</p>

<p>Government but the matter is complicated by the varying conditions</p>

<p>of parts of the Empire and it is clear that the preparation of</p>

<p>suitable scheme would not [be?] free from difficulty. His</p>

<p>Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington [7] is however being asked to</p>

<p>elicit view of United States authorities as to the prospects of</p>

<p>their being able to co-operate in this field.</p>
