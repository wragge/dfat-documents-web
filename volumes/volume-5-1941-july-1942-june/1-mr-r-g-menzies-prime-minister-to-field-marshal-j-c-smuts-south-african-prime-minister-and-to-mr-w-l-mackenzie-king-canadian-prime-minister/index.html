                          <p>Cablegram 46/2 [1] CANBERRA, 3 July [1941]</p>

<p>MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL</p>

<p>I have been much exercised about the relations of the Dominions to</p>

<p>the important matter of central control of war policy.</p>

<p>We all have the greatest admiration for the genius, personality</p>

<p>and work of Churchill, but I was greatly struck in London by the</p>

<p>following facts: -</p>

<p>1.Churchill carries far too great an individual burden, and this</p>

<p>has obvious dangers in a long war;</p>

<p>2.The constitution of the War Cabinet is such that members of it</p>

<p>have much departmental work, involving heavy pre-occupation with</p>

<p>detail. For example, Beaverbrook has the far-reaching portfolio of</p>

<p>Supply, Bevin the complex problems of the Labour Department, and</p>

<p>Kingsley Wood the Exchequer. This inevitably means that such</p>

<p>Ministers have little time for the perusal of major reports,</p>

<p>access to the heads of the Fighting Services, and those studies</p>

<p>and reflections which are necessary to see the war and the world</p>

<p>as a whole.</p>

<p>3.Under the existing system, I frankly think that there is</p>

<p>inadequate consideration of long range policy in relation to the</p>

<p>winning of the war, an insufficiently comprehensive view of how</p>

<p>the productive capacity of the Empire and the United States can be</p>

<p>marshalled for the best results, and an unsatisfactory direction</p>

<p>of foreign policy, which can at a time like this no longer be left</p>

<p>to one Minister, but should represent the joint wisdom and</p>

<p>decision of an authoritative Cabinet.</p>

<p>4.Apart from an occasional visit by a Dominions Prime Minister</p>

<p>there has been an absence of effective consultation with the</p>

<p>Dominions to elicit their point of view in regard to major</p>

<p>questions of policy. This is in no sense intentional but results</p>

<p>naturally from the fact that the Dominions Secretary [2] is not a</p>

<p>member of the War Cabinet or the Defence Committee and is</p>

<p>therefore little more than a channel of communication.</p>

<p>5.Churchill being absorbed for long hours every day in the</p>

<p>supremely important tasks of strategy and the leading and</p>

<p>stimulating of the public mind, financial and economic questions</p>

<p>which are of vast importance not only now but in the post war</p>

<p>period tend to slip into the background and to have somewhat</p>

<p>spasmodic attention.</p>

<p>I am strongly of the opinion that there should be a War Cabinet in</p>

<p>the real sense, meeting daily, thinking out and discussing large</p>

<p>matters, and in which Churchill would have constructively critical</p>

<p>colleagues who, being free of minor activities, would be able to</p>

<p>give him the support and advice which even the greatest man must</p>

<p>have if he is to reach his highest effectiveness.</p>

<p>In such a Cabinet I believe that a Dominions Prime Minister</p>

<p>should, if one is available, have a place. In the absence of such</p>

<p>an arrangement, we will find ourselves conferring by cable, with</p>

<p>all the attendant delays and ambiguities about matters which</p>

<p>require constant consideration and prompt decision.</p>

<p>You will, I am sure, share my feeling that these matters are of</p>

<p>the first importance if we are to avoid from time to time a state</p>

<p>of affairs which may create real difficulties, particularly of</p>

<p>public opinion, in the various Empire countries.</p>

<p>I frankly recognise the complexities of the problem.</p>

<p>TO FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS ONLY:</p>

<p>Your own superb work in South Africa fills me with unqualified</p>

<p>admiration, but it may be that the nature of your problems will</p>

<p>not permit a long absence from your own country. I hope that this</p>

<p>is not so.</p>

<p>TO MR. MACKENZIE KING ONLY:</p>

<p>I well remember our discussion on these matters when I had the</p>

<p>honour of seeing you at Ottawa, and I know your own problems and</p>

<p>point of view.</p>

<p>CONTINUE TO BOTH:-Nevertheless, I feel that if we could all be in</p>

<p>London at the one time for a short meeting of Dominion Prime</p>

<p>Ministers we could jointly exercise a powerful influence in the</p>

<p>re-shaping of the machinery of central control and out of such a</p>

<p>conference we might be able to evolve not some practical</p>

<p>impossibility like an Imperial War Cabinet but effective Dominions</p>

<p>representation in a British War Cabinet, reduced in size and so</p>

<p>constituted as to bring about the results of which I have written</p>

<p>above.</p>

<p>Please do not think that in making these suggestions I am in any</p>

<p>way proposing something which would be calculated to weaken the</p>

<p>position or authority of the leader. On the contrary, I feel that</p>

<p>he is so outstanding and important to all of us that he must be</p>

<p>given the greatest possible help in such a way as to secure the</p>

<p>maximum united effort on the part of all British countries.</p>

<p>There is some reason to believe that Fraser [3] could be induced</p>

<p>to remain in London until the end of August. My own political</p>

<p>difficulties are considerable, since I have a practically non-</p>

<p>existent majority, but I would be prepared to take any political</p>

<p>risk at home if by going to London for the suggested conference I</p>

<p>could contribute to what I feel is an essential change.</p>

<p>I would be glad to have quite confidentially to myself your own</p>

<p>impressions on these matters. [4]</p>

<p>Kindest regards.</p>

<p>I have communicated in similar terms with Mr. Mackenzie King/Field</p>

<p>Marshal Smuts.</p>

<p>MENZIES</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>1 Repeated to the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom as no</p>

<p>3465.</p>

<p>2 Lord Cranborne.</p>

<p>3 N.Z. Prime Minister.</p>

<p>4 Smuts replied on 10 July (cablegram 40, AA : A3195, 1941,</p>

<p>[1.12021]) that although he agreed that the holding of an Imperial</p>

<p>war conference in London would be highly desirable he could not</p>

<p>leave South Africa until later in the year. He doubted the wisdom</p>

<p>of including a Dominion Prime Minister as a permanent member of</p>

<p>the U.K. War Cabinet and made it clear that he believed it was</p>

<p>Churchill’s right to decide the membership of that body. He also</p>

<p>pointed out that because of the campaigns in Africa and the Middle</p>

<p>East and the possibility of war in the Far East there was less</p>

<p>reason to concentrate war leadership in London than there had been</p>

<p>in the First World War.</p>

<p>Mackenzie King replied on 2 August (cablegram 2, AA : A3195, 1941,</p>

<p>1.14055) that commitments in Canada ruled out any possibility of</p>

<p>his attending a protracted Imperial war conference or joining an</p>

<p>Imperial war cabinet. He believed that the existing machinery for</p>

<p>consultation between the U.K. and Dominion Govts was adequate,</p>

<p>that there was not a clearly defined ‘Dominions’ as opposed to</p>

<p>‘United Kingdom’ viewpoint which could be satisfactorily</p>

<p>represented in London by one Dominion Prime Minister and that</p>

<p>although the individual burden carried by Churchill was far too</p>

<p>great he could only be relieved of it by his own action or by that</p>

<p>of the British Parliament and people. The cablegram is published</p>

<p>in Documents on Canadian External Relations, vol. VII, Department</p>

<p>of External Affairs, Ottawa, 1974, Document 588.</p>
