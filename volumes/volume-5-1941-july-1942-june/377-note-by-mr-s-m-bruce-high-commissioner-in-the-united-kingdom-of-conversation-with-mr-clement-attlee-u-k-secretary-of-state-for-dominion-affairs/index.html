Bruce, High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, of Conversation with Mr Clement Attlee, U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs</h1>

<p>_</p>

<p>I saw Attlee this afternoon and told him I was very concerned at the obvious strained relations that were growing up between the United Kingdom Government and the Australian Government. [1]</p>

<p>I said quite frankly that Winston’s attitude was one of extreme annoyance with the Australian Government and an attitude that they were taking up an impossible and unreasonable position.</p>

<p>I suggested that this was not the situation but that the Australian Government definitely believed that there was no true appreciation here of the importance of Australia as a base or adequate plans for reinforcing it and consequently they felt compelled to insist on the return of their own Divisions.</p>

<p>Attlee did not challenge my description of Winston’s attitude but expressed every desire to get rid of the present friction.</p>

<p>I put to him that the way that could be brought about was by showing Australia that there was a real appreciation of the defence of Australia as a great base in the Pacific and the jumping off spot for a counter offensive against the Japanese when the time came.</p>

<p>To convince Australia of this it was necessary to show them that there was a definite plan for the reinforcement of Australia and the time and manner in which it was contemplated to carry it out.</p>

<p>I put it to Attlee that if accompanying the proposal for the diversion of the 7th Division to Burma there had been information of any such plan, I felt that the reply from the Government in Australia would have been very different.</p>

<p>Attlee quite realised this and said that there was no doubt but that the importance of Australia as a base was fully recognised and was at this moment the subject matter of an exchange of views between the Chiefs of Staff and the Chiefs of Staff Committee in Washington.</p>

<p>I admitted that that was probably true but I stressed the necessity for getting the machinery working more rapidly and more efficiently. I said a good deal on this subject, from none of which Attlee dissented. It is another question, however, whether he will take any action to bring about the desired result.</p>
