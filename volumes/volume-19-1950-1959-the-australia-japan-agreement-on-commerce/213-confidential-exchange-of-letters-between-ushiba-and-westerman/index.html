<h2 id="18th-june-1957">18th June, 1957</h2>

<p>CANBERRA</p>

<p><strong>1. With Reference to Wheat Quality</strong></p>

<p>Dear Dr Westerman, In the course of our discussions about soft wheat, the Japanese Delegation has noted that the Australian Wheat Board is prepared to work out with Japanese importers a special arrangement with regard to a guarantee of quality of Australian f.a.q. wheat.</p>

<p>The Japanese Delegation suggests that should any difficulties arise in connection with the quality of f.a.q. wheat, the two Governments should consult together with the object of devising procedures to remove such difficulties.</p>

<p>I would welcome your reaction to this proposal.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, NOBUHIKO USHIBA</p>

<p>Dear Mr Ushiba, In response to your letter of today regarding the quality of Australian wheat imported into Japan, I wish to inform you that the Australian Government is agreeable to your suggestion that, should any difficulties arise in connection with the quality of f.a.q. wheat, representatives of the two Governments should consult.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, W.A. WESTERMAN</p>

<p><strong>2. With Reference to Consultations on Wheat</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr Ushiba, It is the understanding of the Australian Delegation that if, during the currency of the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan, under conditions of normal competition the market for Australian wheat in Japan appears to be declining, the Japanese Government, at the request of the Australian Government, would be willing to discuss the marketing problems which appeared to be limiting Australian wheat imports and to co-operate in examining steps which might be taken to improve the position.</p>

<p>I would welcome your confirmation of this understanding.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, W.A. WESTERMAN</p>

<p>Dear Dr Westerman, In response to your letter of today regarding consultations on wheat, I wish to confirm that in the circumstances outlined, the Japanese Government would be ready to consult on the marketing problems confronting imports of Australian wheat into Japan. Yours faithfully, NOBUHIKO USHIBA</p>

<p><strong>3. With Reference to Surplus Disposals</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr Ushiba, I confirm my advice to you that the Australian Government has taken a very active interest in the question of disposal of agricultural surpluses by the Government of the United States of America. It would be similarly concerned in respect of disposal of agricultural surpluses by any other Government.</p>

<p>The Australian Government would be glad if you could confirm the understanding that the Japanese Government would on request at any time be ready to consult with the Australian Government and exchange information concerning a noncommercial arrangement on agricultural commodities.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, W.A. WESTERMAN</p>

<p>Dear Dr Westerman, In response to your letter of today regarding disposals of surplus commodities, I wish to confirm that the Japanese Government would be ready on request at any time to consult with the Australian Government and to exchange information concerning a non-commercial arrangement on agricultural commodities.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, NOBUHIKO USHIBA</p>

<p><strong>4. With Reference to the Confidential Nature of Certain Documents</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr Ushiba, It is our understanding that with respect to the Draft Agreement on Commerce between the Commonwealth of Australia and Japan initialled today, information made public or conveyed to other Governments will be confined to official press statements made on behalf of either Government. This understanding would apply pending the signature and release of the final text of the Agreement.</p>

<p>It is also our understanding that after the signature and release of the final text of the Agreement, the text or the substance of those parts of the Agreement or related documents (including minutes of plenary meetings) which it has been agreed shall not be made public will not be conveyed to other Governments and will not be published or publicly commented on without prior consultation between our two Governments.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your confirmation of this understanding.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, W.A. WESTERMAN</p>

<p>Dear Dr Westerman, I refer to your letter of today regarding the confidential nature of the Draft Agreement on Commerce between Japan and the Commonwealth of Australia signed today, and of certain sections of the final Agreement.</p>

<p>I wish to confirm the understanding set out in your letter.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, NOBUHIKO USHIBA</p>
