<p>Djakarta, 18 August 1967</p>

<p>38. Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Refugees from West Irian</strong></p>

<p>During discussion of aid and other matters with Malik on 18th August I brought the subject round to West Irian, including the matter of refugees crossing into TPNG from West Irian. I said that while on leave in Canberra I had found that this problem, and other matters relating to our joint border with Indonesia were being given the Government’s closest attention, it being appreciated that constant care and goodwill would be necessary to avoid misunderstandings between Australia and lndonesia.1</p>

<p>2. I reviewed with Malik our previous discussions, particularly following the sudden increase in border-crossings in March of this year. He recalled clearly the Australian intention at that time to keep the matter in as low a key as possible and our policy of returning as many as possible of those who could be persuaded to go back. I went through the figures since, showing the decrease that had occurred, and we both expressed satisfaction that the subject had not made the news recently. Malik said that he had given instructions that no one was to stir up publicity on this subject; when I mentioned the one critical comment that had been made Malik hastened to assure me that he had moved to prevent any recurrence.</p>

<p>3. In discussing our policy of persuading people to return, I pointed out to Malik that we were not completely free agents in that we had to bear in mind international law and practice in respect of the rights of refugees, and I made a single glancing reference to the existence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. I added however that we refrained from using terms like ’political asylum’ and ‘persecution’. Malik said he understood the point and was grateful for the way we were handling things.</p>

<p>4. I said that I hoped that if any problem arose involving refugees, either in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or among Malik’s colleagues, the Indonesians would discuss it privately with us rather than making the issue public. This would either solve the problem or at least lead to it being presented in the way least damaging to our mutual interests. I said that if, for example, criminals or law breakers fled across the border, we would be interested to have from the Indonesians full details of their crimes so that we could examine what, if anything, could be done to remedy the situation. Malik said this was the right way to handle things.</p>

<p>5. In talking of the problem of refugees, and later on in regard to the 1969 ascertainment in West Irian, I said that the Australian Government wanted Indonesia to know that it harboured no ulterior designs of any kind so far as West Irian was concerned. Malik said he accepted this. Pursuing the point I said that in the light of past history it would be understandable if some people, for example some Army officers who might have been closely concerned with the West Irian campaign, might continue to have suspicions about Australia. Would Malik, if these things came to his notice, disabuse the minds of the doubtful ones-or tell me so that I could explain our bona fides to them. Malik reiterated that he was persuaded and that there was no room for doubt about our motives. In this regard he recalled his frank and satisfactory discussions with Mr Hasluck on the latter’s two previous visits to lndonesia.2</p>
