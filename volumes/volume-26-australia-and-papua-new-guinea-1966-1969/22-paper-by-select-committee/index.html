<p>Port Moresby, undated</p>

<p><strong>Matters for discussion with Commonwealth Government</strong></p>

<p>As a result of the deliberations of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development it has become apparent that because of the nature of some of the questions raised it would be most advisable for certain matters to be the subject of talks between the Commonwealth Government and the Committee.</p>

<p>It is appreciated that at this stage such talks will be purely of an exploratory nature but they would serve to give an indication of the trend of thinking on certain aspects which are of concern to the Committee in its investigations. The matters which the Committee consider should be raised have all been the subject of discussions and have been canvassed among members.</p>

<p>It is felt that before an approach is made to the peoples of Papua and New Guinea it is essential that the views of the Commonwealth Government on these aspects should be sought so that the Committee will be better informed when such approach is made.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the draft questionnaire, which is attached, proposes various alternatives and should any of these be unacceptable to the Government, the Committee would wish to be informed as it considers that the submission of such unacceptable propositions to the people could create unfortunate reactions. The questionnaire is only in draft form and will not be finalized until after the discussions have been held, when it will be reviewed in the light of suggestions made and information given by the Commonwealth Government.</p>

<p>It is essential that we should know the extent to which the Commonwealth Government is prepared to go and its thinking on the matters raised, and any other matters which it feels germane to the subject, would be of inestimable value to the Committee which accepts that these talks should be on a confidential basis.</p>

<p>The Committee wishes to express its appreciation to the Honourable the Minister for making these talks possible.</p>

<p><em>Matters for discussion</em></p>

<p>(1) In the event of the people deciding that they wish Papua and New Guinea to be one country, the following alternatives arise—</p>

<p>(a) that Papua becomes a Trust Territory with New Guinea and Papuans become Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens; or</p>

<p>(b) that New Guinea becomes an Australian Territory and New Guineans acquire Australian citizenship rather than a status of Australian protected persons; or</p>

<p>(c) that there be a Papuan and New Guinean citizenship.</p>

<p>The views of the Commonwealth Government are sought on these alternatives, so that the Committee may be aware as to which would be acceptable or unacceptable. In the event of any of these alternatives being acceptable to the people, it is anticipated that there would also be a desire to continue close association with Australia. The Commonwealth Government’s views as to the extent of such an association is sought.</p>

<p>(2) Could a statement be made on the application of Commonwealth migration provisions in relation to the peoples of the Territory in the event of any of the alternative forms of citizenship status mentioned above being achieved?</p>

<p>(3) Does the Commonwealth Government consider that a period of internal self-government is desirable before other major changes in constitutional development occur?</p>

<p>(4) In the event of an interim system of internal self-government being established and having in mind the responsibilities which will necessarily have to be assumed by the Legislature, has the Commonwealth Government any views on an acceptable system that could be adopted, taking into account the present development of the indigenous people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the desire to vest in Under-Secretaries or some similar office and the Administrator’ s Council or similar body, a greater participation in the Government of the Territory? The Committee feels that any such system should ensure that the best advice possible, whether of a technical nature or on matters of policy, is still available to the Administrator who remains responsible for the administration of the Territory and the carrying out of Commonwealth Government policy so long as Australia provides major financial assistance.</p>

<p>(5) Has the Commonwealth Government any views as to whether there should be a form of Ministerial Government with a Parliamentary Executive as in Australia, or whether some pattern akin to the American system with a non-Parliamentary Executive should be established?</p>

<p>(6)</p>

<p>In the event of the people attaining self-government what would be Australia’s constitutional and economic relationship at this stage? In short, on what conditions would Australia grant self-government?</p>

<p>In particular:—</p>

<p>(a) Would Australia be prepared to continue to provide major financial assistance to the Territory after self-government and under what conditions?</p>

<p>(b) What would be the nature of the links between Australia and the Territory at Government level?</p>

<p>It is the desire of the Committee to assure the Commonwealth Government that the people of Papua and New Guinea will accept the principles of the Rule of Law and embody those principles in any constitutional changes which may be made.</p>
