                          <p>Port Moresby, 13 June 1967</p>

<p>214.</p>

<p>Following is text of press statement on the nomination of a new political party.</p>

<p>The thirteen men, known as the home rule group,<a href="#f1">1</a> together with some nine elected members of the House of Assembly have joined to form a new political party called the Pangu Pati. (Pangu stands for Papua New Guinea Union). Behind the original group now stand many supporters from every corner of the country and representing all races. These supporters, with those living in Moresby, will form the nucleus of membership of the new party.</p>

<p>As well as individual supporters there are groups of like minded people in other main centres who have expressed their desire to join.</p>

<p>The inaugural group of founding members have formed a parliamentary wing and an interim central executive.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>The parliamentary wing comprises the following Members of the House of Assembly:</p>

<p><em>[matter omitted]<a href="#f3">3</a></em></p>

<p>There are other members who have indicated their desire to join the parliamentary wing and their names will be announced from time to time. The parliamentary wing will soon elect a parliamentary leader. Also the names of Pangu Pati candidates standing under the Pangu Pati banner at the next elections will be announced.</p>

<p>The interim central executive of the Pangu Pati is as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Bung (rotating chairman)</th>
      <th>Mr J.K. Nombri</th>
    </tr>

      <td> </td>
      <td>Mr Oala Oala Rarua</td>

      <td>Mr Mike Somare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Mr Albert Maori Kiki</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Members</td>
      <td>Mr Epel Tito</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Mr Thomas Tobaining<a href="#f4">4</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The central executive has nearly completed a draft constitution.</p>

<p>The founding members have drawn up a draft statement of the Pangu Pati’s policies, aims and objectives. These are outlined under fourteen main heads and a number of subheadings. This platform will be enlarged on and spelt out in greater detail from time to time. The main points are:</p>

<p>1. <em>Home rule leading to ultimate independence</em></p>

<p>(a) That means we aim for independence in the future but we must have time to learn and our leaders must begin to train for this through taking part in executive government.</p>

<p>(b) We know there is widespread demand throughout the country for some measure of full ministerial responsibility and executive government.</p>

<p>(c) The Pangu Pati represents this demand and will go to the country on this issue at the next elections.</p>

<p>2. <em>Unification of Papua New Guinea</em><br />
Pangu stands for one name—one country—one people regardless of race or language.</p>

<p>(a) We will work for changes to be made in the Papua New Guinea Act in order to bring about the political and constitutional unity of the two territories.</p>

<p>(b) To this end we will make every effort to break down barriers-and encourage unity and confidence.</p>

<p>3. <em>Pidgin to be the common language of communication</em><br />
While seeing this as inevitable Pangu stresses that English must be the official language of administration and commerce.</p>

<p>4. <em>Localisation of the public service</em><br />
Pangu believes that localisation of the public service must become a fact and not just a policy on paper. In order to speed this up—</p>

<p>(a) Greater importance must be given to the training of local officers on the job and in all training institutions.</p>

<p>(b) Full support must be given to the scale of salaries for local officers as put forward by the Public Service Association.</p>

<p>(c) A public service board must take the place of the Public Service Commissioner.</p>

<p>(d) At the same time we must attract and hold the services of overseas officers whose expert and professional help and advice we will need for many years to come.</p>

<p>5. <em>Economic development</em></p>

<p>(a) Pangu will work for and encourage increased and diversified primary production and more secondary industries to replace goods at present imported.</p>

<p>(b) We must aim to be self-supporting in commodities that we can produce in this country such as meat, fish, rice, sugar, tea etc.</p>

<p>6. <em>Overseas investment</em><br />
Pangu stands for the encouragement of overseas capital investment in Papua New Guinea. To do this—</p>

<p>(a) <a href="#f5">5</a> The security of overseas investment must be guaranteed and, at the same time, adequate provision must be made to safeguard national interests as well as the people’s interests.</p>

<p>7. <em>Increase the national income</em><br />
Pangu aims high. To double the real national income within ten years.</p>

<p>8. <em>Cooperatives</em><br />
Pangu will offer full support for the cooperative movement in the following ways:</p>

<p>(a) Present investment in cooperatives must be safeguarded and adequately supervised by increased staff.</p>

<p>(b) There must be greater emphasis on the development and supervision of producer cooperatives—both primary and secondary.</p>

<p>9. <em>Land reform</em></p>

<p>(a) The time is overdue for a complete review of the land tenure system. Land is the only wealth a great many people possess. At the same time, land is a national asset and must be used and developed and not left idle.</p>

<p>(10) <em>Local government—new department</em><br />
Pangu will press for the setting up of a new Department of Local Government that will be independent of the Department of District Administration and will have its own minister.</p>

<p>11. <em>Education</em><br />
Far greater assistance must be given to missions in the running of primary and secondary schools. The Administration alone cannot do this job.<br />
Pangu’s policy on education covers increased educational subsidies to missions, one syllabus for all schools, [and a] national adult literary<a href="#f6">6</a> program.</p>

<p>12. <em>Rural and technical education-school drop-outs</em></p>

<p>(a) Pangu will work for the stressing of rural or farm and technical education to be included in primary and secondary schools.</p>

<p>(b) The number of boys and girls obliged to leave school in the lower grades is increasing. A national sett<a href="#f7">7</a> is becoming calamity. Yet nothing is being done for them. We regard this problem as one of urgent priority.</p>

<p>13. <em>Housing</em><br />
Pangu will make the provision of adequate housing one of its main objectives.<a href="#f8">8</a> Advocate the setting up of a national housing authority to meet the critical housing shortage.</p>

<p>14. <em>Better communications</em><br />
Communication facilities in a developing country are a prime necessity—not a luxury. National unity, economic progress and administrative efficiency all depend on adequate communication. To this end—</p>

<p>(a) Pangu will work for an imaginative program, both short term and long term to cover roads and coastal shipping.</p>

<p>(b) Transport by road and ship and air must ensure the dignity, comfort and safety of passengers.</p>

<p>(c) Join Papua and New Guinea by road.</p>

<p>(d) We must have telegraphic communications (and telephones) that keep ahead of economic progress and contribute to it, not lag behind.</p>

<p>(e) The internal link with the Seacom cable must be given priority.</p>

<p>15. <em>Better conditions for rural urban workers</em></p>

<p>2 On 14 June, Somers cabled Swift asking for advice as to the legality in the Commonwealth of public servants having membership of a party or holding office within it. ‘As we see it’, he noted, ‘there is nothing in the Territory Public Service Ordinance and regulations to prohibit either membership or acceptance of office’ (telex 1315, NAA: A452, 1967/4039). Territories replied that there were ‘no legal or other restrictions’ on such activities in the Commonwealth public service, adding that ‘Existing public service legislation is effective in handling an officer whose activities get out of hand’ (telex 35811102, 19 June 1967, ibid.).</p>

<p>3 Matter omitted includes MHA’s Paul Lapun, Pita Lus (Dreikikir open electorate), Barry Holloway, Nicholas Brokam, James Meanggarum (Ramu open), Anthony Voutas (Kaindi open electorate), Paliau Maloat (Manus open), Wegra Kenu and Siwi Kurondo.</p>

<p>4 This should probably read ‘Thomas Tobunbun’ followed by ‘Yin Tobaining’.</p>

<p>5 No ‘(b)’ sub-paragraph exists in the original.</p>

<p>6 This should perhaps read ‘literacy’.</p>

<p>7 The telex appears to have been corrupted at this point.</p>

<p>8 The word ‘We’ or similar appears to be missing here.</p>
