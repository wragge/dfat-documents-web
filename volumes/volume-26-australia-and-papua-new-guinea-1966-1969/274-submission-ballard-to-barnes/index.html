                          <p>Canberra, 23 May 1969</p>

<p><strong>Papua and New Guinea: Gazelle Peninsula—protest march</strong></p>

<p>Following a march through Rabaul of between 5,000 and 10,000 persons on Friday 16th May<a href="#f1">1</a> a number of resolutions referring to the establishment of the Gazelle Local Government Council as multi-racial and signed by Mr. Melchior Tomot as Secretary to the meeting held before the march were presented by Mr. O. Tammur to the District Commissioner. In summary these resolutions which have been numbered a–h stated:</p>

<p>2. (a) No committee was set up to explain the implications of a multi-racial council, the Tolais were not consulted, the people were surprised to hear their council has been undemocratically proclaimed multi-racial.</p>

<p>(b) This group (of 10,000) believes it is right in opposing:</p>

<p>• a multi-racial council—is a step towards self government which should be manned by entirely indigenous staff;</p>

<p>• the proclamation made by a minority of officials;</p>

<p>• the proclamation transgresses the <em>UNO. charter</em> ;</p>

<p>• the Administration should not quote <em>the U.N. charter</em> because House of Assembly has disapproved of U.N.’s excessive vigilance over the Territory’s affairs.</p>

<p>(c) Group concerned that proclamation is to be followed by land legislation at next House sittings. Fears expressed that land rights might be lost.</p>

<p>(d) Group realises need to retain expatriates but people should be trained to govern in own way, not expatriates’ way.</p>

<p>• Group demands immediate hearing of outstanding land cases;</p>

<p>• Group demands immediate compensation payments for alienated land but would prefer return of lands and rights rather than money;</p>

<p>(e) Members of group representing 70 villages believe Administration is ruling Council—villagers no longer have a say.</p>

<p>(f) Group no longer has confidence in Administration at Rabaul.</p>

<p>(g) Group concerned that Administration has bought up all arable land in New Britain and is permitting private companies to exploit all economic resources. At independence there will be no resources left with which to finance government.</p>

<p>• do not want multi-racial unity before self government—it is wrong to grant real power to present local government councils.</p>

<p>• it is wrong for Administration to bind people together by multi-racial councils before giving councils real power—this is an injustice.</p>

<p>• we believe Mr. Barnes does not want us to prepare ourselves to govern by stopping any significant developments for 7 years.</p>

<p>• natives do not benefit from 5 year plan—only expatriates.</p>

<p>• Group fears rule by white planters—offer of $60,000 shows corruption is possible.<a href="#f2">2</a></p>

<p>• native ex-servicemen are not receiving same benefits as Australian exservicemen.</p>

<p>• Group rejects the multi-racial council.</p>

<p>• Government policies show Australia wants to deprive us of right of governing ourselves.</p>

<p>• What benefits will natives receive from multi-racial council? Group believes—</p>

<p>• multi-racial council a neutralizer to weaken unity of Tolai people.</p>

<p>• proclamation should be revoked.</p>

<p>• Members of Group wonder who were originators of multi-racial council. Some councillors claim<a href="#f3">3</a> did not know implications—where are we going?</p>

<p>•Group confidently affirm 90% of mixed races do not like multi-racial councils.</p>

<p>(h) Group resolves not to vote in elections but will pay tax to old council.</p>

<p>• believes expatriates on council will dominate council.</p>

<p>• why was Tolai council proclaimed after mainland councils?</p>

<p>• Tolai council was first ever proclaimed—Tolai people should have had precedence in establishing a multi-racial council.</p>

<p>• Government proclaimed other councils first<a href="#f4">4</a> people less sophisticated than Tolais—could not see disadvantages of multi-racial councils.</p>

<p>• wrong to force Tolais with no experience of government into multi-racial council.</p>

<p>• Group desires that natives not expatriates should run country.</p>

<p>• Proclamation should be revoked—old council should be restored.</p>

<p>3. The Department has sought an assessment of the result of the elections. It has also asked for the Administration’s reaction to a proposal to re-introduce legislation making possible the acquisition of unused freehold land. It also proposes to ask the Administration’s reaction to the press suggestion that the agitation relates more to Oscar Tammur’s political activities than to any real sense of grievance.<a href="#f5">5</a></p>

<p>4. The Administration has now advised—</p>

<p>• Council elections will take up to two weeks to complete.</p>

<p>• On first day there was evidence of organised absenteeism in some polling places but reasonable voter roll up in others.</p>

<p>• Everything orderly.</p>

<p>• Department will be kept informed of developments as they arise.</p>

<p>• I will keep you informed.</p>

<p>2  See footnote 5, Document 321.</p>

<p>3  The word ‘they’ seems to be missing here.</p>

<p>4  This should probably read ‘for’.</p>

<p>5  In marginalia of 23 May, Warwick Smith wrote to Barnes: ‘The press suggestion was that Oscar was a “rabble-rouser”—basing his political appeal on such activities’.</p>
