<p>8270/4605. Unclassified Priority</p>

<p>Following is text of message referred to in Secretary’s personal message to Mr Hay 4600 of 31st May.<a href="#f1">1</a></p>

<p><strong>‘Papua and New Guinea Act 1949–1968 —Arrangements approved by the Minister of State for External Territories pursuant to section 25 of the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949–1968</strong></p>

<p><em>Ministerial Member</em></p>

<p>1. In the House of Assembly the Ministerial Member will represent his department and answer questions. He will give the Administration view on resolutions and motions affecting his department and generally support the policies and actions of the Administration. The Ministerial Member will introduce legislation concerning his department’s functions and take the responsibility for guiding the legislation through all proceedings in the House.</p>

<p>2. The Ministerial Member may, with the agreement of the Administrator, initiate legislatory proposals for submission to the Administrator’s Executive Council concerning his function and introduce matters for discussion in the Council. He may also take part in the discussion of policy questions on which the Council is consulted by the Administrator, and will represent the interests of his department in discussions on the draft estimates in the Council.</p>

<p>3. In the matter of departmental functions and operations the Ministerial Member will assume responsibility with the departmental head for matters to which<a href="#f2">2</a> the functions relating to a specified department of the public service relate and including the exercise of major financial delegations. The Ministerial Member will take part in the formulation of policies, plans and proposals for expenditure in his department (including the preparation of departmental estimates) and will exercise such delegations as may be authorised by the Administrator. He will make policy and administrative decisions together with the departmental head after considering papers and recommendations submitted to him by his department and record such decisions in writing on the papers. As the Ministerial Member will be generally assisting in the administration of the Territory it will be necessary for him to co-operate with and seek the advice of the departmental head on matters related to the exercise of his functions. In accordance with generally accepted practice members of the Council should not publicly oppose decisions that are in accordance with the advice of the Council.</p>

<p><em>Relationship of Ministerial Member and departmental head</em></p>

<p>4. The effective working of the system will require close co-operation between the departmental head and the Ministerial Member. Generally the departmental head will co-operate with and tender advice to the Ministerial Member on matters within the Ministerial Member’s competence. The management and public service aspects of the conduct of departments will remain the responsibility of departmental heads.</p>

<p>5. In relation to both the House of Assembly and the Administrator’s Executive Council, the departmental head will advise the Ministerial Member on matters within the competence of his department. He will attend meetings of the Council at the request of the Administrator or the Ministerial Member.</p>

<p>6. On other matters not involving the origination of new policy proposals the Ministerial Member and the departmental head will make their decisions jointly.</p>

<p>7. Where a new policy proposal is to be originated it may emanate from either the departmental head or the Ministerial Member. A departmental head desiring to originate a policy proposal will place a written recommendation supported by reasons before the Ministerial Member. If the Ministerial Member does not agree with the proposal the departmental head could refer it to the Administrator if he wished to take it further. If a Ministerial Member desires to initiate a policy proposal he will request the department to prepare the proposal in writing after considering all relevant aspects including any comments from other departments affected. If the departmental head does not agree that the proposal should be put forward he will refer it to the Administrator if the Ministerial Member desired this course.</p>

<p><em>Assistant Ministerial Member</em></p>

<p>8. The Assistant Ministerial Member will be consulted by the departmental head and senior officers in major matters affecting his functions but decisions will be made by the departmental head. He will also perform all or some of the following activities as and when required:—</p>

<p>- assist during preparation of bills within department</p>

<p>- represent the department at official functions</p>

<p>- answer questions in the House</p>

<p>- meet official visitors</p>

<p>- participate in departmental conferences</p>

<p>- participate in preparing budget estimates</p>

<p>- participate in departmental policy formation</p>

<p>- undertake liaison with representative public bodies</p>

<p>9. Assistant Ministerial Members will meet jointly from time to time with the Administrator, Ministerial Members (as appropriate) and/or senior officers to discuss and study proposed legislation and other matters of Territory interest.’</p>
