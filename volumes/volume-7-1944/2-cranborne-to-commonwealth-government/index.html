                          <p>Cablegram D1 LONDON, 2 January 1944, 3.55 p.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>My telegram of 31st December, D.1214. [1]</p>

<p>Following estimation as at end of November has been received from</p>

<p>His Majesty’s United Kingdom Ambassador, Washington of the</p>

<p>official United States attitude towards post-war civil air</p>

<p>transport. Begins:-</p>

<p>1. The following estimation of the official American attitude to</p>

<p>wards post-war civil air transport is necessarily a statement of</p>

<p>opinion. It represents the position as we see it at the moment but</p>

<p>American views are still fluid.</p>

<p>2. It would seem that American aims in the field of post-war civil</p>

<p>air transport may be:</p>

<p>(a) The establishment of at least one American round the world air</p>

<p>service plus commercial air entry into all major nations. A route</p>

<p>across Russia might perhaps be regarded as a better proposition</p>

<p>than one alongside a British route via India.</p>

<p>(b) The right to operate air services in the Middle East and</p>

<p>Africa with at least partial cabotage.</p>

<p>(c) Unrestricted civil air transit rights (implying rights of</p>

<p>innocent passage and of landing for non-traffic purposes) with</p>

<p>some additional rights in Canada (to Alaska), Newfoundland,</p>

<p>Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, Bermuda, West Indies, Guiana and the</p>

<p>Irish Free State to be obtained in exchange for transit rights in</p>

<p>America, the Pacific Islands and Alaska while keeping South</p>

<p>America and the Pacific as much as possible for the Americans.</p>

<p>(d) A permanent agreement embodying the above rights.</p>

<p>3. It is probable that Americans would dislike agreements between</p>

<p>any two or more countries which discriminate against third parties</p>

<p>except perhaps present enemies. They fear that in the absence of</p>

<p>international agreement the United Kingdom and the dominions may</p>

<p>be driven back on to an ‘all red’ policy which would hamper</p>

<p>American air line development abroad.</p>

<p>4. Internal political considerations are likely to make it</p>

<p>essential for the Americans to obtain a form of agreement which</p>

<p>will satisfy public opinion that reasonable use of airfields</p>

<p>constructed by them overseas has been secured. Some sort of</p>

<p>international control might be regarded as a satisfactory</p>

<p>solution.</p>

<p>5. Although at first sight these aims may appear formidable the</p>

<p>Americans recognise that there are also legitimate British aims</p>

<p>which must be met, for example transit rights across America, the</p>

<p>Pacific Islands and Alaska.</p>

<p>6. There seems no reason to suppose that the Americans would</p>

<p>reject the first two of the ‘Four Freedoms’ adopted by the</p>

<p>Commonwealth Conference in London [2], viz. the right of innocent</p>

<p>passage and the right to land for non-traffic purposes, since</p>

<p>these are essential to accomplish American aims. It is thought</p>

<p>that the last two, viz. the right to land passengers from the</p>

<p>country of origin and the right to pick up passengers for the</p>

<p>country of origin, might be acceptable subject to agreement on</p>

<p>regulation and provisions for special variations or arrangements</p>

<p>affecting contiguous countries, for example Canada and America. It</p>

<p>is observed that freight and mails are not specifically referred</p>

<p>to in the last two freedoms but the Americans would probably</p>

<p>consider that they would have to be included in the scope of any</p>

<p>satisfactory international agreement.</p>

<p>7. The Americans might agree that carriage of passengers by</p>

<p>country A between countries B and C should be subject to</p>

<p>negotiations between countries concerned.</p>

<p>8. As regards the right to carry between two points in one</p>

<p>country, not the country of origin, the Americans would be</p>

<p>unwilling to concede cabotage within United States and are</p>

<p>unlikely to grant it between United States territories. On the</p>

<p>other hand, despite what Mr. Berle has said, they might try to</p>

<p>obtain it for themselves elsewhere; for example within and between</p>

<p>British territories in Africa. They will be reluctant to recognise</p>

<p>the British Commonwealth as a unit for this purpose because they</p>

<p>realize their lack of bargaining powers in the cabotage field.</p>

<p>They may therefore try to avoid discussing it until other</p>

<p>controversial points have been settled.</p>

<p>9. The Americans recognise the need for an international technical</p>

<p>authority to replace the International Commission on air</p>

<p>navigation. They might also suggest placing finance and operation</p>

<p>of airfields in hazardous or undeveloped territories such as</p>

<p>Greenland, Iceland and Liberia on an international basis.</p>

<p>10. As regards an operating executive the Americans would probably</p>

<p>agree but it is probable that the State Department and Civil</p>

<p>Aeronautics Department would want to exercise close control of</p>

<p>American representatives. It is not possible to say what form of</p>

<p>executive they would favour pending clarification of their own</p>

<p>policy as regards a ‘chosen instrument’ although it seems likely</p>

<p>they will retain a free commercial basis. On the relationship of</p>

<p>this international authority to any United Nations security</p>

<p>organization which may be established no opinion can be given.</p>

<p>11. The proposal for international zones of operation is unlikely</p>

<p>to appeal to the Americans. They might agree as regards Europe but</p>

<p>the problem of international operation in the Middle and Far East</p>

<p>seems likely to raise difficult issues. American views on this can</p>

<p>only be elicited by direct discussion. Counter proposals to make</p>

<p>Latin America exclusively [an] [3] American field might be put</p>

<p>forward.</p>

<p>12. The above seems to show that the argument will be tough but</p>

<p>that in spite of divergencies a basis for agreement upon</p>

<p>principles might be found.</p>

<p>1 On file AA:A989, 43/735/833/1. It outlined U.S. aviation</p>

<p>interests in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and stressed</p>

<p>U.K. wishes for informal discussion on civil aviation issues with</p>

<p>the State Department.</p>

<p>2 Informal talks on civil aviation held in October 1943 (see</p>

<p>Documents on Australian Foreign Policy 1937-49, vol. VI, Documents</p>

<p>299-300 and 316).</p>
