                          <p>Dispatch 44/1/1 (extracts) WELLINGTON, 5 January 1944</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>1. Since my arrival in Wellington [1] I have endeavoured to gain</p>

<p>some idea of the lines on which New Zealand Ministers and</p>

<p>officials were thinking with regard to the problems which are due</p>

<p>to come up for discussion between Australia and New Zealand this</p>

<p>month. I have had lengthy and friendly discussions with most</p>

<p>members of the Government and heads of departments and I have</p>

<p>touched on as many as possible of the subjects listed on the draft</p>

<p>agenda. [2]</p>

<p>2. From these preliminary discussions, what has impressed me</p>

<p>generally has been the scarcity of thought which has as yet been</p>

<p>given here to many of the major topics on which it is hoped to</p>

<p>reach agreement. I have consequently emphasised that the</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government is preparing carefully for the conference</p>

<p>and that the New Zealand delegation should be in a position to</p>

<p>express their views fully on all questions likely to be raised.</p>

<p>3. For example, international civil aviation is a subject which</p>

<p>has apparently not been deeply thought out here. The Minister of</p>

<p>Defence, Mr. Jones, is also Minister of Air, but he does not</p>

<p>regard post-war civil aviation as coming within his sphere. The</p>

<p>Director General of Civil Aviation [3] is at present stationed in</p>

<p>Melbourne as a liaison officer and it is doubtful whether the</p>

<p>Secretary, Department of Air [4], whose views I reported in my</p>

<p>despatch No. 5 of 23rd December, 1943 [5], may be regarded as</p>

<p>fully reflecting the ideas of the Government. Previous decisions</p>

<p>regarding Pacific air routes and landing rights were handled</p>

<p>personally by Mr. Nash, and in his absence the whole subject is</p>

<p>held to be a question of policy devolving on the Prime Minister</p>

<p>alone. How far the views attributed to Mr. Nash in Australia</p>

<p>regarding the establishment of an international aviation concern</p>

<p>in the Pacific are shared by Mr. Fraser I cannot say, but I should</p>

<p>judge that the whole problem has not yet received very full</p>

<p>consideration here.</p>

<p>4. There is no New Zealand Minister responsible for post-war</p>

<p>reconstruction in the sense in which the term is used in</p>

<p>Australia. Major Skinner is Minister of Rehabilitation but his</p>

<p>duties extend only to the repatriation of returned soldiers and</p>

<p>the scope of duties of the newly appointed Director of</p>

<p>Rehabilitation, Colonel Baker, does not compare with that of the</p>

<p>Australian Department of Post-War Reconstruction. A number of</p>

<p>‘Local Rehabilitation Committees’ have been established in towns</p>

<p>and cities throughout New Zealand and there are some inter-</p>

<p>Ministerial committees on various aspects of reconstruction, but</p>

<p>from what I have gathered their work has not reached the standard</p>

<p>of that done by our Australian committees. As emerged from a</p>

<p>conversation with Mr. Skinner, it appears that where there is a</p>

<p>divergence of opinion between different Ministers, the Prime</p>

<p>Minister is expected to intervene and define the Government’s</p>

<p>policy.</p>

<p>5. Migration is a topic to which very little thought has been</p>

<p>given by the New Zealand Government. Although there is a Minister</p>

<p>of Migration, there is no Department, committee or official whose</p>

<p>task it has been to advise on migration policy although I assume</p>

<p>that this question has been raised by the United Kingdom</p>

<p>Government with New Zealand as with Australia. The only opinions</p>

<p>which I have heard expressed here are firstly, that New Zealand,</p>

<p>until there are houses enough for the present population, cannot</p>

<p>receive further inhabitants and secondly, that New Zealand, being</p>

<p>essentially an agricultural community, will never have a large</p>

<p>population. There seems to be little recognition of the</p>

<p>possibility that the pressure of a world opinion upon countries</p>

<p>which may be regarded as under-populated may force migration to be</p>

<p>considered at the forthcoming peace settlements. The only</p>

<p>documentation on this topic likely to be presented at the</p>

<p>conference will probably be prepared in the Department of External</p>

<p>Affairs, and policy is likely to be decided by the Prime Minister</p>

<p>when the question arises.</p>

<p>6. On the question of the future organisation of the Pacific it is</p>

<p>difficult to give a very clear indication of New Zealand’s views.</p>

<p>Mr. Nash has already spoken on this matter in Australia, when he</p>

<p>amplified the remarks which, as reported in despatch No. 1 of 13th</p>

<p>December, 1943 [6], he made to me on the day of my arrival in</p>

<p>Wellington. As you have probably seen from press reports, Mr.</p>

<p>Fraser immediately issued a statement making it clear that Mr.</p>

<p>Nash’s views were expressed person ally and had not been approved</p>

<p>by the New Zealand Government. From the full copy of Mr. Fraser’s</p>

<p>statement, which I attach, you will note the Prime Minister’s</p>

<p>opinion that ‘federation in the sense of union or transfer of</p>

<p>sovereignty on the part of the Pacific Powers was not in the mind</p>

<p>of the New Zealand Government’. Mr. Fraser endorsed however the</p>

<p>principle of trusteeship which he said had formed the basis of New</p>

<p>Zealand’s policy in relation to the Pacific peoples under their</p>

<p>control for many years.</p>

<p>7. On broad questions of policy such as international security,</p>

<p>regional advisory commissions for certain areas, disarmament and</p>

<p>the establishment of world order, I should judge from contacts</p>

<p>with officials that the New Zealand Government may be expected to</p>

<p>continue to hold views very similar to those expressed at the</p>

<p>League of Nations in 1936 and after when the New Zealand</p>

<p>representative was an advocate of collective security, and the</p>

<p>strengthening of the League structure. Mr. Fraser has expressed to</p>

<p>me his concurrence with the views contained in Mr. Curtin’s recent</p>

<p>address to the Triennial Conference of the Australian Labor Party.</p>

<p>[7]</p>

<p>8. Should economic questions be discussed such as the application</p>

<p>of Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, it must be remembered</p>

<p>that the major factor in New Zealand’s policy is the dependence of</p>

<p>this country’s economy on the British market for dairy products,</p>

<p>meat and wool. This is a theme to which New Zealanders tend to</p>

<p>revert whether in speaking of the possible expansion of industry</p>

<p>in New Zealand, the growth of trade with Australia, post-war</p>

<p>reconstruction or international commercial policy generally. They</p>

<p>regard Australia’s economy as being more varied and resilient and</p>

<p>are, I feel, inclined to underestimate the degree of dependence of</p>

<p>Australia also on markets for a few primary products. Although</p>

<p>commercial policy is not listed on the draft agenda for the</p>

<p>conference, I think that Mr. Fraser would be willing to discuss it</p>

<p>and, as I have said before, it is a topic which in the minds of</p>

<p>New Zealanders, is fundamentally important to their future</p>

<p>development.</p>

<p>9. It is possible that the question of supply and especially of</p>

<p>food production will be discussed and I think it desirable that it</p>

<p>should. Since my arrival here I have spoken continually of the</p>

<p>efforts Australia has made in this field, of our vastly increased</p>

<p>production, of our strict rationing, and of the goods which are</p>

<p>not rationed but which are unobtainable in our country. Privately</p>

<p>I have drawn the contrast with New Zealand which is still a land</p>

<p>of plenty and where, to the civilian, the war is a long way away</p>

<p>and tending to recede further daily. Even the official attitude</p>

<p>here is somewhat complacent and, whereas in Australia every effort</p>

<p>is made to shoulder extra commitments, here the marketing</p>

<p>authorities tend to adopt the attitude that plans which have been</p>

<p>made for a year ahead cannot be altered.</p>

<p>10. From what I can gather it is to be assumed that no general</p>

<p>increase in food production is expected this season. The season</p>

<p>has not been good and the farmers have faced similar difficulties</p>

<p>to Australia in obtaining fertilisers and machinery. On the other</p>

<p>hand there is a fairly widespread feeling that in the spheres both</p>

<p>of tighter rationing and increased production New Zealand could do</p>

<p>more, as the attached press cuttings show. What is needed is a</p>

<p>strong lead, and I believe that if the Government gave it the</p>

<p>people would respond as they have done in Australia. Every effort</p>

<p>should be made to bring home to the New Zealand delegation the</p>

<p>extent of Australia’s contribution to the Allied food requirements</p>

<p>and every encouragement given them to take firmer steps here to</p>

<p>increase the amount available from this country. The complacency</p>

<p>of New Zealanders in this field, due as it is to their isolation,</p>

<p>could be shaken by bringing forcibly to their notice the efforts</p>

<p>of their sister Dominion.</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>14. In the discussions, the predominant position of the New</p>

<p>Zealand Prime Minister should be kept in mind. Mr. Fraser and Mr.</p>

<p>Nash are the outstanding leaders of the New Zealand Government,</p>

<p>but while Mr. Nash is more productive of ideas, Mr. Fraser is the</p>

<p>man to make decisions. For that reason I think that although as</p>

<p>mentioned earlier in this despatch, the New Zealand delegation may</p>

<p>come to the talks with no very detailed statements of policy,</p>

<p>concrete results may be expected.</p>

<p>Of all major questions of policy in New Zealand today Mr. Fraser</p>

<p>appears to be the main arbiter. The two Ministers [8] accompanying</p>

<p>him to the talks may be expected to play parts of very minor</p>

<p>importance.</p>

<p>The decisions will be made by Mr. Fraser, and once made he will be</p>

<p>in a strong position to gain their acceptance by his Government</p>

<p>and party.</p>
