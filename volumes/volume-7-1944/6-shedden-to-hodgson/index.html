<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>FUTURE OF SOUTHWEST PACIFIC REGION-CONFERENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN</p>

<p>AND NEW ZEALAND MINISTERS, JANUARY 1944</p>

<p>With further reference to my letter of 20th December [1] I am</p>

<p>forwarding herewith a copy of a report by the Defence Committee on</p>

<p>the subjects on which information has been sought by you.</p>

<p>2. In view of the urgency with which this information is required</p>

<p>and owing to the absence of the Minister for Defence in Western</p>

<p>Australia, it has not been possible to submit the report to him.</p>

<p>As I have already discussed the subjects with the Minister I am</p>

<p>aware that the report meets with his general approval, subject to</p>

<p>the following special observations on certain passages:-</p>

<p>Fundamental Assumptions</p>

<p>Paragraph 5(a). In regard to the assumption in paragraph 5(a) of</p>

<p>the Defence Committee’s report that total reliance should not be</p>

<p>placed on any system of collective security, it is observed that</p>

<p>the establishment of an effective regional collective system in</p>

<p>the Pacific is considered by the Minister to be of vital</p>

<p>importance to Australia. He made this clear in his speech of 14th</p>

<p>December, 1943. [2]</p>

<p>As stated in paragraph 6 of the Defence Committee’s report, it is</p>

<p>impracticable for Australia and New Zealand to defend the</p>

<p>Southwest Pacific Area unaided and this has been the experience of</p>

<p>the present war. Australia is in a sphere of American strategic</p>

<p>responsibility and its security has been largely dependent on</p>

<p>American seapower and assistance from United States Land and Air</p>

<p>Forces and supplies which could not have reached this theatre but</p>

<p>for the exercise of such command of the sea.</p>

<p>Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be</p>

<p>controlled by a friendly Power</p>

<p>Paragraph 21. The Minister considers that the establishment of a</p>

<p>base in the Solomon Islands - New Hebrides Area as a joint United</p>

<p>Kingdom - Australian - New Zealand commitment is a matter for</p>

<p>later consideration in the light of subsequent discussions with</p>

<p>the New Zealand and United Kingdom Governments. This principle</p>

<p>also has a bearing on the reciprocal aspect of Australian</p>

<p>participation in the garrisoning of bases such as Singapore which</p>

<p>might later be raised by the United Kingdom Government.</p>

<p>The extent to which Australia will be able to maintain or to</p>

<p>contribute to the maintenance of the base in the Solomon Islands</p>

<p>New Hebrides Area depends upon the future strength of the</p>

<p>Australian Forces. This is related to the effectiveness of the</p>

<p>collective system that may be established and a review of the</p>

<p>principles of Defence which emerge as the result of the experience</p>

<p>of this war. The former cannot yet be determined and the Defence</p>

<p>Committee has an instruction to report upon the latter as soon as</p>

<p>it feels that it is in a position to do so.</p>

<p>Also related to the question of garrisoning bases outside</p>

<p>Australian territory in the post-war period are the limitations</p>

<p>imposed by the Defence Act.</p>

<p>There is also the definitive extent of the responsibility of the</p>

<p>Commonwealth Government for the Local Defence of Australia. In the</p>

<p>light of the experience of this war and the views outlined by the</p>

<p>Defence Committee, the security of Australia can most effectively</p>

<p>be ensured by a defence system founded on an outer screen of bases</p>

<p>in the adjacent islands. The question of the scope of Australian</p>

<p>Local Defence is also linked with the further development of co-</p>

<p>operation in Empire Defence.</p>

<p>3. In connection with your further letter of 31st December [3],</p>

<p>the aspects relating to defence policy are covered by the report</p>

<p>of the Defence Committee. It is added that the Defence Committee</p>

<p>considers that the subject matter of its report should not be</p>

<p>included in the confidential Handbook.</p>

<p>4. Enquiries have been made of this Department by Service</p>

<p>Departments as to the scope of the advice which your Department</p>

<p>desires from them in pursuance of a similar request made to them.</p>

<p>As the Minister for Defence is responsible for Defence Policy and</p>

<p>as matters relating to the activities of the Services included in</p>

<p>the draft agenda may have implications from the aspect of Defence</p>

<p>Policy, it has been arranged that Service Departments will</p>

<p>transmit any information that they may wish to furnish through</p>

<p>this Department. The attendance of any representative of a Service</p>

<p>Department will be at the discretion of the Service Minister</p>

<p>concerned for advice to him on Service aspects not involving</p>

<p>questions of Defence Policy.</p>

<p>F. G. SHEDDEN</p>

<p>Enclosure</p>

<p>FUTURE OF SOUTHWEST PACIFIC REGION-CONFERENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN</p>

<p>AND NEW ZEALAND MINISTERS, JANUARY 1944 [4]</p>

<p>TERMS OF REFERENCE</p>

<p>The Defence Committee noted the wish of the Minister for De fence</p>

<p>that the Defence Committee should consider what could be done</p>

<p>towards meeting the request of the Department of External Affairs</p>

<p>for information on the following subjects for use in connexion</p>

<p>with the forthcoming conference between Australian and New Zealand</p>

<p>Ministers on the future of the Southwest Pacific Area:-</p>

<p>(1) Bases in the Southwest Pacific Area which must be controlled</p>

<p>by Australia;</p>

<p>(2) Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be</p>

<p>controlled by a friendly power;</p>

<p>(3) Extent to which Australia could maintain bases mentioned under</p>

<p>(1), including consideration of cost, manpower, industrial</p>

<p>potential, etc.;</p>

<p>(4) Mutual defence problems and interests of Australia and New</p>

<p>Zealand;</p>

<p>(5) Desirable forms of mutual assistance as contribution by</p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand towards maintenance of peace and</p>

<p>security (e.g. munitions, aircraft, staff co-operation, supply);</p>

<p>(6) Defence problems connected with civil air transport in South</p>

<p>west and South Pacific Areas;</p>

<p>(7) General view of a desirable international security system in</p>

<p>the Western Pacific.</p>

<p>2. The Defence Committee was informed that the Department of</p>

<p>External Affairs had on enquiry advised that for the purposes of</p>

<p>the foregoing Terms of Reference it was intended:-</p>

<p>(a) that the phrase ‘friendly power’ in paragraph 2 should be</p>

<p>taken to include the United Kingdom and New Zealand; and</p>

<p>(b) that the phrase ‘Western Pacific’ in paragraph 7 should be</p>

<p>taken to include the Far East.</p>

<p>The Defence Committee also proceeded on the basis that Australia</p>

<p>should be taken to include Australian Territories and the</p>

<p>Australian Mandated Territories.</p>

<p>3. With reference to the use of phrase ‘friendly power’ to cover</p>

<p>the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the Defence Committee re</p>

<p>corded its view that it was inappropriate to refer to other</p>

<p>members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as ‘friendly</p>

<p>powers’ and that such usage would be likely to cause confusion</p>

<p>particularly in connexion with matters of Imperial defence.</p>

<p>4. It was noted that in requesting the Defence Committee to</p>

<p>provide information upon the foregoing matters, the Minister for</p>

<p>De fence has stated that he realized that some of the questions</p>

<p>are dependent upon the effectiveness of any system of collective</p>

<p>security that may be established and on the strength of the forces</p>

<p>to be maintained after the war, and on both of these questions</p>

<p>some guidance from the Government is really necessary in the first</p>

<p>place. The task of preparing this report in connexion with</p>

<p>problems affecting the Pacific Area has demonstrated to the</p>

<p>Defence Committee the force of these observations and it has been</p>

<p>felt that, in the absence of that guidance from the Government and</p>

<p>in the present state of uncertainty, the most that can be done is</p>

<p>to make certain fundamental assumptions and deal with the</p>

<p>questions broadly upon such a basis.</p>

<p>FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS</p>

<p>5. The Defence Committee considered that, for the purposes of this</p>

<p>report, it was reasonable to assume:-</p>

<p>(a) that total reliance should not be placed on any system of</p>

<p>collective security;</p>

<p>(b) that no country should accept the risk of relying primarily</p>

<p>for its defence upon the assistance of a foreign power;</p>

<p>(c) that the attack upon the Southwest Pacific Region against</p>

<p>which precautions should be taken is that of some first-class</p>

<p>Asiatic Power;</p>

<p>(d) that the present Japanese Mandated Territories will, after the</p>

<p>war, be under the control of a friendly power.</p>

<p>6. The Defence Committee also concluded that, because the security</p>

<p>of sea communications is vital to the defence of the Southwest</p>

<p>Pacific Region and this can only be secured by powerful naval and</p>

<p>air forces, it is impracticable for Australia and New Zealand to</p>

<p>defend the Area unaided and the best assurance of its security</p>

<p>would be a scheme of Imperial defence formulated and carried out</p>

<p>by the members of the British Commonwealth in co-operation. This,</p>

<p>however, would not be to the exclusion of a wider system of</p>

<p>collective security.</p>

<p>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>

<p>7. Before considering the particular subjects referred to it, the</p>

<p>Defence Committee have thought it necessary to state what they</p>

<p>consider are Australia’s primary defence requirements, keeping in</p>

<p>mind the fact that the best defence is a strong and continuous</p>

<p>offensive against the enemy’s bases and sea communications. The</p>

<p>selection and position of our bases should, therefore, be such as</p>

<p>to assist offensive action. These primary requirements are:-</p>

<p>(a) Security of sea communications;</p>

<p>(b) Security from invasion; and</p>

<p>(c) Security from long range bombing from adjacent islands and</p>

<p>sporadic raids.</p>

<p>Security of Sea Communications</p>

<p>8. It is obvious that, unless we are able to protect the sea</p>

<p>routes linking Australia with the outside world and so ensure the</p>

<p>arrival of reinforcements and supplies, our local resources would</p>

<p>eventually be exhausted. The operation of our armed forces and</p>

<p>essential industries would be hampered and restricted through lack</p>

<p>of essential requirements such as fuel and we should be in danger</p>

<p>of falling a victim to the enemy.</p>

<p>9. The main ocean supply routes are open to attack by the enemy at</p>

<p>great distances from Australia, e.g. in the middle of the Pacific</p>

<p>or Indian Oceans, or alternatively at focal points near Australia.</p>

<p>Such attacks may be carried out by powerful naval units, raiders,</p>

<p>submarines, and long range bombers, and protection must be</p>

<p>provided against all these dangers. In order to operate the</p>

<p>necessary forces to give this protection, bases are required</p>

<p>strategically placed between the enemy and the shipping routes</p>

<p>where strong naval and air forces can be stationed to give cover</p>

<p>to the lighter forces such as cruisers, aircraft carriers, and</p>

<p>anti-submarine vessels which are required for the protection of</p>

<p>our convoys. Without this cover, our escorts would be driven from</p>

<p>the sea by powerful enemy units and our shipping would be left to</p>

<p>the mercy of the enemy.</p>

<p>10. In this war, the main bases used for this purpose in the</p>

<p>Pacific and Indian Oceans include the following:-</p>

<p>Pacific: Pearl Harbour, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Solomon</p>

<p>Islands.</p>

<p>Indian: Kilindini, Ceylon.</p>

<p>These bases not only provide a cover for our defensive escorts but</p>

<p>also enable striking forces to attack the enemy’s bases and his</p>

<p>lines of communication.</p>

<p>11. The establishment of any operational base would involve the</p>

<p>provision of major defence works, including seaward and fixed</p>

<p>defences, aerodromes, installations for the repair and maintenance</p>

<p>of equipment and reserves of equipment and stores as well as</p>

<p>substantial Navy, Army and Air Forces as a garrison.</p>

<p>Security from Invasion</p>

<p>12. The best means of securing Australia from invasion is by</p>

<p>taking strong offensive action from established and well defended</p>

<p>forward bases. If, however, an enemy were sufficiently powerful to</p>

<p>seize, hold and develop island bases adjacent to Australia from</p>

<p>which an invasion supported by a strong force of land based and</p>

<p>carrier borne aircraft could be launched against the mainland, it</p>

<p>would be beyond our power to prevent a landing in strength at all</p>

<p>points along the 12,000 mile coastline. It would, however, be</p>

<p>possible, by a suitable disposition of our air and land forces and</p>

<p>by well organized air and land transport, to provide a substantial</p>

<p>degree of protection at vital points which would naturally be the</p>

<p>most attractive to the enemy as affording him the opportunity to</p>

<p>gain the quick decision that would be necessary for him before</p>

<p>overseas reinforcements could be brought up. Accordingly, to</p>

<p>provide advanced positions for offensive operations by our naval</p>

<p>and air forces, to prevent the enemy establishing bases in a</p>

<p>suitable position for an invasion force to assemble, and at the</p>

<p>same time to provide our forces with bases to cut across the</p>

<p>enemy’s lines of communication, it is considered advisable that</p>

<p>well defended bases should be available from the north-west to the</p>

<p>north-east of Australia. Further, the possession of such bases,</p>

<p>constituting as they would a threat to the enemy’s lines of</p>

<p>communication in the event of an attempted invasion, would operate</p>

<p>as a real deterrent to his making such an attempt.</p>

<p>Security from Long Range Bombing and Sporadic Raids</p>

<p>13. It is considered necessary to provide protection against long</p>

<p>range bombing from bases within one thousand miles of Australia’s</p>

<p>industrial centres. This can be most effectively done by the</p>

<p>holding of ,strategically placed bases at a considerable distance</p>

<p>from such centres in the neighbourhood of the areas from which</p>

<p>bombing might be possible.</p>

<p>14. Sporadic raids, i.e. bombardment by surface vessels or bombing</p>

<p>by carrier home aircraft and raids of a commando type having as</p>

<p>their main object destruction of installations followed by a quick</p>

<p>withdrawal, could also be countered from such forward bases.</p>

<p>Selection of Bases</p>

<p>15. In the light of these primary defence requirements, it is</p>

<p>considered that it is necessary to choose bases which will, so far</p>

<p>as possible, serve at the one time the several purposes of.-</p>

<p>(a) affording opportunity for offensive action;</p>

<p>(b) facilitating the rapid transfer of the armed forces of the</p>

<p>nations concerned with the defence of the South and Southwest</p>

<p>Pacific regions to permit of concentrations for operational</p>

<p>purposes;</p>

<p>(c) protecting sea communications;</p>

<p>(d) safeguarding against invasion; and</p>

<p>(e) safeguarding against bombing and sporadic raids.</p>

<p>The bases chosen should provide harbour facilities for naval</p>

<p>forces, a large number of air strips for the operation of strong</p>

<p>air forces, and should be so situated and adapted that they lend</p>

<p>themselves to effective land defence.</p>

<p>PARTICULAR SUBJECTS</p>

<p>16. With the foregoing general considerations in mind, and subject</p>

<p>to more detailed examination by the interested powers of the bases</p>

<p>to be selected, the Defence Committee submits the following views</p>

<p>upon the particular subjects upon which information is sought.</p>

<p>Bases in Southwest Pacific Area which must be controlled by</p>

<p>Australia</p>

<p>17. In the north-west, it is considered that although Darwin</p>

<p>should constitute the main base for the defence of Australia and</p>

<p>for offensive operations against enemy bases and lines of</p>

<p>communication, its effectiveness would be greatly enhanced by the</p>

<p>control of an advanced base in an area such as Timor for the</p>

<p>operation of air squadrons in particular. The possession of such a</p>

<p>base would add greatly to the range of offensive naval and air</p>

<p>operations and its denial to the enemy would remove a threat</p>

<p>which, as experience shows, prevents the full use of</p>

<p>Darwin as a naval base and ties down considerable land and air</p>

<p>forces.</p>

<p>18. In the north-east, it is considered that, in addition to other</p>

<p>bases in Australian Mandated Territories, a strong naval and air</p>

<p>base protected by an adequate garrison should be established in an</p>

<p>area such as the Admiralty islands. Such a location would be</p>

<p>preferable to Rabaul for a number of reasons, including the</p>

<p>following-</p>

<p>(a) it is the most northerly situation available and, if bypassed,</p>

<p>would constitute a continuous threat to enemy lines of</p>

<p>communication;</p>

<p>(b) it has a better harbour available;</p>

<p>(c) there would be no danger to installations from volcanic</p>

<p>disturbances;</p>

<p>(d) it is more easily protected in that it could not be approached</p>

<p>by successive steps along the coast but would have to be directly</p>

<p>assaulted from the sea.</p>

<p>19. It is considered necessary that arrangements should be made</p>

<p>for the establishment and maintenance of such bases and that</p>

<p>action should not be deferred until an emergency arises.</p>

<p>Bases in the South and Southwest Pacific Areas which must be</p>

<p>controlled by a friendly power</p>

<p>20. The Defence Committee considers that in view of the geo</p>

<p>graphical position of the Netherlands East Indies, it is necessary</p>

<p>for the safety of Australia that these Islands should be in the</p>

<p>possession of a friendly power and that strong bases (including a</p>

<p>base at Sourabaya) should be established for their protection to</p>

<p>prevent them being used as stepping stones for an attack upon</p>

<p>Australia.</p>

<p>21. A base in the Solomon Islands - New Hebrides Area is</p>

<p>considered important to the security of Australia, but in view of</p>

<p>her limited resources, Australia may not be fully able to maintain</p>

<p>this base, having regard to other essential commitments. It is</p>

<p>considered, however, that Australia should contribute to the</p>

<p>maintenance of the base to the fullest possible extent and that</p>

<p>the New Zealand and the United Kingdom Governments should also</p>

<p>contribute. It is also considered that New Zealand should maintain</p>

<p>a base in Fiji.</p>

<p>22. The question of a base in New Caledonia requires special</p>

<p>consideration. A base on the Island would be useful for the</p>

<p>purpose of naval and air operations, but its main importance would</p>

<p>be to deny the use of the Island to an enemy. In the hands of an</p>

<p>enemy, it would constitute a direct threat to Australia’s vital</p>

<p>centres. The Defence Committee considers that arrangements should</p>

<p>be made for Australia to have access to facilities in New</p>

<p>Caledonia to ensure that it does not fall into the hands of an</p>

<p>enemy.</p>

<p>Extent to which Australia could maintain Bases</p>

<p>23. Apart from the naval commitments involved, it is thought that</p>

<p>it should not be beyond the capacity of Australia to maintain the</p>

<p>bases which it is considered must be controlled by Australia. The</p>

<p>naval commitment should be regarded as an Imperial obligation in</p>

<p>which Australia should participate so far as her resources permit,</p>

<p>having regard to the necessity for the maintenance of a balanced</p>

<p>Defence Force. The Defence Committee felt that any consideration</p>

<p>of the detailed questions of what would be involved in cost and</p>

<p>manpower in providing for such bases cannot be undertaken at</p>

<p>present.</p>

<p>Mutual Defence Problems and Interests of Australia and New Zealand</p>

<p>24. The maintenance of the integrity of each country is of vital</p>

<p>concern to the other. In particular, Australia and New Zealand are</p>

<p>mutually concerned with the establishment and maintenance of the</p>

<p>bases previously referred to to the north-east and east of</p>

<p>Australia and to the maintenance by naval and air forces of sea</p>

<p>communications in the Tasman Sea.</p>

<p>Desirable Forms of Mutual Assistance</p>

<p>25. It is considered that in addition to what has been mentioned</p>

<p>previously co-operation between Australia and New Zealand for</p>

<p>defence should be developed along the following lines:-</p>

<p>(a) the organization, equipping, training and exercising the armed</p>

<p>forces under a common doctrine;</p>

<p>(b) joint planning;</p>

<p>(c) interchange of staff,</p>

<p>(d) the co-ordination of policy for the production of munitions,</p>

<p>aircraft, shipping and supply items to ensure the greatest</p>

<p>possible degree of mutual aid consistent with the maintenance of</p>

<p>the policy of self-sufficiency in local production.</p>

<p>Defence Problems connected with Civil Air Transport</p>

<p>26. It is considered that the main problem from the point of view</p>

<p>of defence in the development of air transport in the Southwest</p>

<p>and South Pacific Areas is to ensure that air transport routes are</p>

<p>strategically disposed for defence and can be defended. Even where</p>

<p>such routes are not the most economical, it is considered that</p>

<p>they should be developed at any rate as alternatives. Only</p>

<p>friendly powers should be permitted to conduct air transport</p>

<p>services within these areas.</p>

<p>International Security System in Western Pacific</p>

<p>27. It is considered that in an area stretching from Singapore to</p>

<p>Fiji it is imperative that there should be an effective system of</p>

<p>international security which would involve joint responsibility by</p>

<p>the nations concerned for a coordinated defence plan. Under such a</p>

<p>plan, each participant should undertake definite obligations and</p>

<p>accept responsibility for the defence of a defined area, but such</p>

<p>a division of responsibility should be accompanied by arrangements</p>

<p>for active co-operation including the common use of bases within</p>

<p>the defined areas. So far as Australia and New Zealand are</p>

<p>concerned, the meeting of the naval commitments involved in</p>

<p>defending the areas allotted to them would require to be the</p>

<p>subject of a common Imperial defence policy. It is appreciated</p>

<p>that the foregoing are matters for inter-Governmental discussion</p>

<p>of the Pacific settlement.</p>
