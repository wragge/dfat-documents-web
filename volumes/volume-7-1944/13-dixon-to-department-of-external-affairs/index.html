<p>Cablegram 32 WASHINGTON, 13 January 1944, 1.32 a.m.</p>

<p>MOST SECRET</p>

<p>A meeting of the Pacific War Council was held January 12th. There</p>

<p>were present:-</p>

<p>The President. [1]</p>

<p>Ronald Campbell [2], Great Britain.</p>

<p>Leighton McCarthy [3], Canada.</p>

<p>Walter Nash, New Zealand.</p>

<p>Owen Dixon, Australia.</p>

<p>Osmena [4], Philippines.</p>

<p>Loudon [5], Netherlands.</p>

<p>Wei Taoming [6], China.</p>

<p>The President opened by remarking on the length of time since the</p>

<p>last meeting, saying that he had in the meantime travelled a good</p>

<p>deal, and that he considered the Pacific War was going pretty</p>

<p>well. He said that he saw no reason why the Pacific War Council</p>

<p>should not take part in the discussion of the question-what should</p>

<p>be done after the War about strategical bases and other places in</p>

<p>the Pacific.</p>

<p>He said that as we all knew he had seen Chiang Kai Shek first, and</p>

<p>afterwards Stalin. [7] The latter had offered no objections</p>

<p>whatsoever to what they had done at Cairo. He wanted no territory</p>

<p>in Asia, but considered that they were quite right in the plan</p>

<p>made at Cairo with reference to the restoration of territory to</p>

<p>China. He made no criticism of the idea of a Korean trusteeship.</p>

<p>He raised only one thing, namely, that Russia and the whole of</p>

<p>Siberia had no completely ice-free port. He, President Roosevelt,</p>

<p>had said in answer that there was only one place for it, namely,</p>

<p>Dairen or Port Arthur. Stalin asked whether he had thought about</p>

<p>it and he said ‘Yes he had talked of it to Chiang Kai Shek’, that</p>

<p>he had proposed to the latter that Dairen should be a free port,</p>

<p>free for the commerce of all the world. The railway to it belonged</p>

<p>to Manchukuo and automatically the railway would come under China.</p>

<p>But all that would be necessary would be to arrange that all</p>

<p>commerce should go over the railway to and from Siberia in bond,</p>

<p>so to speak.</p>

<p>Stalin said that was a very interesting suggestion and it appeared</p>

<p>that it might solve the problem.</p>

<p>He, President Roosevelt, had mentioned to Stalin that the Russians</p>

<p>should have the Kurile Islands so as to make the trade going in</p>

<p>and out secure from a military point of view. They had talked in</p>

<p>Cairo with Chiang Kai Shek about other islands, but nothing had</p>

<p>been settled. He could see no reason why the Pacific War Council</p>

<p>should not talk about them too.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai Shek had pointed out that the Bonin Islands and the</p>

<p>Luchu Islands [8] had originally been a part of China. Indeed,</p>

<p>China had once appointed the King to the latter. They were not</p>

<p>worth much except for military purposes and that to Japan. He, the</p>

<p>President, saw no reason why the civil administration should not</p>

<p>revert to China. if the United Nations considered that it was</p>

<p>important to have what he might call a policeman there, and it was</p>

<p>felt that China was not yet ready with planes and guns to play</p>

<p>that part, then he understood Chiang Kai Shek would have no</p>

<p>objection to that part being played by someone else under the</p>

<p>United Nations.</p>

<p>Then there are hundreds and hundreds of Islands mandated to Japan</p>

<p>which must be taken away from them. That raised the problem of how</p>

<p>they should be administered. Chiang Kai Shek and he were inclined</p>

<p>to think, although there was nothing final in their views, that a</p>

<p>United Nations body could be set up to administer them. He had in</p>

<p>mind the Marshalls, Marianas, and the Carolines. It was clear that</p>

<p>if anyone took them over it would be an out of pocket thing. They</p>

<p>must be administered for the good of the islanders and they were</p>

<p>of various races. For example, he understood the inhabitants of</p>

<p>Guam were entirely different from those of the Marianas Islands.</p>

<p>It would be an experiment if they were taken over by no single</p>

<p>nation, but were turned over to the United Nations as a body. But</p>

<p>when it came to the military end, it would be difficult to know</p>

<p>what in the future would be the important places. For instance,</p>

<p>Guam has a bad harbour but for aerial war it might be very</p>

<p>valuable.</p>

<p>The United States of America would be glad to act as what might be</p>

<p>called a ‘police agent’ in cases where another country, for</p>

<p>instance, the Chinese, were not ready for that part. How we should</p>

<p>manage the policing of the world in relation to these Islands is a</p>

<p>question we should all be thinking of. one thing suggested is to</p>

<p>invent a new kind of sovereignty, the sovereignty of the United</p>

<p>Nations.</p>

<p>South of the Equator, the islands fall really into three areas,</p>

<p>the Northern Islands, the Mandated Islands South, and the Dutch</p>

<p>area. It is not a homogeneous arrangement. It had grown up</p>

<p>fortuitously. Perhaps it would be possible to make some</p>

<p>arrangement in the allocation of those Islands.</p>

<p>Timor is another thing we should discuss. It is a thing which it</p>

<p>would be necessary for Churchill to talk about also in London.</p>

<p>Then there is the question-what we should do with the French</p>

<p>Islands. He, President Roosevelt, had said to Winston Churchill</p>

<p>that the French should not have New Caledonia back under any</p>

<p>conditions and that he believed that in this view Australia and</p>

<p>New Zealand would back him up. He had spoken only yesterday to</p>

<p>Admiral Halsey [9], who said whatever you do, do not give New</p>

<p>Caledonia back to the French. Its whole administration is a</p>

<p>disgrace. At present it is a big and important base. it could be</p>

<p>placed under the agency of Australia or New Zealand and Australia</p>

<p>might be joint agents for its development. It was. difficult to</p>

<p>say what word should be used. The word was not ‘mandate’, many of</p>

<p>the mandatories had considered the territories their own. Perhaps</p>

<p>the word ‘agent’ was the best.</p>

<p>He had sent Admiral Byrd [10] back to the Galapagos and the</p>

<p>Marquesas islands to examine their use in air routes. It looked as</p>

<p>if those Islands should be thrown open as international airports</p>

<p>of the world. Clipper ton Island is also French, and it might be</p>

<p>used on an air route going across Panama. He believed that, by and</p>

<p>large, air routes should be free to all the world with a</p>

<p>limitation against the use by aircraft foreign to any country of</p>

<p>its facilities to carry domestic traffic within that country. He</p>

<p>said he thought it was much the simplest way. Any airport in the</p>

<p>world ought, he thought, to be open for obtaining fuel and</p>

<p>supplies for the journey and for picking up and depositing</p>

<p>passengers. Leighton McCarthy interposed to say that he thought it</p>

<p>was the question of picking up that made it difficult and that,</p>

<p>for instance, the President would find that United States air</p>

<p>transport companies would object to Canadian aircraft picking up</p>

<p>passengers in the United States and taking them down, say, to</p>

<p>Mexico. But he was very pleased indeed to know that these were the</p>

<p>President’s views.</p>

<p>If the President thought fit to make them public, it would go far</p>

<p>to remove misapprehensions. The President said that Churchill knew</p>

<p>about them, though they had not been made public. He ought to add</p>

<p>that he could never get Congress to allow any United States</p>

<p>internal airline to be owned by external capital, for instance,</p>

<p>British capital, and he thought that this was right. In the same</p>

<p>way he learned from conversations in Brazil that the Brazilians</p>

<p>would not let a Brazilian internal airline be owned by Argentine</p>

<p>capital. Leighton McCarthy said that he believed that in the case</p>

<p>of Canada, control of Canadian internal airline systems would be</p>

<p>concentrated in a Government-owned Company-the Trans-Canadian.</p>

<p>The President said that Winston Churchill, Stalin and himself were</p>

<p>definitely determined that no aircraft should be made in Germany</p>

<p>and that the Germans should not teach aeronautics or the use of</p>

<p>gliders. They were very strong about that.</p>

<p>In answer to a question, the President said that the whole of</p>

<p>Sakhalin should go to Russia. He added that Salazar [11] was at</p>

<p>present making an awful noise about Portuguese Timor. He referred</p>

<p>again to the French possessions and said that on the Atlantic side</p>

<p>consideration must be given to Dakar and Cape Verde as strategic</p>

<p>points. There was also Madagascar. It was not intended that the</p>

<p>French Committee of National Liberation, or indeed any French</p>

<p>Committee should be told of any of these discussions or questions.</p>

<p>After all, it was not the French who were winning the War, and</p>

<p>decisions had to be made on what was best for the future.</p>
