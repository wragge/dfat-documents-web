                          <p>Australian High Commission, London, 26 November 1972</p>

<p>19079. Confidential</p>

<p><strong>Immigration into Britain</strong></p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>2 The following is a record of conversations with Sir Bernard Braine, MP<a href="#f1">1</a> on 24 November.</p>

<p><em>Record</em></p>

<p>3 Sir Bernard Braine telephoned me this morning.</p>

<p>He emphasised that he was speaking quite privately and asked that his confidence be respected.</p>

<p>He said that he had already spoken with the Acting High Commissioner for New Zealand.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard said that he had seen the Prime Minister in the middle of the debate on the new immigration rules on Wednesday night and had had a private talk with him.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister had ‘rather plaintively’ asked what he wanted.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard had said that the margin between him and the Government was not great, but he refused to believe that there were not one or two administrative changes that the Government could make to improve the climate and make things easier.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard explained that he fully realised the difficulties of substantially changing the rules, particularly the acute political difficulties.</p>

<p>But he thought the Government could do quite a lot to show that it cared for ‘the ordinary folk’, who would be confused and uncertain about the rules, and to ease their anxiety and to demonstrate that Britain was not simply casting off the old Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Small things could have big results.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard said that it was no use for him himself to put up ideas about changing the rules or easing administrative practices.</p>

<p>Anything he had to say would be all too easily resisted by the administration.</p>

<p>He therefore asked me to consider a series of suggestions as to how the rules could be amended and what Australia would like to see done in an ideal situation.</p>

<p>He could then be confident that he knew that [sic] he was talking about, that he was taking a realistic position and drawing attention to points of real substance.</p>

<p>Armed with such a list he would again approach the Prime Minister, but he would then put up the suggestions we (and the New Zealanders) made strictly as his own.</p>

<p>He would not reveal that he had had any contact with us and he regarded it as most important to his position that his contact not be revealed.</p>

<p>He repeated that he would expect anything he put forward to be knocked down and that therefore he wanted to be on strong and secure ground.</p>

<p>He said that there were some in the Government who cared a great deal about the old Commonwealth but that there were others who ‘do not give a damn’.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard said that in his view he was in a very strong position.</p>

<p>The Government wanted to present itself as appearing to listen sympathetically to complaints, but it did not want to be baulked in the passage of the new rules.</p>

<p>The situation was therefore extremely favourable to securing concessions.</p>

<p>I thanked Sir Bernard for ringing, said I appreciated his interest and that I would respect his confidence.</p>

<p>However, I had to point out immediately that I was in no position to offer him any guidance on policy aspects.</p>

<p>This area was very much a matter for the Government of Australia.</p>

<p>At this stage it had made no comment, and he would understand that the Australian Federal elections were now only eight days away.</p>

<p>Aside from the substance of the matter, ie the rules themselves, I could say to him privately that I thought it would be helpful if British offices abroad could make a special effort to explain the rules to enquirers and to help them ask the right questions.</p>

<p>The rules were complex and required careful and well-briefed explanation .</p>

<p>An area of great importance to us was the working holiday.</p>

<p>I had been glad to hear Mr Carr’s assurances that this arrangement would be fully preserved and I hoped it would continue to be administered liberally.</p>

<p>Further than this, I did not wish comment.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard asked me whether I thought he should also approach the Canadians.</p>

<p>I said that I could offer him no guidance and that this was purely a matter for his own judgment.</p>

<p>He said that he thought the Canadians were in rather a different position to Australia and New Zealand and that he would not approach the Canadians.</p>

<p>He asked me to send him a note of my suggestions by next Tuesday.</p>

<p>I gave him no undertaking in this respect and again pointed out that I did not expect Australian Governmental consideration of this question in the immediate future.</p>

<p>4. Please ensure that Sir Bernard’s position is fully protected.</p>
