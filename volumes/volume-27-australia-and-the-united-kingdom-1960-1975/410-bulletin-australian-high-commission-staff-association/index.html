                          <p>Australian High Commission, London, November 1972</p>

<p>It has been noted with some disquiet that a number of unfounded rumours have been in circulation amongst staff in connection with the transfer of administration from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to the Department of Foreign Affairs. Although many people have sensibly discounted such rumour, others have chosen to be alarmed at the thought of reduction in staff numbers and possible redundancy. It is in an effort to offset any alarm and to discourage the circulation of unfounded rumour that the following statement has been compiled. It includes a number of points made by the Acting High Commissioner, Mr Pritchett, when he met the Staff Association Committee recently. We wish to offer him our support in this period of interregnum and hope that staff will assist by acquainting themselves with the information which this bulletin contains.</p>

<p>When the Federal Government was first represented in London in 1906 by an Official Secretary and later in 1910 by Sir George Reid, the first High Commissioner, responsibility for foreign affairs was vested in a branch of the Prime Minister’s Department. The Department of External Affairs was created in 1935 but London remained the only overseas Australian government post until the appointment of ministers to the United States and Japan in 1939. In the post-war years, the Department has established substantial representation abroad, particularly in Western Europe, the United States and Asia, reflecting Australia’s increasing involvement in international affairs. The name of the department was changed from External to Foreign Affairs in 1970 and responsibility for the administration of the High Commission, London, was transferred from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on Wednesday 1st November 1972.</p>

<p>It is not anticipated that a successor to Sir Alexander Downer will be appointed until after the federal elections have been held in Australia in December; Mr Pritchett, who has been Deputy High Commissioner with special responsibility for Foreign Affairs since 1961, will be acting as High Commissioner until the new appointment is made. In order to assist in the smooth transmission of administrative responsibility, the Official Secretary, Mr Cumming, and the two Assistant Secretaries, Mr Watt and Mr Backen, have been seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs during their tour of duty in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>There have been stories in the London press about a decline in Anglo-Australian relations, which have arisen largely due to the imminent entry of Britain into the Common Market. Rumours have grown up about the possible effects of this entry on the work and staffing of the High Commission. Rumours are also in circulation about the transfer of administration to Foreign Affairs and the possibility of major changes at Australia House.</p>

<p>Locally engaged staff are employed under the High Commissioner (UK) Act and are governed by the High Commissioner (Staff) Regulations. These are legal documents enacted by the Federal Parliament in Australia and can only be changed by further parliamentary legislation. The High Commissioner Act Staff currently numbers nearly 900 and must of necessity have a set of regulations governing employment and conditions of service. Although at some future date it is possible that changes will be made, it must be stressed that these are likely to be gradual. Changes in the Regulations have occurred regularly in the past. No instructions have as yet been received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and no immediate changes are expected. The emphasis is on continuity and stability in the running of the Mission at the present time. The general expectation is that it will be many months before the Department of Foreign Affairs would be in a position to suggest changes of any significance; it will be necessary for the Department to inform itself thoroughly about the situation in London and, because of the size of the Mission, this will take some time to accomplish. There has been no general review of Australia House for many years and it is possible that such a step may be undertaken by the Department. It is impossible to predict changes which may be made or in which direction they may occur. It should be remembered that the needs of the departmental representatives must be met and that from time to time the workload in the various branches undergoes some change. This has always been the picture of Australia House.</p>

<p>With reference to the purported decline in Anglo-Australian relations, these are very complex and cover a wide field, many of which are beyond the scope of government. They are not in decline but rather in a healthy condition. Relations have obviously changed over the years and will continue to do so as circumstances demand. The relationship will continue to place major responsibilities and work on Australia House, any change or adjustment is likely to evolve over the longer term.</p>

<p>It is expected therefore that any changes which are considered desirable will take place only after thorough investigation and in an orderly manner. Members of staff should disregard information which comes from unofficial and unreliable sources, in particular from the popular press. Staff will be informed of any changes through official channels as they occur.</p>
