<p>IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>Draft of conditions for the round-table conference.</p>

<p>1. The Aim of the Round-Table Conference.</p>

<p>The aim of the Round-Table Conference is to bring about a just and lasting settlement of the Indonesian dispute, as soon as possible, by reaching an agreement with the participants concerning ways and means to accelerate the unconditional transfer of real and complete sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia, in accordance with the ‘Renville’ principles. [1]</p>

<p>The participants in the Round-Table Conference undertake to strive for the convening of the Conference by 1st August, 1949, and for the completion of the Conference within two months thereafter. The participants undertake to ratify agreements with results from the Conference within six weeks after its termination. Consequently, sovereignty should be transferred to the United States of Indonesia before the end of 1949.</p>

<p>The participants of the Round-Table Conference will be:-</p>

<p>(1) Representatives of the Government of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>(7) Application for representation of other significant interests who wish to express their views may be considered by the Conference.</p>

<p>5. Results of Conference.</p>

<p>The results of the Conference shall be laid down in documents and agreements binding upon the parties thereto. These documents and agreements shall be subject to ratification and shall include, inter alia, a charter of transfer of sovereignty, and the statute of the Netherlands/Indonesian Union, establishing fundamental provisions of future cooperation.</p>

<p>6. Ratification of the Agreements reached at B.F.O.</p>

<p>The documents and agreements referred to in sub-paragraph (5) shall be submitted immediately afterwards to the Netherlands States-General, to the provisional representative of the body of the Republic of Indonesia and, in a way to be decided upon in due time, to the representative bodies of the B.F.O. areas.</p>

<p>(1) The Provisional Constitution shall include provision with regard to the structure and powers of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>(2) It shall stipulate that the existing legislation, insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Provisional Constitution, or with agreement reached by the Round-Table Conference, shall remain in force until replaced by legislation enacted by competent organs according to rules to be worked out in the Provisional Constitution.</p>

<p>(3) All powers of the Netherlands Supreme Legislative Body of the Crown and of the Governor-General, including those which the Governor-General had in consultation with the ‘Volks Raad’, or the ‘Raad Van Nederlands Indie’, shall be vested in the Provisional Federal Government. The supreme authority with regard to foreign relations and the Federal Armed forces shall exclusively be vested in the Provisional Federal Government.</p>

<p>(4) The Provisional Constitution shall generally contain any provision inconsistent with the Charter of the Sovereign, the Statute of the Netherlands-Indonesian Union or other documents relating to future cooperation.</p>

<p>(5) The Provisional Constitution shall include the provision to guarantee effective realization of the rights of self- determination of the people of Indonesia and the holding of free and secret elections for the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>(3) An agreement with regard to the transfer of the rights, powers and obligations of Indonesia (The Netherlands Indies) to the United States of Indonesia.</p>

<p>(c) The Fundamental Provision of the Statute of the Netherlands/Indonesian Union.</p>

<p>In the Union, neither of the two parties, namely the Netherlands and the United States of Indonesia, shall be expected to transfer or concede any more rights to the Union than the other.
