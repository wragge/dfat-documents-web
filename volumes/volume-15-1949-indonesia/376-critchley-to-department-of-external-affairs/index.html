<p>Cablegram K306 BATAVIA, [5 May 1949], 6.15 p.m.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE CONFIDENTIAL</p>

<p>The parties are now seeking final consultation on the following statement which will be telegraphed by the Netherlands Delegation to The Hague today (5th May) and taken by Roem to Bangka tomorrow.</p>

<p>(a) Republican statement. [1]</p>

<p>‘As Chairman of the Republican Delegation, I am authorized by President Soekarno and Vice-President Hatta to give their personal assurance that they favour, in conformity with the Security Council’s resolution [2] of 28th January, 1949, and its directive [3] of 23rd March;</p>

<p>(1) The issuance of an order to the Republican armed adherents to cease guerilla warfare;</p>

<p>(2) Co-operation in the restoration of peace, and the maintenance of law and order, and;</p>

<p>(3) Participation in a round table conference at The Hague with a view to accelerating the unconditional transfer of real and complete sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia.</p>

<p>President Soekarno and Vice-President Hatta undertake that they will urge the adoption of such a policy by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia as soon as possible after its restoration at Djokjakarta.’ (b) Netherlands statement. [4]</p>

<p>(1) The Netherlands Delegation is authorized to state, in view of the undertaking just announced by Dr. Mohammad Roem, it agrees to the return of the Republican Government to Djokjakarta. The Netherlands Delegation agrees further to the setting up of one or more joint committees, under the auspices of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia, for such purposes as the following:</p>

<p>(a) To make necessary investigations and preparations preliminary to the return of the Government to Djokjakarta;</p>

<p>(b) To study and advise on measures to be taken in order to effectuate the cessation of guerilla warfare, and co-operation in the maintenance of law and order.</p>

<p>(2) The Netherlands Government agrees that the Republican Government shall be free and facilitated to exercise its appropriate functions in an area consisting of the Residency of Djokjakarta, and that this is possible in the light of the Security Council’s directive of 23rd March, 1949.</p>

<p>(3) Without prejudice to the right of self-determination of the Indonesian peoples, as recognised by the Linggadjati and ‘Renville’ principles [5], the Netherlands Government will refrain from the establishment or recognition of Negaras and Daerahs affecting the said territory.</p>

<p>(4) The Netherlands Government reaffirms its willingness to ensure the release immediately and unconditionally of all political prisoners arrested by them since 17th December, 1948, in the Republic of Indonesia.</p>

<p>(5) The Netherlands Government favours the existence of the Republic as a State to take its place in the United States of Indonesia. When a provisional representative body for the whole of Indonesia is to be established, and it consequently becomes necessary to determine the number of representatives from the Republic to the said body, this number will be one half of the total membership exclusive of Republican membership.</p>

<p>(6) Cons[onant] [6] with the intent of the Security Council’s rulings of 23rd March, 1949, on the subject of the proposed round table conference at The Hague to end that negotiations contemplated by the resolution of 28th January, 1949, may be held as soon as possible, the Netherlands Government is fully prepared to do its utmost that this conference take place immediately after the return of the Republican Government [to] Djokjakarta. At this conference, discussions will take place as to the way in which to accelerate the unconditional transfer of real and complete sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia in accordance with the ‘Renville’ principles.</p>

<p>(7) In the light of the necessity of co-operation and the restoration of peace and maintenance of law and order, the Netherlands Government agrees that in all those areas outside the Residency of Djokjakarta where the civil police and other officials of the Government of Indonesia are not operating at present the Republican civil police and other officials where still operating, will remain in function. It is understood that the Netherlands authorities shall afford to the Republican Government such facilities as may reasonably be required by that Government for communication and consultation with all persons in Indonesia, including those serving in the civil and military service of the Republic, and that the technical details will have to be worked out by the parties under the auspices of the U.N.C.I.</p>

<p>2. Agreement between the governments probably now [depends] on the Netherlands consenting to the Republican Government receiving the Residency of Djokjakarta. The main problem for the Dutch is the return of Maguwo airfield five miles out ofDjokjakarta. Van Royen has made no commitments, but has promised to recommend that his Government be as generous as possible. I have pointed out to Roem that paragraph (3) of the draft statement by the Netherlands would permit the formation of new states based on the claim that this was in accordance with the will of the people. Roem says that this section was drafted by Cochran and that in discussions, the Netherlands Delegation has assured him that there [will] be no new states.</p>
