                          <p>Cablegram unnumbered 2 February 1937, Herewi</p>

<p>On 10 July 1936 Cabinet approved in principle the appointment of Australian Counsellors at the British Embassies in Washington and Tokyo.</p>

<p>In a letter dated 14 October 1936 from the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, the United Kingdom Government agreed to the proposal, provided that the Australian representative in each case be subject to the authority of the British Ambassador, who was to have the right to see all communications sent to the Commonwealth Government. There was no apparent objection by the Commonwealth Government to these conditions.</p>

<p>In subsequent correspondence Eden passed on the suggestion of Sir Robert Clive, British Ambassador in Tokyo, that, because there would be insufficient work to occupy a full-time Australian Counsellor, the Australian Trade Commissioner in Tokyo, Colonel E.</p>

<p>E. Longfield Lloyd, should fulfil both functions. The Commonwealth Government, however, considered that the combination of Trade and External Affairs representation was an undesirable administrative arrangement and by November 1936 it had been decided to defer the Tokyo appointment. (For the documents on this subject, see AA: A981, EA Dept 152.) In cablegram 20 of 30 January 1937, not printed, the High Commissioner in London, S. M. Bruce, advised Prime Minister Lyons that the King had formally approved the appointment of an Australian Counsellor at the British Embassy in Washington.</p>

<p>Your No. 20. Appointment Australian Counsellor at Washington.</p>

<p>Desire you submit name of Major F. K. Officer, Department of External Affairs [1] for approval of Foreign Office and British Ambassador. [2] If approval forthcoming, a simultaneous and single announcement can then be arranged United Kingdom and Australia, both as to decision to appoint Counsellor and name of first appointee. Feel this would be preferable to two announcements provided there is no objection final point of procedure.</p>

<p>LYONS</p>

<p>THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE OF 1937</p>

<p>The last of the pre-war Imperial Conferences was held in London from 14 May to 15 June 1937 and was attended by representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Southern Rhodesia and Burma. Newfoundland was represented by the U.K. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the colonial empire by the U.K. Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

<p>The members of the Australian delegation and its advisers are listed below, together with the other principal delegates.</p>

<p>Planning for the Conference began in 1936 when it was agreed that its major concerns would be foreign affairs and defence, although there would also be some discussion of economic, constitutional and legal matters. Australia’s suggestions for the agenda are also listed below.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and the Dominions prepared a number of memoranda, some of which were circulated prior to the opening of the Conference, and further papers were prepared during the course of the Conference. A list of the papers prepared for the Australian delegation is also presented below, with the document numbers of those which have been printed in this volume.</p>

<p>Delegates attended plenary meetings for the opening and closing sessions of the Conference, on 14 May and 15 June respectively, and during the intervening month there were twenty meetings of principal delegates. Sub-committees gave specialised attention to a number of topics, including imperial shipping, economic questions, constitutional questions, civil air communications, polar questions and the New Hebrides. Opportunity was also taken by some delegates for discussions outside the Conference program itself, such as those between the Australian Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, and the Chiefs of Staff Subcommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (see Documents 35 and 47).</p>

<p>This volume contains only a small proportion of the extensive documentation prepared for and generated by the Conference.</p>

<p>Selection has been confined largely to Australian papers and speeches, but other material has been included to show reactions to Australian proposals and the context in which Australian statements were made. As with the rest of this volume, only matters of foreign policy are printed: technical considerations of constitutional, legal, economic, defence and other matters have been excluded.</p>

<p>A number of memoranda prepared for the Conference cannot be precisely dated. They are printed with the first (approximately) dated paper.</p>

<h2 id="agenda-proposals">AGENDA PROPOSALS</h2>

<p>On 18 November 1936 the United Kingdom asked the Dominions (circular cablegram B182) to indicate particular aspects of foreign affairs or defence policies they wished to discuss.</p>

<p>Australia’s suggestions were contained in cablegram 115 to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on 28 November, as follows:</p>

<p>‘We suggest that discussion on Foreign Relations should include-</p>

<p>(a) Review of the international situation, of British and Dominion foreign policies, including the relation and attitude of Dominion foreign policy to British foreign policy.</p>

<p>(b) Policy in regard to the League of Nations, especially in regard to questions arising out of proposed reform of the Covenant, embracing such issues as access to raw materials and return of colonies.</p>

<p>(c) Review of relations with particular countries having special significance vis-a-vis the United Kingdom or particular Dominions, eg. Japan, Germany, United States.</p>

<p>(d) British policy in the Antarctic, including operation of Whaling Convention.</p>

<p>(e) Inter-Imperial relations and status of Dominions, including specific questions such as method of consultation and treaty procedure.</p>

<p>(f) Nationality and status of married women and extension of principles involved in the Hague Convention.</p>

<p>(g) British policy in regard to the New Hebrides.</p>

<p>In regard to Defence, we consider that there should be-</p>

<p>1. A review of the political and strategical considerations relating to Imperial and local defence.</p>

<p>2. A review of problems relating to the basis of Australian Defence policy with special reference to- (A) Invasion; (B) Raids; (C) Priority of Provision for Defence; (D) Time Factor.</p>

<p>3. Consideration of the further development of principles of Imperial co-operation in Defence.</p>

<p>4. Consideration of Australian questions of an individual Service nature relating to the Navy, Army, Air Force and Munitions Supply Organisation.’</p>
