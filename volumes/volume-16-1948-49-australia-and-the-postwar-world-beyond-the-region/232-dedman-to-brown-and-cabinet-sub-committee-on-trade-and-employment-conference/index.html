<p>Cablegram G23, HAVANA, 9 January 1948, 8.43 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Committee dealing with chapter VI of the draft Charter on employment and economic activity under the Chairmanship of J.J. Dedman, it was today decided to submit the following resolution on employment to the Economic and Social Council.</p>

<p>[matter omitted]</p>

<p>Taking note of the resolution adopted by the second session of the General Assembly which approved the initiation of surveys of economic conditions and trends and requested recommendations by Economic and Social Council on appropriate measures relating thereto:</p>

<p>[1. Notes][1] that the Economic and Employment Commission and its Sub-Commission on Employment and Economic Stability have been instructed to consider the draft resolution on international action relating to employment prepared by the first session of the Prep[arator]y Committee and affirms its interest in the four measures specifically recommended for study in draft resolution.</p>

<p>[2.] Considers that the studies which have been initiated dealing with the achievement and maintenance of full and productive employment should be advanced as rapidly as possible and that attention should be given now to methods of ensuring that high levels of employment and economic activity shall be maintained even when special factors of temporary duration are prevailing in many countries have ceased to operate accordingly.</p>

<p>Suggests that with a view to making appropriate recommendations, the economic and social council in addition to the invest[igation]s which it has already undertaken:</p>

<p>(a) Request the submission at an early date, by members of the United Nations and by non-members represented at the present conference, of information concerning action which they are now taking to achieve or maintain full employment and economic stability and the nature of any prepared plans to prevent a future decline.</p>

<p>[(b)] Request the various specialised agencies to indicate the entire [nature] and extent of the assistance they are preparing to provide if a decline in employment and economic activity threatens.</p>

<p>3. Considers that in many countries the problems of p[ersist]ent surplus or shortage of manpower are linked with the attainment of full and productive employment and [that] their solution would advance the aims of the International Trade Organisation and accordingly:</p>

<p>Suggests that the Economic and Social Council initiate or encourages studies and recommend appropriate action in connection with international aspects of population problems as these relate to employment production and demand.</p>

<p>4. Considers that in relation to the maintenance of full employment it is advantageous to countries which require or receive and to countries which supply work[er]s on a seasonal or temporary basis to adopt regulations which will [mutually] safeguard their interests and also protect both the migrants and the domestic work[er]s against unfair competition or treatment and accordingly:</p>

<p>Suggests that the Economic and Social Council in conjunction with appropriate agencies such as International Labour Organisation and its Permanent Migration Committee consider the problem of temporary or seasonal migration of workers [taking into account existing treaties and long established customs and usages pertaining thereto, for the purpose of formulating in consultation with members directly affected,] conventions and model bilateral agreements on the basis of which individual governments may concert their actions to ensure mutually advantageous arrangements for their countries and fair conditions for the workers concerned.[2]</p>

II, P/P 79.</p>

<p>[2] The resolution was adopted by the Trade and Employment Conference on 4 February 1948 and submitted to the Economic and Social Council.</p>
