<p>Cablegram D555 LONDON, 31 May 1946, 1.15 p.m.</p>

<p>SECRET Received 1 June 1946</p>

<p>Refugees.</p>

<p>We have been giving further thought to the question of the form which the proposed new International Refugee Organisation should take. There seems to be five possibilities.</p>

<p>(1) The new Organisation could have been an integral part of the United Nations as we have always urged. This solution has been turned down by the Refugee Committee [1] as a result of joint pressure from the United States and Soviet Delegates supported by Latin American and Slav groups respectively. it could not now be adopted without complete reversal by the Economic and Social Council of the Committee’s recommendations and seeing how deeply committed the United States Government seem to be opposing it there seems little prospect of securing this.</p>

<p>(2) There might be a specialised agency including Slav powers as full partners but under ultimate control of the United Nations. We have tried to leave the door open for this. In our view if the Slav powers are to be full partners, ultimate United Nations control will be essential if we are to avoid danger of their being able to block all effective action. In view, however, of the determined efforts in the Refugee Committee to prevent any kind of United Nations control, it may be difficult to avoid inclusion in the Committee’s report of a recommendation against such a solution. In that case we should consider submitting a minority report.</p>

<p>(3) There might be a specialised agency including Slav powers as full partners which however would not be under any effective United Nations control. This is the solution likely to be recommended by the special Committee. We consider, however, that it would probably be unworkable and would in any case be most unsatisfactory as Slav powers have made it clear that their purpose is to prevent any effective assistance being given to political dissidents who constitute the majority of Refugees whom we want to help and their opportunities for obstruction in such a body would be almost unlimited.</p>

<p>(4) There might be specialised agency not under United Nations control but from which Slav powers would be excluded. This seems to be what the United States State Department have in mind, but is likely to be very difficult to secure now that Slav powers have become so deeply committed to the principle of having an effective voice in what is done about their dissident Nationals. Moreover recent indications are that they are determined not to be left out.</p>

<p>(5) There might be a specialised agency not under United Nations control but in which Slav powers should only participate to a strictly limited extent. This limitation might perhaps be secured by arranging that the Executive Committee of the new agency should consist only of representatives of powers making a material contribution to operational expenses of the new body. We are trying for this but if we are out voted may have to reserve our right to re-open the question before the Economic and Social Council. if this solution were adopted it might make it less difficult to secure eventual exclusion of Slav powers as suggested under (4).</p>

<p>2. His Majesty’s United Kingdom Minister Washington has been authorised to discuss the whole question with the United States State Department before matter comes up in Economic and Social Council.</p>
