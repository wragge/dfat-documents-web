                          <p>Committee of Good Offices USS RENVILLE, 17 January 1948 Document S/AC.10/CONF.2/2</p>

<p>UNRESTRICTED</p>

<p>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, referred to in this agreement as the parties, hereby agree as follows:</p>

<p>1. That a stand fast and cease fire order be issued separately and simultaneously by both parties immediately upon the signing of this agreement and to be fully effective within forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>This order will apply to the troops of both parties along the boundary lines of the areas described in the proclamation of the Netherlands Indies Government on 29 August 1947, which shall be called the status quo line, and in the areas specified in the following paragraph;</p>

<p>2. That in the first instance and for the time being, demilitarized zones be established in general conformity with the above-mentioned status quo line; these zones as a rule will comprise the territories between this status quo line and, on one side, the line of the Netherlands forward positions and, on the other side, the line of the Republican forward positions, the average width of each of the zones being approximately the same.</p>

<p>3. That the establishment of the demilitarized zones in no way prejudices the rights, claims or position of the parties under the resolutions of the Security Council of 1, 25, and 26 August and 1 November 1947.</p>

<p>4. That upon acceptance of the foregoing by both parties, the Committee will place at the disposal of both parties its military assistants who will be instructed to assume, in the first instance, responsibility for determining whether any incident requires enquiry by the higher authorities of either or both parties.</p>

<p>5. That, pending a political settlement, the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order and of security of life and property in the demilitarized zones will remain vested in the civil police forces of the respective parties. (The term civil police does not exclude the temporary use of military personnel in the capacity of civil police, it being understood that the police forces will be under civil control.) The Committee’s military assistants will be available to advise the appropriate authorities of the parties and to serve in such other proper capacities as may be requested. Among other[s], they should;</p>

<p>(a) call upon pools of police officers established by each party in its demilitarized zone to accompany the military assistants in their endeavours and moves throughout that demilitarized zone.</p>

<p>Police officers of one party will not move into and throughout the demilitarized zone of the other party unless accompanied by a military assistant of the Committee of Good Offices and a police officer of that other party.</p>

<p>(b) promote cooperation between the two police forces.</p>

<p>6. That trade and intercourse between all areas should be permitted as far as possible; such restrictions as may be necessary will be agreed upon by the parties with the assistance of the Committee and its representatives if required.</p>

<p>7. That this agreement shall include all the following points already agreed to in principle by the parties:</p>

<p>(a) To prohibit sabotage, intimidation and reprisals and other activities of a similar nature against individuals, groups of individuals, and property, including destruction of property of any kind and by whomsoever owned, and to utilize every means at their command to this end.</p>

<p>(b) To refrain from broadcasts or any other form of propaganda aimed at provoking or disturbing troops and civilians.</p>

<p>(c) To initiate broadcasts and institute other measures to inform all troops and civilians of the delicate situation and the necessity for strict compliance with the provisions sub (a) and (b).</p>

<p>(d) Full opportunity for observation by military and civil assistants made available to the Committee of Good Offices.</p>

<p>(e) To cease immediately the publication of a daily operational communique or any other information about military operations unless by prior mutual agreement in writing, except weekly publication of lists of individuals (giving names, numbers and home addresses) who have been killed or have died as a result of injuries received in action.</p>

<p>(f) To accept the principle of the release of prisoners by each party and to commence discussions with a view to the most rapid and convenient implementation thereof, the release in principle to be without regard to the number of prisoners held by either party.</p>

<p>8. That, on the acceptance of the foregoing, the Committee’s military assistants will immediately conduct enquiries to establish whether and where, especially in West Java, elements of the Republican military forces continue to offer resistance behind the present forward positions of the Netherlands forces. If the enquiry establishes the existence of such forces, these would withdraw as quickly as practicable, and in any case within 21 days, as set out in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>9. That all forces of each party in any area accepted as a demilitarized zone or in any area on the other party’s side of a demilitarized zone, Will, under the observation of military assistants of the Committee and with arms and warlike equipment, move peacefully to the territory on the party’s own side of the demilitarized zones. Both parties undertake to facilitate a speedy and peaceful evacuation of the forces concerned.</p>

<p>10. This agreement shall be considered binding unless one party notifies the Committee of Good Offices and the other party that it considers the truce regulations are not being observed by the other party and that this agreement should therefore be terminated.</p>

<p>For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands BADEN ABDULKADIR WIDJOJOATMODJO, Chairman of the delegation.</p>

<p>For the Government of the Republic of Indonesia DR. AMIR SJARIFUDDIN Chairman of the delegation</p>

<p>The signatures appearing above were hereunto subscribed this 17th day of January 1948, on board the U.S.S. Renville, in the presence of the representatives on the United Nations Security Council Committee of Good Offices on the Indonesian question, and the Committee Secretary, whose signatures are hereunto subscribed as witnesses:</p>

<p>Chairman: MR. JUSTICE RICHARD C. KIRBY (Australia) Representatives: MR. PAUL VAN ZEELAND (Belgium) DR. FRANK P. GRAHAM (United States) Secretary MR. T. G. NARAYANAN</p>

<p>Annex</p>

<p>CLARIFICATION OF THE AGREEMENT</p>

<p>1. As regards paragraph 1 of the foregoing agreement, it is understood that the two parties will endeavour to implement the various points of the truce agreement without any delay and with all means at their disposal; it is equally understood that, should one of the parties meet with special difficulties in carrying out fully within a few days any obligation imposed upon it by the truce agreement, upon notification to the other party the time limit of forty-eight (48) hours provided in the first article of the proposals will be extended up to a maximum of twelve (12) days.</p>

<p>2. As regards paragraph 2 of the foregoing agreement, it is understood that if, as expected, the truce agreement is increasingly implemented and the general situation continues to develop favourably, the demilitarized zones will, as a matter of course, be further extended. The question of an extension of demilitarized zones will upon the request of either party, be considered forthwith by the Committee’s military assistants who, acting within the intent of paragraph 5, will advise the appropriate authorities.</p>

<p>3. As regards paragraph 4 of the foregoing agreement, it is understood that the military assistants of the Committee of Good Offices will have every opportunity in the execution of paragraph 4 of the truce agreement, for determining whether any incident requires inquiry by the higher authorities of either or both parties, in which case they will of course at the same time refer the matter to their principal, namely, the Committee of Good Offices, whose services will be available to assist in adjusting differences between the parties in regard to the truce.</p>
