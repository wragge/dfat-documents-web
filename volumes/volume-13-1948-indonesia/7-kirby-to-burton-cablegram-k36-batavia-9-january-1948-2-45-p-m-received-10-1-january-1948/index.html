<p>My telegram 35.</p>

<p>TRUCE PROPOSALS OF THE NETHERLANDS DELEGATION</p>

<p>That a stand fast and cease fire order be issued separately and simultaneously by both parties immediately upon signing of this agreement and to be fully effective within 48 hours. This order will apply to troops of both parties along the boundary line of areas described in the proclamation of the N.E.I. Government on 29th August [2] which shall be called the status quo line and in areas specified in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>2. That in the first instance and for the time being, demilitarized zones be established in general conformity with the above mentioned status quo line; these zones as a rule will comprise territories between the status quo line and, on the one side, the line of Netherlands forward positions and, on the other side, the line of Republic forward positions of 18th August, the width of each of the zones being approximately the same.</p>

<p>3. That the establishment of demilitarized zone in no way prejudices the rights, claims o[r] positions of the parties under the resolutions of the Security Council of 1st, 25th and 26th August and 1st November. [3]</p>

<p>4. That upon acceptance of the foregoing by both parties, the Committee will place at the disposal of both parties its military assistants who will be instructed to assume in the first instance responsibility for determining whether any incident requires enquiry by higher authorities of either or both parties.</p>

<p>5. That pending a political settlement, responsibility for maintenance law and order and security of life and property in the demilitarized zones will remain vested in civil police (footnote:</p>

<p>the term civil police does not exclude temporary use of military personnel in the capacity of civil police, it being understood that police forces will be under civil control), forces of the respective parties. The Committee’s military advisers will be available to advise the appropriate authorities of the parties and to serve in such other proper capacities as may be spoken. [4] Among others they should(a) call upon pools of police officers established by each party in its demilitarized zone to accompany military assistants in their endeavours and moves throughout that demilitarized zone.</p>

<p>(b) promote cooperation between the two police forces.</p>

<p>6. That trade and intercourse between all areas should be permitted as far as possible; such restrictions as may be necessary will be agreed upon by the parties with the assistance of the Committee [and] its representatives if required.</p>

<p>7. That this agreement shall include all the following points clearly agreed to in principle by the parties:</p>

<p>(a) To prohibit sabotage, intimidation and reprisals and other activities of a similar nature against individuals, groups of individuals and property including destruction of property of any kind and by whomsoever owned, and to utilize every contingency at their command to this end.</p>

<p>(b) To refrain from broadcasts or any other form of propaganda aimed at provoking or disturbing troops and civilians.</p>

<p>(c) To initiate broadcasts and take measures to inform all troops and civilians of the delicate situation and the necessity for strict compliance with the provisions of sub (a) and (b).</p>

<p>(d) Full opportunity for observation by military officers. Council to be assisted. [5]</p>

<p>(e) To cease immediately publication of a daily operational communique, or any other information about military operations unless by prior mutual agreement in writing except the weekly publication of lists of individuals who have been killed, or have died as a result of injuries.</p>

<p>(f) To accept the principle of release of prisoners by each party and to commence discussions with a view to the most rapid and convenient implementation thereof, the release in principle to be without regard to [the nu]mber of prisoners held by either party.</p>

<p>8. That on acceptance of the foregoing, the Committee’s military assistants will immediately conduct enquiries to establish whether the elements of the Republican Military Forces continue to offer resistance behind the present positions of the Netherlands forces.</p>

<p>If enquiry establishes the existence of such forces these would withdraw as set out in the following paragraph. These enquiries and withdrawals are to be completed within a period of fourteen days.</p>

<p>9. That all forces of each party in any area accepted as a demilitarized zone or in any area on the other party’s side of a demilitarized zone will be under observation of military assistants [of the] Committee and with arms and warlike equipment move peacefully to territory on the party’s own side of the demilitarized zones.</p>

<p>10. This agreement shall be considered binding for a period of fourteen days and will automatically be extended for further periods of fourteen days unless one party notifies the Committee of Good Offices and t[he] other party that it considers the truce regulations are not being observed by the other party and that this agreement should, therefore, be terminated.</p>

<p>1 Examination of the inwards cable register indicates that the date of receipt, ‘9’ January on the cited copy, is incorrect.</p>

<p>2 Otherwise known as the ‘Van Mook Line’ (see Document 6, note 8).</p>

<p>3 On 1 August 1947 the Security Council called upon the parties to the dispute to cease hostilities and settle their dispute by peaceful means; on 25 August the Security Council voted to set up a Committee of the Council to assist in the settlement of the dispute; on 26 August the Security Council called upon the Republic of Indonesia and the Netherlands to adhere strictly to its resolution of 1 August; and on 1 November the Security Council called upon the parties to consult with each other to implement the cease-fire resolution of 1 August, either directly or through the Committee of Good Offices.</p>

<p>4 A sign here indicates ‘as received’.</p>

<p>5 Signs at the beginning and end of this sentence indicate ‘as received’.</p>
