                          <p>Singapore, 3 September 1963</p>

<p>494. Confidential Immediate</p>

<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>Kuala Lumpur telegrams 447<a href="#f1">1</a> and 560<a href="#f2">2</a> refer.</p>

<p>Sandys, Selkirk and Moore are in Kuala Lumpur today as a result of Federation Cabinet statement last evening which took British and Lee completely by surprise.<a href="#f3">3</a> Lee had insisted that some assertion of will towards independence through Malaysia was necessary for Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak. He and British were by agreement minimising publicity for his announcement for control over Defence and External Affairs until 16th September, and playing it in low key.</p>

<p>2. Federation Statement has, however, forced issue. United Kingdom will be obliged to make statement and look for ways of lowering temperature between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Lee has already reacted strongly to Federation Statement, saying that Malaya has no constitutional right to object to his action, and that doing so only supports those who argue Malaysia is Neo-Colonial.</p>

<p>3. Lee has told British Commission this afternoon he will ask Head of State tonight to issue writs for General Election. He did not specify date, but nominations will presumably close nine days from tomorrow. At this stage reasons are not clear, and we shall report further on this.</p>

<p>4. Facts of present situation, however, appear to be that Lee has:</p>

<p>(a) Made 16th September imperative for formation of Malaysia, and</p>

<p>(b) Created situation in which British would probably be unable to withold independence from Singapore, except by force, if Malaysia is not established on that date.</p>

<p>5. In the past Lee has shown awareness that Malaysia could not be ruled without support of majority of Malays in Federation, as well as support of main groups in Sarawak and North Borneo. It is difficult to accept therefore, assessment that he is preparing challenge for Tunku’s leadership at this stage. He does, however, feel that there has been lack of leadership and resolution in Kuala Lumpur, which he can exploit to his own advantage, at same time as rebuilding confidence in Malaysia, both here and in Borneo, which he thinks is necessary.</p>

<p>[NAA: A1838, 3006/4/7 part 9]</p>

<p>1 Number should read 557. Dated 3 September, it contained the text of a statement issued after an emergency meeting of the Malayan Cabinet on 2 September, which had been held to consider the implications of Singapore’s action in taking control over its own defence and external affairs, and Sarawak and Sabah assuming self-governing powers (see Document 101).</p>

<p>2 3 September, in which Critchley reported that the Malayan Cabinet was refusing to consider the demands being made by Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah.</p>

<p>3 The statement said that the Cabinet had considered Singapore’s action ‘neither legal nor constitutional and decided to make strong representations to the British Government’. It would also ‘seek clarification from the British Government’ as to Sarawak’s and Sabah’s reason for taking ‘action contrary to the Malaysia Agreement’ at this late stage.</p>
