<p>1. NUMBER AND TYPES OF IMMIGRANTS a. The Commonwealth will from time to time submit to PCIRO (at Geneva) particulars of the numbers and qualifications of desired immigrants. The first of these lists will be submitted within 30 days after approval of the Agreement’ b. The Commonwealth estimates that during the balance of 1947 the number of workers and dependents desired will approximate a total of 4000 persons.</p>

<p>2. SELECTION OF IMMIGRANTS a. The Commonwealth shall have the full right of selection by officers of the Department of Immigration of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth will advise PCIRO from time to time of the names and functions of officers nominated for this purpose.</p>

<p>c. PCIRO will be responsible for instituting such preliminary selection procedure as may be required by the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>b. Any selected immigrant who goes to Australia unaccompanied by relatives or dependents shall, after three months residence in Australia, have the right to nominate such relatives and dependents for admission, and the Commonwealth agrees to grant such admission providing the worth of the immigrant has been satisfactorily demonstrated and provided the immigrant is in a position to receive and support the dependents after their arrival in Australia.</p>

<p>4. TRANSPORTATION a. All expenses incurred in moving selected immigrants to Australia shall be met by PCIRO, and PCIRO will also be responsible for providing the means of transport.</p>

<p>b. The Commonwealth agrees to make an ex gratia payment to PCIRO of an amount of 10 per adult towards the extra costs incurred by PCIRO in moving immigrants to Australian ports as compared with the cost of moving them to South American ports.</p>

<p>8. CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT a. The Commonwealth will provide regular employment for all persons coming under this Agreement. It requires that workers agree to remain for at least one year in the employment accepted.</p>

<p>b. Immigrants will, after their arrival in Australia, enjoy exactly the same living conditions and wages as Australian workers performing similar work and will be treated in exactly the same manner and without discrimination in the case of unemployment.</p>

<p>They will be allowed to join trade unions in the same manner as Australian citizens.</p>

<p>9. CONDITIONS OF ENTRY a. The Commonwealth agrees to issue visas and entry permits without cost to the immigrants or to PCIRO.</p>
