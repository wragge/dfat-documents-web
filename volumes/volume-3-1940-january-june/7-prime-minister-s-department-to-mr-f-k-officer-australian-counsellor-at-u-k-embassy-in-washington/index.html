<h2 id="cablegram-unnumbered-8-january-1940">Cablegram unnumbered 8 January 1940,</h2>

<p>Following message to be released to Press at 10.30 p.m. Australian</p>

<p>time 8/1/40.</p>

<p>Broadcast by the Prime Minister [1] regarding the appointment of a</p>

<p>Minister to Washington.</p>

<p>‘I am taking this opportunity as Prime Minister of Australia to</p>

<p>tell you that arrangements have just been completed for an</p>

<p>exchange of diplomatic Ministers between the United States of</p>

<p>America and Australia. The first Australian Minister, who will</p>

<p>leave shortly to take up his appointment, is the Rt. Hon. Richard</p>

<p>Gardiner Casey, at present Minister for Supply and Development in</p>

<p>the Australian Government and formerly Treasurer or Chief Finance</p>

<p>Minister.</p>

<p>This is the first time that Australia has made a full diplomatic</p>

<p>appointment to a foreign country and the event is therefore of</p>

<p>great historic interest to us. We have for a long time felt that</p>

<p>the problems which concern the nations surrounding the Pacific</p>

<p>Ocean are of special and vital interest to Australia and that as</p>

<p>an independent nation within the British family of nations we</p>

<p>might quite reasonably expect to play an effective part in the</p>

<p>development and strengthening of peaceful contacts between all the</p>

<p>Pacific Powers.</p>

<p>I may say that we have under immediate consideration the question</p>

<p>of diplomatic representation at Tokyo: but our first appointment</p>

<p>has been made to the United States of America because, as a</p>

<p>British community, we feel that we have a great deal in common</p>

<p>with the United States and that by closer contact with them we may</p>

<p>contribute to a fuller understanding between the English-speaking</p>

<p>peoples of the world and, through that fuller understanding, to</p>

<p>the peace and well-being of the world.</p>

<p>The United States of America has no aggressive designs against any</p>

<p>other country. Neither has the British Empire. We have the same</p>

<p>general ideas of Government: we attach the same supreme importance</p>

<p>to the liberty of the individual: we have in common the conviction</p>

<p>that the proper object of all Governments is to forward the</p>

<p>happiness of ordinary men and women and not merely of a chosen</p>

<p>few. And we are the better able to exchange our ideas and to</p>

<p>forward our ideals by joint effort because we speak the same</p>

<p>language and share the same literature.</p>

<p>I say to you quite frankly that Australia attaches importance to</p>

<p>have [sic] the friendship of the United States and is prepared to</p>

<p>do much to improve it. But may I also say that I believe that the</p>

<p>friendship of Australia as an integral part of the British Empire</p>

<p>is of importance to the United States. The British and American</p>

<p>peoples have too much in common and, may I add, too many precious</p>

<p>ideas at risk in this turbulent world, not to realise that,</p>

<p>whatever their organic relation may be, they are both exercising</p>

<p>similar functions and that the safety and development of each is</p>

<p>of profound importance to the other.</p>

<p>Reciprocally with our own action, the United States Government has</p>

<p>agreed to establish a Legation at Canberra. [2] The American</p>

<p>Minister will be the first person to be diplomatically accredited</p>

<p>to Australia. Housed at Canberra, he will become for all</p>

<p>Australians the living embodiment of a gesture of friendship and</p>

<p>recognition by the United States. You may ask why, when there is a</p>

<p>British Ambassador at Washington, it is thought necessary to</p>

<p>appoint an Australian Minister. Somebody may say to you that this</p>

<p>sort of thing indicates that the various British nations are</p>

<p>falling out with each other. Nothing could be further from the</p>

<p>truth. The presence of an Australian Minister at Washington, so</p>

<p>far from weakening the position of the British Empire at that</p>

<p>capital, will strengthen it. Each British Dominion brings to the</p>

<p>British Empire not only unswerving loyalty to His Majesty the King</p>

<p>as the centre of that Empire, but also its own special knowledge</p>

<p>born of its own conditions. Just as we enjoy great privileges as</p>

<p>members of the British Empire, so we are subject to great</p>

<p>responsibilities. We must each play our own part. Just as we feel</p>

<p>that we are contributing effectively towards the future peace of</p>

<p>the world by sending Australian sailors and soldiers and airmen to</p>

<p>fight in Europe, so do we believe that by increasing our</p>

<p>diplomatic contacts around the Pacific, we will be contributing</p>

<p>powerfully towards that common understanding without which</p>

<p>permanent peace is impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. Casey is uncommonly well qualified to fill the distinguished</p>

<p>office to which he has been appointed. He served throughout the</p>

<p>last war, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the</p>

<p>Military Cross. For some years after the war he returned to his</p>

<p>profession as an engineer and was indeed for some time in the</p>

<p>United States. He was for some years Liaison Officer in London</p>

<p>between the Commonwealth Government and the British Cabinet</p>

<p>Secretariat of the Foreign Office [sic]. His experience in this</p>

<p>way has made him very widely known in British political and</p>

<p>official circles.</p>

<p>For the last seven years Mr. Casey has been one of the most</p>

<p>influential members of the Australian Government, exhibiting in</p>

<p>the complex financial and business matters with which he has had</p>

<p>to deal the highest qualities of capacity, energy and patriotism.</p>

<p>Less than a month ago he returned from London where he represented</p>

<p>Australia at a series of brief but important discussions on war</p>

<p>problems. He will thus go to Washington exceedingly well informed</p>

<p>on a great variety of matters.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that he will prove not only a distinguished</p>

<p>representative of his own country, but a real contributor to the</p>

<p>achievement of those national ideals to which I have referred.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that I believe most sincerely, it is that we</p>

<p>must all get to know one another better if the future of the world</p>

<p>is to be a peaceful future. The business of diplomacy is not a</p>

<p>mere business of dexterity in negotiation. Its real purpose is to</p>

<p>remove misunderstandings, not to create them. Its real</p>

<p>justification is peace.’ [3]</p>

<p>1 R. G. Menzies.</p>

<p>2 The first U.S. Minister to Australia, Clarence E. Gauss,</p>

<p>presented his credentials on 17 July 1940.</p>

<p>3 This cablegram was also addressed to S. M. Bruce, High</p>

<p>Commissioner in London, and to Lt Col E. E. Longfield Lloyd,</p>

<p>Government Commissioner in Japan.</p>
