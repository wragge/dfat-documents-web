                          <p>Letter 9 January 1940,</p>

<p>I read with great interest of the appointment of Mr. Casey as the</p>

<p>first Australian Minister to Washington, and would like to take</p>

<p>this opportunity to congratulate you for your unprecedented</p>

<p>leadership in building this necessary bridge across the Pacific.</p>

<p>Co-prosperity among the nations in the Pacific would be impossible</p>

<p>should one not be understood by the other. I can visualise the</p>

<p>gigantic contribution of this country, under your leadership,</p>

<p>towards the advancement of civilization of mankind and the</p>

<p>reconstruction of the world.</p>

<p>Last April, nine months ago, you mentioned to me the necessity of</p>

<p>a closer association and a better understanding among the Pacific</p>

<p>nations. I also learned of the desire of your Government to</p>

<p>establish diplomatic representations in Chungking and Tokio after</p>

<p>the completion of the procedure of establishing your Legation in</p>

<p>Washington. These two representations, when established,, will</p>

<p>join the one at Washington to bind the Pacific Powers watertight,</p>

<p>and the united efforts of the three Ministers of this great nation</p>

<p>under your leadership will be, as Confucius so aptly said, ‘the</p>

<p>old horse’ to lead the way towards permanent peace. I then cabled</p>

<p>to my Government and was instructed that China will be ready to</p>

<p>reciprocate at any time when preparation for diplomatic</p>

<p>representation of Australia to my country is made by you. This</p>

<p>view was conveyed to you in Canberra by me in person last May.</p>

<p>The press reported today your immediate consideration of a</p>

<p>Minister to Tokio. Under the present circumstances I cannot but</p>

<p>think that our most urgent task in building peace in the Pacific</p>

<p>is to remove Japan’s misunderstanding. The establishment of</p>

<p>diplomatic representation in Tokio will certainly help the work,</p>

<p>and your farsight deserves admiration. However, there comes to me</p>

<p>naturally a question; What will be the diplomatic relation between</p>

<p>Australia and China?</p>

<p>I know there is no misunderstanding between our two countries.</p>

<p>People may think, however, that as long as there is the Sino-</p>

<p>Japanese War, the conditions in China may not be settled; and</p>

<p>because of that they hold the view that a Minister to China should</p>

<p>be postponed. My dear Prime Minister, I personally think that</p>

<p>because of the Sino-Japanese War the exchange of diplomatic</p>

<p>representations between our two countries is more urgent than</p>

<p>ever. Whatever the outcome of the physical struggle between China</p>

<p>and Japan may be, China will not vanish, not only because her</p>

<p>power of resistance is increasing every day, but also because of</p>

<p>the fact that she is a civilization. I personally think that there</p>

<p>is no victory of any war in the real sense, and the result of the</p>

<p>Sino-Japanese War will be that Japan will have to abandon her</p>

<p>policy of aggressive activities due to the pressure of her own</p>

<p>internal as well as external difficulties, and that my country</p>

<p>will be so developed that she will be capable not only to guard</p>

<p>her own national independence but will also be able to shoulder</p>

<p>the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Pacific with her</p>

<p>sister nations. It is at this time that the exchange of diplomatic</p>

<p>representations between this great country, whose purpose is to</p>

<p>achieve peace in the Pacific, with China, whose national aim is</p>

<p>similar to that of yours, is most urgent. The appointment of a</p>

<p>Minister to Tokio without considering simultaneously one to</p>

<p>Chungking may enhance difficulties, if not jeopardise</p>

<p>international relations and status, to China, in view of the</p>

<p>present international situation. There may be some difficulties</p>

<p>connected with the appointment of an Australian Minister to</p>

<p>Chungking, but the urgency and necessity of such a move are so</p>

<p>intense and great that those difficulties can be easily overcome.</p>

<p>Please excuse me for taking this liberty to present this view to</p>

<p>you in such a personal way. Since we understand each other well</p>

<p>and because of the fact that it is of mutual benefit of our two</p>

<p>countries, I have not hesitated to ask your advice in this</p>

<p>connection. The appointment of an Australian Minister to Chungking</p>

<p>simultaneously with that of one to Tokio would help to clear</p>

<p>matters and maintain the balance of power which is indispensable</p>

<p>to peace with justice. I know my Government and my people will</p>

<p>give every facility for such an undertaking.</p>

<p>With my best regards and hoping to hear from you.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>a word or two to Mr. Menzies in regard to that matter’.</p>
